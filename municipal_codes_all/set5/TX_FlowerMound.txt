PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1989 Code, as supplemented through June 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1989 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert D. MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Paula Lawrence, Town Secretary, Terrence S. Welch, Town Attorney, and the other members of the town staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

All building and construction fees and charges are in the fee schedule set out in appendix A of this Code.

(a)  Purpose. Pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 380, the town may, subject to available funding and the conditions of this program, provide economic development incentives equal to the increase in property taxes for a single-family residential structure following the construction of improvements to, or the remodeling of, such residence. 
(b)  Incentive. The town may provide an economic development incentive equal to 100 percent of the increase in property taxes for the tax year following the completion of an approved project as the result of the increase in the certified appraised value of the residence as determined by the appraisal district. Said incentive will be based on the increase in property taxes in the first tax year following completion of the improvements. That amount will be multiplied by ten and paid in a single lump-sum payment (see example below). The economic development incentive shall be provided through a contract between the town and the property owner to be prepared and approved by the town attorney. The economic development incentive may be assigned one time in connection with the sale or transfer of the ownership (including a life estate) of the residence to a subsequent owner. In the event the residence is sold or transferred following an assignment, the economic development incentive agreement shall automatically terminate. 
(c)  Eligibility requirements. All residential property zoned single-family is eligible for participation in the program. Projects for home improvements, modifications or remodeling of single-family residences are eligible for the property tax rebate incentive provided the certified construction costs of the project are a minimum of $20,000.00. The project must be completed within 24 months after approval by the town as an eligible project for participation in the program. The property owner will be required to consent to periodic inspections by the town as the project is constructed. The property owner will be required to provide such information as the town staff may reasonably require to verify the costs incurred by the property owner for the project. Property owners or persons who are delinquent in payment of property taxes or other fees owed to the town are ineligible to participate in the program. 
(d)  Application. A person desiring to participate in the program shall submit an application to the neighborhood services division on a form provided by the town.

Sec. 14-495. - Conditions for occupancy of public rights-of-way. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions, as lawfully authorized by state and federal law, the town has first priority over all other users of the public rights-of-way. The town reserves the right to construct sewer, gas, water, drainage and other pipe lines, cables and conduits, to do underground and overhead work and/or change aerial facilities, in, across, along, over or under a public street, alley, or public rights-of-way occupied by a user, and to change the curbs, sidewalks, or the grade of the streets in accordance with state and federal law. Other projects within the public rights-of-way, such as beautification facilities, will not have higher priority over other users. 
(b)  The town shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among known users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each type of user and to the extent the town can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If the town authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the authorized users of the public rights-of-way. If the town closes or abandons public rights-of-way that contains a portion of a user's facilities, the town shall close or abandon such public rights-of-way subject to the rights of the user. 
(d)  Subject to applicable state law, whenever the town has determined that removal, relocation, change, or alteration of a user's facilities in the public rights-of-way is reasonably necessary for the widening or straightening of a street, or because the facilities otherwise interfere with the public use of the public rights-of-way, upon written notice by the town, the user shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of the user's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days, except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined by the town based upon information provided by the user. Prior to relocation, the town shall provide a suitable location within the public rights-of-way or another property or place for relocation of the facilities sufficient to maintain service. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, relocate, change, or alter, the town will confer with the user and will determine a reasonable period of time for the removal, relocation, change or alteration. Should the removal, relocation, change or alteration be deemed by the user to impose a significant financial hardship, the user shall have the right to present alternative proposals to the town and the town shall give due consideration to any such alternative proposals. This section shall not be construed to prevent a permittee's recovery of the cost of removal, relocation, change or alteration from private third parties who initiate the request for removal, relocation, change or alteration. If the permittee fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the town under this section, the town may pursue legal action to compel action by the permittee and to recover from the permittee any liabilities or damages incurred by the town on account of such delay. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (d), the town and the permittee may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such change. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, emergency conditions, accuracy and completeness of engineering plans or changes in design, relocation, coordination and other criteria which may delay projects. 
(e)  A permittee may trim trees in or over the public rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its facilities. All tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the town including the prohibition of tree topping. A permittee trimming trees within public rights-of-way shall be either certified or shall have initiated the process to obtain certification using the standards of Tree Line USA, a program sponsored by the National Arbor Day Foundation. The permittee shall make reasonable efforts to contact affected property owners prior to necessary tree trimming operations. Should the permittee, its contractor or agent fail to remove tree trimmings within 24 hours under routine circumstances, or within 24 hours after all service restoration activities have been completed under emergency conditions, the town may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the town, the permittee shall reimburse the town for all costs incurred within 60 calendar days.

(a)  A permittee shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably prescribed by the town with an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of Texas and acceptable to the town throughout the term of occupancy of public rights-of-way. At the time of registration, a permittee shall furnish the town with proof of insurance. The town reserves the right to review the insurance requirements and to reasonably adjust insurance and limits when the town determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the industry or the permittee require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the town will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the State of Texas or letters written by the permittee in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein. However, for the town to accept such letters the permittee must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the town, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the town. 
(b)  The permittee shall furnish to the town copies of certificates of insurance or proof of self-insurance evidencing the coverage required by section 14-502. 
(c)  Insurance policies shall: 
(1)  Name the town and its officers, employees, board members, and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable coverage. 
(2)  Provide for 30 days notice to the town for cancellation or non-renewal. 
(d)  The permittee shall immediately advise the town attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop and affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify. 
(e)  This section creates no right of recovery of an insurer against the town. The required insurance policies shall protect the permittee and the town. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. 
(f)  The policy "other insurance" shall not apply to the town if the town is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  The permittee shall pay premiums and assessments. A company which issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the town for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by the permittee must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the town in connection with damage covered by the policy.

(3)  Sexually oriented businesses require special supervision from public safety agencies of cities in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of such cities. 
(4)  Sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature. 
(5)  The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of cities which demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of its citizens. 
(6)  Licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations, and operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation. 
(7)  There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values. 
(8)  Police in numerous other jurisdictions have made a substantial number of arrests for sexually related crimes in sexually oriented business establishments. 
(9)  It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent areas. 
(b)  The town council desires to: 
(1)  Minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; 
(2)  Deter the spread of urban blight; 
(3)  Protect the citizens from increased crime; 
(4)  Preserve the quality of life; and 
(5)  Protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizenry. 
(c)  With regard to the licensing of sexually oriented business establishments, the town council makes the following findings: 
(1)  It is in the interest of the public safety and welfare to prohibit persons convicted of certain crimes from engaging in the occupation of operating a sexually oriented business. 
(2)  The town council, in accordance with Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 6252-13c, has considered the following criteria: 
a.  The nature and seriousness of the crimes; 
b.  The relationship of the crimes to the purposes for requiring a license to engage in the occupation; 
c.  The extent to which a license might offer an opportunity to engage in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person previously had been involved; and 
d.  The relationship of the crimes to the ability, capacity or fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the licensed occupation and has determined that the crimes listed in section 18-332(a)(9) are serious crimes which are directly related to the duties and responsibilities of the occupation of operating a sexually oriented business. The town council has further determined that the very nature of the occupation of operating a sexually oriented business brings a person into constant contact with persons interested in sexually oriented materials and activities, thereby giving the person repeated opportunities to commit offenses against public order and decency or crimes against the public health, safety or morals should the person be so inclined. Thus, it is the opinion of the town council that the listed crimes render a person unable, incompetent and unfit to perform the duties and responsibilities accompanying the operation of a sexually oriented business in a manner that would promote the public safety and trust. 
(3)  The town council has determined that no person who has been convicted of a crime listed in section 18-332(a)(9), is presently fit to operate a sexually oriented business until the respective time period designated in that section has expired. 
(4)  It is the intent of the town council to disqualify a person from being issued a sexually oriented business license by the town if the person has been convicted within the designated time period of any of the crimes listed in section 18-332(a)(9).

The provisions of the sections have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

Chapter 33 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
 
Sec. 33-1. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The Texas Legislature has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of Flower Mound, Texas are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(d)  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 06-18 , § 2, 3-5-2018)  
Sec. 33-2. - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
Appeal board means the town council. 
Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map ("FIRM") with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
Development means any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
Floodway. See regulatory floodway. 
Functionally dependent use means a use, which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Historic structure means any structure that is:

a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or; 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations. 
Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
Special flood hazard area. See area of special flood hazard. 
Start of construction , for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.) 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) [of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations] is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the national Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

e.  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with subsection 33-4(b)(1). 
(2)  Approval or denial of a floodplain development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
b.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
c.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
d.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
e.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
f.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
g.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
h.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
i.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use. 
j.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(d)  Variance procedures. 
(1)  The appeal board, as established by the community, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(3)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(6)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 33-4(c)(2) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(7)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter. 
(8)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(9)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(10)  Prerequisites for granting variances. 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(11)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria outlined in subsections 33-4(d)(1)(9) are met; and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 06-18 , § 2, 3-5-2018)  
Sec. 33-5. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 42-37, 33-4(b)(8) or 33-5(c)(3), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated 18 inches above the 100-year flood elevation established by a fully developed watershed, or the FEMA elevation, using whichever is higher. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in subsection 33-4(c)(1)a., is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 18 inches above the 100-year flood elevation established by a fully developed watershed, or the FEMA elevation, using whichever is higher or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood-proofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated 18 inches above the 100-year flood elevation established by a fully developed watershed, or the FEMA elevation, using whichever is higher; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of subsection 33-4(c)(1) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (b)(4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(c)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with subsections 33-1(b)(d) of this chapter. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of subsections 33-3(c), 33-4(c) and the provisions of section 33-5. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to subsections 33-3(b) or 33-4(b)(8). 
(4)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(d)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 33-3(b) are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 18 inches above the 100-year flood elevation established by a fully developed watershed, or the FEMA elevation, using whichever is higher or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 18 inches above the 100-year flood elevation established by a fully developed watershed, or the FEMA elevation, using whichever is higher or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 33-4(c) are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(e)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 33-3(b) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 33-5(d)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 33-5. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12 [of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations].

(e)  In order to ensure that an OSSF is designed, installed, and maintained properly, such that the OSSF will be more protective of the environment, site evaluations must be performed by either a registered professional sanitarian or a registered professional engineer; who must have successfully completed a site evaluation training course approved by the TCEQ, must be in good standing with their respective professional licensing program, and the site evaluation must bear their original seal and original signature. 
(f)  A properly designed OSSF is more protective of public health, safety and the environment; therefore, all design and planning materials for any OSSF must be prepared by a registered professional engineer or registered professional sanitarian, and bear their original seal and original signature. 
(g)  A properly installed OSSF is more protective of public health, safety and the environment; therefore, a licensed, registered OSSF installer must be present on site at the time of the final on site inspection. 
(h)  The town may periodically inspect any on-site sewage facility, in order to ensure that a condition threatening the public health, safety and environment is not present. 
(i)  A properly monitored system is more protective of public health, safety and the environment; therefore, any building/structure, which is not used as a single-family dwelling, using an on-site sewage facility and receiving secondary treatment of the effluent shall be checked and maintained monthly by a contracted TCEQ licensed maintenance provider, and reports made to the town once a month. A chlorine residual or fecal coliform test shall be made at each site visit where disinfection is required. One BOD and TSS grab sample test shall be conducted per year. The minimum acceptable test results shall be sent to the town within 14 days after the test was performed. 
(j)  All surface spray systems shall have timers installed and set to go off between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.

(5)  Promptly restore to its former condition any public property damaged by the oil and gas drilling, exploration or production operation. 
(b)  Bond, irrevocable letter of credit. 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of an oil, gas, or combined well permit the operator shall provide the oil and gas inspector with a security instrument in the form of a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit as follows: 
a.  Bond. A bond shall be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance institution authorized to do business in Texas, acceptable to the town. The bond shall become effective on or before the date the oil, gas, or combined well permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is fully restored, whichever occurs first. The operator shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the town, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and regulations of this article and the town. The original bond shall be submitted to the oil and gas inspector with a copy of the same provided to the town secretary. 
b.  Letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit shall be issued in favor of the town by a reliable bank or other financial institution, acceptable to the town, authorized to do business in Texas and shall become effective on or before the date the permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term. The town shall require a local banking association to be named as a confirming bank for purposes of presentment and collection in Denton or Tarrant Counties, Texas. The town shall be authorized to draw upon such letter of credit to recover any fines or penalties assessed under this article. Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit shall be submitted to the oil and gas inspector by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking or financial institution, with a copy of the same provided to the town secretary. 
c.  The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000.00 for any single well and shall not be less than $200,000.00 per pad site. If, after completion of a well, the applicant/operator who initially posted a single well or pad site bond has complied with all of the provisions of this article and such operator's well(s) is (are) in production and all drilling operations have ceased, the operator may submit a request to the oil and gas inspector to reduce the existing bond to $10,000.00 per well for the remainder of the time the well produces without reworking. During any re-drilling or re-working, the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be reinstated to and maintained at $50,000.00 for any single well and shall not be less than $200,000.00 per pad site. 
d.  If at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator, the oil and gas inspector shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, the town may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of $300,000.00 per well. 
e.  The operator agrees to renew the bond or irrevocable letters of credit prior to expiration thereof so the bond or letters of credit shall remain in full force and effect during the entire permit term, including any extension. The operator shall provide the town evidence that the bond or irrevocable letter of credit has been renewed at least 30 days prior to its scheduled expiration date. If an operator fails to timely provide the town with such certification of renewal, the town shall be authorized to immediately, and at any time prior to the expiration date of the bond or irrevocable letters of credit accepted hereunder by the town by presenting the original thereof, together with an affidavit executed by the town manager stating that operator is in default under the terms of this article. 
f.  Whenever the oil and gas inspector finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this article, a written notice shall be given to the operator. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the oil and gas inspector to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work so identified to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the town 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this article. 
g.  In the event of operator's failure or refusal to timely cure such a default, the town shall be authorized to draw against the irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the town shall have the right but not the corresponding obligation to proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed. 
h.  In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the commission, at the end of the permit term and the drill site and the operation site restored in conformity with the regulations of this article, the town shall have the right to assert a claim against the bond and/or make presentment of the irrevocable letters of credit accepted hereunder by the town by presenting the original thereof, together with an affidavit executed by the town manager stating that the operator is in default under the terms of this article. If the operator provides a bond, the operator as principal, and the guarantor of surety on the bond or the operator shall be liable to pay for the cost to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site and operation site in conformity with the regulations of this article. The surety shall be liable in the amount of the bond. If, however, the operator provides an irrevocable letter of credit, rather than a bond, then the operator shall be solely liable to pay for the cost to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site and operation site in conformity with the regulations of this article. Upon receipt of such monies, the town shall have the right but not the corresponding obligation to proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed. 
i.  When the well or wells covered by said irrevocable letters of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the commission and notice to that effect has been received by the town, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and canceled and returned to the applicant/operator.

(c)  Insurance. In addition to the bond or letter of credit required pursuant to this article, the operator shall carry a policy or policies of insurance issued by an insurance company or companies authorized to do business in Texas. In the event such insurance policy or policies are canceled, the oil, gas, or combined well permit shall be suspended on such date of cancellation and the operator's right to operate under such oil, gas, or combined well permit shall immediately cease until the operator files additional insurance as provided herein.

ARTICLE IX. - VESTED RIGHTS/PREEMPTION DETERMINATION 
 
Sec. 34-500. - Vested rights/preemption determination. 
(a)  Introduction and purpose. V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, chapter 245 ("chapter 245"), commonly referred to as the state's "vested rights law," provides an opportunity for persons to "freeze" or "vest" governmental regulations by filing a permit application. Other laws, such as V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, § 211.016 also provide certain vesting or "grandfathered" rights. To: 
(1)  Ensure that the town recognizes and protects all vested rights created by chapter 245 and other applicable laws; 
(2)  Ensure that all vested rights and/or state or federal law preemption determinations are made by the town only after the town is in receipt of all information necessary to allow the town to determine whether vested rights are present or whether state or federal law preempts certain areas of town regulatory authority; and 
(3)  Provide a method of administrative review of vested rights or preemption determinations, the town has established the following administrative procedure for consideration of any claim of a vested right under chapter 245 or other applicable vesting laws, and/or state or federal preemption. 
(b)  Vested rights/preemption submission. For purposes of article VII or article VIII of this chapter only, any person who believes that he has obtained a vested right under chapter 245 or other applicable vesting law, or that state or federal law preempts certain areas of town regulatory authority, and pursuant to chapter 34 of this Code, shall submit to the town secretary a letter explaining the factual and legal bases upon which the person relies to support his contention that he has a particular vested right and/or claim of preemption and, consequently, is exempt or not subject to a particular town order, regulation, ordinance, rule, expiration date, or other properly adopted requirement (hereinafter referred to collectively as "regulations"). Such written submission shall include, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  The name, mailing address, phone number and fax number of the person (or the person's duly authorized agent); 
(2)  Identification of the property for which the person claims a vested right or a claim of preemption; 
(3)  For a vested rights claim, identification of the "project," as that term is defined in chapter 245 at § 245.001(3); 
(4)  For a vested rights claim, identification of the original application for the first permit in the series of permits required for the project, as described in chapter 245 at § 245.001(1) and § 245.002(a) and (b); 
(5)  The date that the first permit in the series of permits required for the project was filed with the town; 
(6)  A chronology of the history of the project; 
(7)  For a vested rights claim, identification of all pertinent town regulations in effect at the time the original application for the permit was filed that (a) the person contends are vested and (b) the person contends controls the approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of an application for a permit, pursuant to chapter 245 at § 245.002(a) and (b); and 
(8)  For a vested rights claim, identification of all pertinent town regulations that the person contends do not apply to the project due to the vested rights provided the person by chapter 245 or other applicable vesting laws. 
(9)  For a vested rights claim or a claim that the town's regulatory authority is preempted under state or federal law, and if a person contends that certain town regulations do not apply to the project, the person is expected to identify, with particularity, all requirements that the person contends do not apply. Global references to a particular ordinance, statute or set of criteria, may be deemed insufficient and the town may consider the request for a vested rights or preemption determination to be incomplete and, hence, not subject to a staff determination at that time. 
(c)  Vested rights/preemption determination. The town secretary shall promptly forward the person's vested rights or preemption determination request, along with any supporting information or documentation provided along with the request, to the town manager and town attorney for their respective reviews. The town manager, after consultation with the town attorney, shall issue a final administrative determination of whether a vested right exists in relation to the project or whether the town's regulatory authority has been preempted under state or federal law, and shall identify, with particularity, all claims for vested rights that have been granted and all claims for vested rights that have been denied, or identify areas where the town's regulatory authority has been preempted under state or federal law. Prior to rendering his final determination, the town manager may request a pre-determination conference with the person to discuss the person's vested rights or preemption claim and to ensure that the nature of the claim is fully and completely understood by the town manager. The town manager shall act as the building official, pursuant to section 78-84 of this Code, as amended, for the limited purpose of determining vested rights or preemption claims under this article. 
(d)  Board of adjustment appeal. Any person who is aggrieved by or believes that the town manager's vested rights or preemption determination is in error, the person shall have the right to appeal such determination to the town's board of adjustment pursuant to section 78-84 of this Code, which board shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide the appeal pursuant to chapter 34 of the town's code of ordinances and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, ch. 211. 
(e)  Judicial review. Should the town or any person be aggrieved by or dissatisfied with the actions of the board of adjustment, either the town or the person may pursue all legal remedies to review the decision, pursuant to chapter 34 of this Code, as amended. 
(f)  Binding determination. The town manager's final determination, if not timely appealed to the board of adjustment pursuant to section 78-84 of this Code, shall be immediately filed in the town's files related to the project and the determination shall be considered binding upon the town and the person for the duration of the project. Similarly, any decision by the board of adjustment, regarding a vested right or preemption claim, if not timely appealed pursuant to chapter 34 of this Code, shall be filed in the town's files related to the project and the determination shall be considered binding upon the town and the person for the duration of the project. Notwithstanding the binding nature of the town manager's final determination and any ruling by the board of adjustment, the town and the person may, at any time, enter into an agreement that, to the extent authorized by law, modifies the final determination and the applicable regulations to be applied to the project. 
(g)  Filing date. The board's decision shall be deemed filed in the board's office on the first business day following the date on which action was taken by the board.

ARTICLE II. - WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPACT FEES 
 
Sec. 42-31. - Title. 
This article shall be officially known as the "Water and Wastewater Impact Fee Ordinance of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas." It may be cited as "this article." 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004)  
Sec. 42-32. - Authority. 
This article is adopted pursuant to the powers granted and limitations imposed by the constitution and laws of the state, specifically V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 395. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004)  
Sec. 42-33. - Purpose and intent of article. 
(a)  This article is intended to implement and be consistent with the town's comprehensive master plan and capital improvements plan. 
(b)  The purpose of this article is to ensure that adequate water and wastewater facilities are available to serve new growth and development within the town and to regulate the use and development of land so that new growth and development bear a proportionate share of the cost of such new water and wastewater capital improvements needed to serve such new development. 
(c)  It is not the purpose of this article to collect any money from new development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset the demand on the town's water and wastewater facilities generated by such new development activity. It is specifically acknowledged that this article has approached the calculation of proportionate share impact fees in a conservative and reasonable manner. 
(d)  It is in the interest of the public's health, safety, and general welfare for the town to regulate development and ensure the adequacy of water and wastewater facilities by requiring payment of proportionate share impact fees. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004)  
Sec. 42-34. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Capital improvement means any water supply, treatment and distribution facilities, or wastewater collection and treatment facilities that have a life expectancy of three or more years and are owned and operated by or on behalf of the town. 
Connection to water or sewer system means the filing with the town of a written application for a water or sewer tap and the payment of applicable fees, including purchase of a water meter. 
Equivalent residential connection means a service unit of demand for water and wastewater service equivalent to the demand generated by a typical single-family residence. 
Facility expansion means the expansion of the capacity of an existing facility that serves the same function as an otherwise necessary new capital improvement, in order that the existing facility may serve new development. 
Service unit means a standardized measure of consumption, use, generation, or discharge, attributable to an individual unit of development calculated in accordance with generally accepted engineering or planning principles for a particular category of capital improvements or facility expansions. For the purpose of water and wastewater impact fees, service units shall be expressed in terms of equivalent residential connections. 
Wastewater impact fee service area means a geographic area in which wastewater service is provided by the town. There are five wastewater service areas which are identified as the Long Prairie Service Area, Lakeside Service Area, Denton Creek Service Area, Prairie Vista Service Area, and Cross Timbers Conservation Service Area as identified in the town master plan, as amended. The Cross Timbers Conservation Area currently has no sewer service and there are no future plans to provide sewer to this area, thus there are no future system needs and no impact fees associated with this area. 
Water impact fee service area means a geographic area in which water service is provided by the town. For the purposes of this article, all land within the corporate limits of the town shall constitute one single water impact fee service area. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004; Ord. No. 08-10, § 3, 2-1-2010; Ord. No. 50-15 , § 3, 9-8-2015)  
Sec. 42-35. - Applicability of article provisions. 
(a)  This article shall apply to all development within the water and wastewater impact fee service areas. 
(b)  The total water impact fee required by this article shall be paid to the town in full at the time of application for building permit. The town will not furnish a water meter or allow connection to the water system if the applicant for such connection cannot furnish proof that the water impact fee has been paid in full to the town. 
(c)  The total wastewater impact fee required by this article shall be paid to the town in full at the time of application for building permit. The town will not allow connection to the wastewater system if the applicant for such connection cannot furnish proof that the wastewater impact fee has been paid in full to the town. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004)  
Sec. 42-36. - Timing of fee assessment. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) below, the water and wastewater impact fees shall be based on the cost per service unit in effect at the time application of building permit. 
(b)  The water and wastewater impact fees applicable to a lot or tract of land platted after the effective date of the article originally establishing water and wastewater impact fees for the town shall be based on the water and wastewater impact fees per service unit in effect at the time of such plat recordation, provided that the applicant shall submit evidence of the date of plat recording at the time of connection to the water or wastewater system. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004)  
Sec. 42-37. - Fee calculation. 
(a)  Fee base. The water and wastewater impact fees shall be based on the size of the water meter determined by the town engineer to be necessary to serve the development and the number of service units associated with that size of water meter. If the town allows a development to connect to the wastewater system without connecting to the water system, the town engineer shall determine the size of the water meter that would be required if the development did connect to the water system. The number of service units associated with various water meter sizes are as follows: 
Meter Size 	Maximum 
Continuous 
Operating 
Capacity 
(gpm)** 	Service Unit 
Equivalent 
5/8 " × ¾" PD* 	10 	1 
¾" PD* 	15 	1.5 
1" PD* 	25 	2.5 
1½" PD* 	50 	5 
2" PD* 	80 	8 
2" compound 	80 	8 
2" turbine 	160 	16 
3" compound 	175 	17.5 
3" turbine 	350 	35 
4" compound 	300 	30 
4" turbine 	650 	65 
6" compound 	675 	67.5 
6" turbine 	1,400 	140 
8" compound 	900 	90 
8" turbine 	2,400 	240 
10" turbine 	3,500 	350 
 
* PD = Positive Displacement Meter (typical residential meter) 
** Operating capacities obtained from American Water Works Association (AWWA) C700-15, C701-15, and C702-15. Turbine and compound meter flows are based on Class II (in-line) meters. 
(b)  Water impact fees. Water impact fees per service unit shall be calculated by dividing the maximum recoverable cost for impact fee by the projected number of additional service units, less any water impact fee credits applicable to the property pursuant to section 42-38. Based upon the adopted land use assumptions and capital improvements plan, the maximum recoverable cost to provide water service to a service unit is based upon a single town-wide service area as provided in exhibit B to this chapter. Based upon this cost per service unit, the water impact fees by water meter size are as listed in exhibit E attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes allowed by law. 
Exception. Water impact fees for nonresidential development shall be assessed at 50 percent of the maximum fee per service unit as provided in exhibit E. Further, water impact fees for nonresidential development determined to have met the criteria of the SMARTGrowth program, economic development incentive policy shall be assessed at 25 percent of the maximum fee for equivalent residential connections as provided in exhibit E attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes allowed by law. 
(c)  Wastewater impact fees. Wastewater impact fees per service unit shall be calculated by dividing the maximum recoverable cost for impact fee by the projected number of additional service units, less any wastewater impact fee credits applicable to the property pursuant to section 42-38. Based upon the adopted land use assumptions and capital improvements plan, the maximum recoverable cost to provide wastewater service to a service unit is based upon the four service areas that provide sewer as provided in exhibit C to this chapter. The cost-per-service unit for wastewater impact fees by water meter size is as listed in exhibit E to this chapter. 
Exception. Wastewater impact fees for nonresidential development shall be assessed at 50 percent of the maximum fee per service unit as provided in exhibit E. Further, wastewater impact fees for nonresidential development determined to have met the criteria of the SMARTGrowth program, economic development incentive policy shall be assessed at 25 percent of the maximum fee as provided in exhibit E to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004; Ord. No. 08-10, § 4, 2-1-2010; Ord. No. 50-15 , § 4, 9-8-2015)

Sec. 42-38. - Credits. 
(a)  If the town requires as a condition of development approval, or otherwise enters into an agreement with a developer, to have the developer construct, fund or otherwise contribute toward the cost of a capital improvement or facility expansion that is necessary to serve the developer's development and which is included in the adopted water or wastewater capital improvements plan, the town shall provide for reimbursement in the form of credits against impact fees that would otherwise be due from the development. Such credits shall run with the land and shall be used to reduce the amount of the impact fee that would otherwise be owed at the time of collection of impact fees. 
In determining the amount of such credits, the developer shall submit evidence of the actual, fair-market cost of the required improvements. The actual, fair-market cost shall then be reduced in the same manner and proportion as the actual assessed impact fee amounts charged by the town are reduced from the projected actual costs of impact fee capital projects of the same type facility (water or wastewater) in the same service area (the "reduced cost values"). Credits shall then be granted to the developer in an amount equal to such reduced cost values. Such credits shall only be applicable against the impact fees for the type of facility (water or wastewater) for which the capital improvement is made. 
(b)  The town may also enter into an agreement with a developer to have the developer construct, fund or otherwise contribute toward the cost of a capital improvement or facility expansion that is included in the adopted water or wastewater capital improvements plan and which is not necessary to serve the developer's development such as the oversizing of pipes, pumps or lift stations or the addition of extra facilities beyond the minimum standards required by the town's ordinances to serve the developer's development. The town may provide for reimbursement in the form of credits against impact fees that would otherwise be due from the development. Such credits shall run with the land and shall be used to reduce the amount of the impact fee that would otherwise be owed at the time of collection of impact fees. 
In determining the amount of such credits, the developer shall submit evidence of the actual, fair-market cost of the oversized improvements. If the amount of such credits would be insufficient to reimburse the developer for the cost of such oversized improvements or extra improvements beyond the minimum standards required by the town's ordinances to serve the developer's development, the town may provide for reimbursement to the developer up to the balance of the cost of such oversized required improvements from water or wastewater impact fees collected from other new development within the same service area. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004; Ord. No. 08-10, § 5, 2-1-2010)  
Sec. 42-39. - Accounting for fees and interest. 
(a)  All water and wastewater impact fees collected by the town shall be deposited in interest-bearing accounts clearly identifying the category of capital improvements for which the fees were collected. 
(b)  Interest earned on water and wastewater impact fees shall be considered funds of the account on which it is earned and shall be subject to all of the restrictions placed on use of impact fees under this article. 
(c)  Water and wastewater impact fee funds shall only be spent for the purposes for which they were imposed as shown by the capital improvement plan and as authorized by this article. 
(d)  The records of the water and wastewater impact fee accounts shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours. 
(e)  Water and wastewater impact fee funds shall only be used to pay the costs of constructing water and wastewater capital improvements or facility expansions, including and limited to the following:

(4)  Land acquisition costs, including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorney's fees and expert witness fees; and 
(5)  Fees actually paid or contracted to be paid to an independent qualified engineer or financial consultant preparing or updating the capital improvements plan who is not an employee of the town. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004)  
Sec. 42-40. - Refunds. 
All or any portion of a water or wastewater impact fee payment that has been collected by the town and has not been spent as authorized by this article within ten years for the date such impact fee was collected shall be refunded by the town, subject to the following: 
(1)  The determination of whether an impact fee payment made for a particular piece of property has been spent shall be based on the "first-in, first-out" accounting principle. 
(2)  Any refund shall bear interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in V.T.C.A., Finance Code § 302.002, or its successor statute. 
(3)  All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee payment was made at the time the refund is paid; provided, however, that if the impact fees were paid by another political subdivision or governmental entity, the refund shall be made to the political subdivision or governmental entity. 
(4)  The town shall provide a refund within 60 days of application for such refund, provided that the applicant provides all documentation necessary for the town to determine that the refund is due to the applicant.

Sec. 42-74. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Capital improvement means any roadway facilities that have a life expectancy of three or more years and are owned and operated by or on behalf of the town. 
Facility expansion means the expansion of the capacity of an existing facility that serves the same function as an otherwise necessary new capital improvement, in order that the existing facility may serve new development. 
New development means the subdivision of land; the construction, reconstruction, redevelopment, conversion, structural alteration, relocation or enlargement of any structure, or any use or extension of the use of land; any of which increases the number of service units. 
Road impact fee service area means one of three geographic areas in which development is served by the roadway facilities designated in the capital improvements plan. Road impact fee service areas 1 through 3 are shown in exhibit D to this chapter. These service areas cover the entire corporate boundary of the Town of Flower Mound. The boundaries of the service areas consist of the town limits or the most distant right-of-way line of existing or planned roads. Where an existing or planned road serves as the boundary between two adjacent service areas, the boundary shall be interpreted as the centerline of the existing or planned road. 
Roadway facilities means arterial or collector streets or roads that have been designated on the town's adopted thoroughfare plan, including all necessary appurtenances, and including town contributions to roadways or associated improvements designated on the federal or state highway system. 
Service unit means a standardized measure of consumption, use, generation or discharge attributable to an individual unit of development calculated in accordance with generally accepted engineering or planning principles for a particular category of capital improvements or facility expansions. For the purpose of road impact fees, service units shall be expressed in terms of vehicle-miles of travel during the p.m. peak hour. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004; Ord. No. 08-10, § 6, 2-1-2010; Ord. No. 50-15 , § 5, 9-8-2015) 
Editor's note Exhibit D is not set out herein, but is on file in the office of the town secretary.  
Sec. 42-75. - Applicability of article provisions. 
This article shall apply to all development within the road impact fee service areas. The total road impact fee required by this article shall be paid to the town in full at the time of issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy for new development. The town will not issue a building permit or certificate of occupancy if the applicant for such permit cannot furnish proof that the road impact fee has been paid in full to the town. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004)  
Sec. 42-76. - Fee assessment. 
(a)  Road impact fees shall be assessed at the maximum fee per service unit for each service area. Road impact fees shall be assessed at 50 percent of the maximum fee per service unit for nonresidential development for each service area. Further, road impact fees for nonresidential development determined to have met the criteria of the SMARTGrowth program, economic development incentive policy shall be assessed at 25 percent of the maximum fee per service unit. The impact fee per service unit for each service area is established in section 42-77 which shall be equal to the maximum impact fee per service unit. 
(b)  The maximum road impact fee per service unit is the sum of the eligible roadway impact fee CIP costs for the service area divided by the growth in travel attributable to new development projected to occur within the ten-year period as identified in the road impact fee capital improvements plan, based upon the land use assumptions for that service area. Based upon the adopted land use assumptions and the capital improvements plan, the maximum road impact fees per service unit for each service area are as listed in exhibit F to this chapter. 
(c)  For land platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and for which no replatting is necessary prior to issuance of a building permit, road impact fee assessment shall occur on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(d)  For land platted after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the road impact fee assessment shall occur at the date of recording of the plat. 
(e)  Following assessment of the road impact fee pursuant to this section, the amount of the road impact fee per service unit for that development shall not be increased, unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by submission of a new application for a record plat approval, in which case a new assessment shall occur at the assessment rate then in effect. 
(f)  Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new assessment shall occur at the time a new plat is recorded. 
(g)  A plat amendment pursuant to section 90-152 shall not be subject to reassessment for road impact fees. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004; Ord. No. 08-10, § 7, 2-1-2010; Ord. No. 50-15 , § 6, 9-8-2015) 
Editor's note Exhibit F is set out in Appendix A of this Code.  
Sec. 42-77. - Fee calculation. 
(a)  The number of service units (vehicle-miles of travel during the p.m. peak hour) generated by a development shall be determined from exhibit F attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference for all purposes allowed by law, subject to the following: 
(1)  References to square feet refer to gross floor area, as defined in the town's Land Development Code, Subpart B of this Code. 
(2)  When a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use or building requires the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, the number of service units generated by the development shall be based on the difference between the service units calculated for the previous use and the service units calculated for the proposed use. However, should the change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use or building result in a net decrease, no refund or credits for past road impact fees paid shall be made or created. 
(3)  In the event of a disagreement between the applicant and the town over the land use category applicable to a development, the applicant may present evidence supporting the appropriateness of a particular land use category, and the final decision shall be made by the town engineer. 
(4)  If the land use category is one of the "others not specified" categories, the applicant may present evidence in support of alternative trip rate and trip length factors, with the final decision to be made by the town engineer. 
(b)  Based on the adopted land use assumptions and capital improvements plan, the road impact fees assessed for each of the three service areas depicted in the service area map in exhibit C as referenced in section 42-1 are tabulated such that the net growth-related capital costs required to improve the road system to accommodate an additional service unit is dispersed uniformly within each service area. In no event shall the impact fees collected per service unit exceed the amounts provided for in section 42-76. 
(c)  Based upon the adopted land use assumptions and capital improvements plan, the road impact fees assessed for each of the three service areas depicted in the service area map in exhibit D as referenced in section 42-1 are tabulated such that the net growth-related capital costs required to improve the road system to accommodate an additional service unit is dispersed uniformly within each service area. In no event shall the impact fees collected per service unit exceed the amounts provided for in section 42-76. 
(d)  If the road impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. If the original calculation resulted in a fee that was too high, the difference shall be refunded to the original fee payer. If additional road impact fees are owed, no permits of any type shall be issued by the town for the building or use in question, or for any other part of a development project of which the building or use in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid, and the building official may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees. 
(e)  Road impact fees in each of the three service areas shall be as set forth in the fee schedule, attached hereto as exhibit F to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 30-04, § 2, 4-19-2004; Ord. No. 08-10, § 8, 2-1-2010; Ord. No. 50-15 , § 7, 9-8-2015) 
Editor's note Exhibit F is set out in Appendix A of this Code. Exhibit D is not set out herein, but is on file in the office of the town secretary.  
Sec. 42-78. - Credits. 
(a)  If the town requires as a condition of development approval, or otherwise enters into an agreement with a developer, to have the developer construct, fund or otherwise contribute toward the cost of a roadway facility that is necessary to serve the developer's development and which is included in the adopted road capital improvements plan, the town shall provide for reimbursement in the form of credits against impact fees that would otherwise be due from the development. Such credits shall run with the land and shall be used to reduce the amount of the impact fee that would otherwise be owed at the time of collection of impact fees. 
In determining the amount of such credits, the developer shall submit evidence of the actual, fair market cost of the required improvements. The actual, fair-market cost shall then be reduced in the same manner and proportion as the actual assessed impact fee amounts charged by the town are reduced from the projected actual costs of impact fee capital projects of the roadway facility in the same service area (the "reduced cost values"). Credits shall then be granted to the developer in an amount equal to such reduced cost values. Such credits shall only be applicable against road impact fees in the same service area in which the roadway facility was constructed. 
(b)  The town may also enter into an agreement with a developer to have the developer construct, fund or otherwise contribute toward the cost of a roadway improvement or roadway expansion that is included in the adopted roadway capital improvements plan and which is not necessary to serve the developer's development such as additional lanes, appurtenances and warranted signalization beyond the minimum standards required by the town's ordinances to serve the developer's development. The town may provide for reimbursement in the form of credits against impact fees that would otherwise be due from the development. Such credits shall run with the land and shall be used to reduce the amount of the impact fee that would otherwise be owed at the time of collection of impact fees. 
In determining the amount of such credits, the developer shall submit evidence of the actual, fair-market cost of the roadway improvements. If the amount of such credits would be insufficient to reimburse the developer for the cost of such extra improvements beyond the minimum standards required by the town's ordinances to serve the developer's development, the town may provide for reimbursement to the developer up to the balance of the cost of such oversized required improvements from road impact fees collected from other new development within the same service area.

(a)  All road impact fees collected by the town shall be deposited in interest-bearing accounts clearly identifying the category of capital improvements for which the fees were collected. 
(b)  Interest earned on road impact fees shall be considered funds of the account on which it is earned and shall be subject to all of the restrictions placed on use of impact fees under this article. 
(c)  Road impact fee funds shall only be spent for the purposes for which they were imposed as shown by the capital improvements plan and as authorized by this article. 
(d)  The records of the road impact fee accounts shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours. 
(e)  Road impact fee funds shall only be used to pay the costs of constructing roadway facility capital improvements or facility expansions shown in the capital improvements plan, including and limited to the following:

(1)  The determination of whether an impact fee payment made for a particular piece of property has been spent shall be based on the "first-in, first-out" accounting principle. 
(2)  Any refund shall bear interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in V.T.C.A., Finance Code § 302.002. 
(3)  All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee payment was made at the time the refund is paid; provided, however, that if the impact fees were paid by another political subdivision or governmental entity, the refund shall be made to the political subdivision or governmental entity.

(b)  If any vehicle is found in violation of any provision of this division or of state statute regulating the stopping, standing or parking of a vehicle, and the identity of the driver cannot be determined, the owner or person in whose name such vehicle is registered shall constitute a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of such vehicle is the person who committed the violation. This presumption is rebuttable and shall have the effects and consequences set forth in V.T.C.A., Penal Code § 2.05. 
(c)  The state department of transportation's computer-generated record of the registered vehicle owner is prima facie evidence of the contents of the record.

(f)  If a water customer damages, or willfully or accidently destroys the barrel lock after the water service has been disconnected due to non-payment and/or prior to establishing water service or prior to a town official reconnecting the water service after payment has been made, the water customer will be billed for the barrel lock, trip charge, and administrative fees as provided for in the fee schedule found in appendix A of this Code. 
(1)  Any other damage caused to the town's water system, such as cutting off the locking tabs on the angle stop, will also be billed to the customer's account to cover the cost of parts, labor, trip charge, and administrative fees for work completed by the public works department. 
(g)  Upon the request of any water customer, the town will check for a leak at the customer's water meter at no charge, provided, however, that such leak check shall not be done more often than once in a 12-month period. Any check for leak request of such customer's meter, more often than once in a 12-month period, shall be charged a fee for each additional leak check, as provided for in the fee schedule found in appendix A of this Code. If it is determined that there is a water leak on either the town's side and/or customer's side of the meter, the customer will not be billed a trip charge.

Sec. 70-58. - Residential and commercial water meter installation policy. 
(a)  Residential and commercial water meters five-eighths-inch by three-fourths-inch to two-inch non-compound HPT/T-10 water meters. 
(1)  The Town of Flower Mound has implemented a water meter installation procedure, which provides for the installation of water meters by individual contractors and/or builders. This procedure requires all contractors and/or builders engaged in new construction of residential or commercial building to install water meters using their own labor resources. 
(2)  Notice of non-compliance. 
a.  All contractors and/or builders are hereby notified that during the entire construction process, all installation procedures shall be followed. If any procedure is violated at any time during the construction process, an employee of the Town of Flower Mound shall issue a warning notifying the contractor and/or builder of the violation. The contractor and/or builder will then have three business days to have the violation corrected. If the violation is not corrected within three business days it shall result in all inspections of that contractor and/or builder to be suspended by the town, until such problem is corrected. 
(3)  Town supplied water meter materials. 
a.  All water meters five-eighths-inch by three-fourths-inch through one inch are supplied with the following materials: 
1.  One non-lead meter coupling; and 
2.  Two rubber meter gaskets. 
b.  All non-compound water meters 1.5-inch through two-inch HPT/T-10 are supplied with the following materials: 
1.  One non-lead meter flange; 
2.  Two flange gaskets; and 
3.  Four nuts and four bolts. 
c.  All materials supplied with the water meter must be used in conjunction with the installation of the water meter. It is the contractor and/or builder(s) responsibility to supply all other materials required in the installation of the water meter. On all commercial and residential curb stops one inch up to two inches that need to be reduced, the plumber shall use a meter adapter made of non-lead domestic brass (PVC reducers are not allowed in between the angle stop and the water meter). When connecting a five-eighths-inch by three-fourths-inch water meter to a one-inch curb stop, the plumber must use a non-lead brass reducer bushing with washers, no foreign brass products are allowed on the town's water system. See the town's "construction standards" for a list of approved manufacturers. 
(4)  Setting water meter requirements. 
a.  After the water meter is purchased, the contractor and/or builder(s) are required to set the water meter(s) within ten working days. After ten working days, if the water meter(s) is not installed, town personnel may ask the contractor and/or builder to return any such meter(s) to the customer service department until the meter(s) is ready to be installed. 
b.  When installing a T-10 or an HP Turbine water meter, the following installation instructions shall be followed: 
1.  All water meter(s) shall be installed by a licensed utility contractor, irrigator, and/or plumber at or before the plumbing rough in a horizontal position with the register dial facing upward. 
2.  Water meters shall be installed by connecting the inlet side of the water meter to the town's angle stop, no meter tails and/or couplings are allowed in between the water meter and the angle stop. 
3.  The line opening for the meter in between the curb stop and the customer's service line should match the lay length, allowing slight additional spacing for coupling gaskets. 
4.  The service line should be axially aligned with the inlet and outlet sides of the meter so that the coupling and meter threads can engage without binding or cross-threading. 
5.  The water meter coupling and/or flange must be attached to the outlet side of the water meter. 
6.  After the water meter has been installed, a water meter box/lid must be kept around the water meter at all times to help prevent the water meter from being damaged. 
7.  The curb stop and the water meter coupling nut and/or flange must be accessible without any obstructions from inside of the water meter box. 
8.  Water meters shall be installed at the address indicated on the water meter to prevent billing errors.

(6)  Setting and putting the water meter into service requirements. 
a.  After the water meter is purchased, the contractor and/or builder(s) are required to set the water meter(s) within ten working days. After ten working days, if the water meter(s) is not installed, town personnel may ask the contractor and/or builder to return any such meter(s) to the customer service department until the meter(s) is ready to be installed. 
b.  When installing a Tru/Flo Compound or an HP Turbine meter, the following installation instructions shall be followed: 
1.  The meter manufacturer along with the town requires that all Tru/Flo Compound and/or HP Turbine meters be installed with a plate strainer at the meter inlet. The strainer, in addition to protecting the meter from debris in the line, also corrects the velocity profile of the flow to the meter. 
2.  Install the Tru/Flo Compound and/or HP Turbine water meter horizontally with all registers facing upwards. 
3.  Do not install pressure reducing or check valves before the inlet-side of the water meter. 
4.  Do not open or connect any service pipe to the plugs located on the side of the Tru/Flo Compound water meter. These plugs are designed for the multi-jet meter low flow, allowing factory installation of a low flow water meter. 
5.  When installing a TRU/FLO Compound and/or HP Turbine meter, normal good piping practice should always be followed. In particular, all gaskets should be centrally located on their flanges with no overlap or interference with the pipe diameter. This is particularly important at the inlet connection to the meter where a gasket protruding into the flow stream will cause unpredictable velocity conditions. 
6.  Caution should be exercised to avoid air in the line, sudden flow surges, or excessive flow rates since these conditions may cause severe damage to the meter. 
7.  Water meters shall be installed at the address indicated on the water meter to prevent billing errors. If a water meter is installed at the wrong location, an administrative fee and a trip charge as set forth in appendix A of the Code of Ordinances will be charged to the contractor and/or builder(s) account for correcting the information in the town's billing system for each address. 
8.  Any contractor and/or builder found to be installing water meters not purchased through the town shall be in violation of section 70-59, entitled, "Town-issued water meter(s) mandatory." The meter(s) will be confiscated, the contractor and/or builder will be billed for the consumption that has registered on the meter, using a starting read of ten and all inspections for said contractor and/or builder may be halted until such violation is corrected and a penalty fee will be accessed for each occurrence as set forth in the fee schedule found in appendix A of this Code. 
9.  Streets with or without curbs must be marked with a straight saw-cut and painted blue at each service location to include domestic and irrigation meters. 
(7)  Before operation. 
a.  Before putting the TRU/FLO Compound meter in service follow these steps: 
1.  Before opening the valve at the main, make sure the by-pass, inlet and outlet valves are in the "fully closed" position. 
2.  Slowly open the valve at the main and let it pressurize the service line from the main to the inlet valve on the water meter. 
3.  Before opening the inlet valve, turn air bleed on meter cover counter-clockwise one to two turns. 
4.  With outlet-side gate valve closed, SLOWLY open inlet-side valve to pressurize meter. 
5.  Close air bleed screw (clockwise) when air is completely vented and no "spitting" occurs. 
6.  SLOWLY open outlet-side gate valve until downstream is pressurized. 
b.  After installation, it is important that the upstream (inlet) valve be put in the "full open" condition during service. A partially throttled upstream valve will cause flow profile distortion which will adversely affect meter accuracy. All throttling should be done ONLY on the downstream (outlet) side of the meter. 
c.  Before leaving the site, check for any possible leaks. If any leaks are discovered, shut the inlet-side valve down followed by the outlet-side valve slowly and make the necessary repairs. 
d.  At all times during the construction process the water meter vault shall be clean and free of debris. 
e.  If at any time during the construction process the water meter registers any negative usage, the contractor and/or builder will be required to install a backflow preventer device after the meter vault and before any usable water source at their expense. 
(8)  Looped and/or multiple water source connections. 
a.  All residential and/or commercial facilities that require two different sources of water or are on a looped system shall install a backflow preventer after the meter. 
1.  The backflow preventer shall be installed after the water meter and before the two water sources are connected - this will prevent any reverse flows along with any cross contamination of the town's water system. 
2.  The backflow preventer shall not be installed within two feet of the meter vault. 
3.  The backflow preventer shall be owned, operated, and tested annually by the facility at their expense.

(Code 1989, ch. 11, § 16.00(d), (e); Ord. No. 47-00, § 1, 7-17-2000)  
Sec. 70-405. - Hearing; payment of delinquent accounts; failure; termination of service. 
Upon hearing, the town manager shall have authority to make arrangements with any delinquent water customer for the pay out of any delinquent billing over a period of time not to exceed six months; provided, however, that should any delinquent customer fail to make payment of the delinquent account as agreed upon with the town manager, water service shall be immediately terminated without further notice. 
(Code 1989, ch. 11, § 16.00(f))  
Sec. 70-406. - Returned checks for insufficient funds. 
A check returned to the town for any reason stated thereon shall be assessed a fee as provided for in the fee schedule found in the appendix of this Code. A customer shall pay the amount due on the original billing, plus the insufficient funds fee, within three business days of receipt of notice from the town of a returned check. If the fee is not paid within three business days, service may be disconnected. Notice of disconnection may be served by U.S. mail or delinquent door-hanger tag, at the town's discretion. In the event of three returned checks from the same customer in a two-year period, the account will move to a cash-only status for a period of six months. If a customer presents a total of four returned checks in the same two-year period, the account will convert to cash only for the life of the account.

DIVISION 2. - LONGTERM WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 
 
Sec. 70-461. - Purpose and goals. 
(a)  The purpose of this long term water conservation plan is to encourage and promote efficient use of water resources, and to outline a strategy for achieving such efficiency. 
(b)  Opportunities for conservation exist through public education efforts, plumbing fixture improvements, and the responsible use of water that may allow the town and its customers to save water. This plan addresses various opportunities to conserve water and establishes specific strategies to realize those opportunities. 
(c)  Current Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) rules requires the adoption of specific water conservation five-year and ten-year goals as part of plan. No enforcement action will be taken against the town by TCEQ if these proposed goals are not met. The following table summarizes the town five-year and ten-year goals using 2014 per capita water usage as the benchmark, since it was the driest in the last five years. This is in compliance with TCEQ guidelines.

(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-462. - Conservation methods. 
The objective of water conservation is to permanently reduce the quantity of water required per person per day for living and business activities. The water conservation methods recommended by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Guidelines for Municipal Water Conservation and Emergency Demand Management are as follows: 
(1)  Education of the public and provide information to each retail customer; 
(2)  Plumbing codes to promote conservation; 
(3)  Retrofit of existing plumbing devices where warranted; 
(4)  Conservation oriented rate structure; 
(5)  Universal metering and meter repair and replacement; 
(6)  Water conservation landscaping practices; 
(7)  Irrigation practices; 
(8)  Water audits and leak detections; 
(9)  Recycling and reuse of treated wastewater wherever practical; 
(10)  Assumption of water supply corporations that are located within the town's corporate limits and conversion to surface water supply; 
(11)  Pressure control; and 
(12)  Encourage water conservation by owners of private water wells. 
In addition, various methods recommended by the TWDB for saving water are on file in the office of the town Secretary, incorporated herein, and will be made available to customers through an organized program. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-463. - Conservation program. 
This water conservation program is organized according to the conservation methods outlined above, and each method is described below. At the conclusion of this section, the steps involved in implementation and enforcement are outlined. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-464. - Public information and education. 
The following shall be done to inform and educate the public concerning long-term water conservation: 
(1)  Have a series of town meetings during the course of each major water and wastewater project to explain the purpose of the project and available alternatives, and explain how growth or usage is affecting the need for the project. 
(2)  Have on display at the Town of Flower Mound Offices at least three conservation items, conveniently organized to encourage customer use. Possible booklets or brochures available from the TWDB include: 
a.  "A Homeowners Guide to Water Use and Water Conservation" 
b.  "How to Save Water Inside the Home" 
c.  "How to Save Water Outside the Home" 
d.  "Water Saving Ideas for Business & Industry" 
(3)  Mail water conservation brochures appropriate for the season to each retail customer. The number of brochures mailed on an annual basis will be adjusted to maintain the effectiveness of the program. The program may include the following: 
Item 	Frequency 
(1) Water conservation message 	Annually 
(2) Water conservation brochure or bill stuffers 	Annually 
(3) Information on conservation programs 	As necessary, such as leak detection or reuse 
(4) Instructions for additional information 	Included with utility bills 
(5) Encourage local media coverage of water conservation issues and the importance water conservation 	
(6) Make information on water conservation available on the town website and include links to the Texas Smartscape website and to other sites with good information about water conservation, including TWDB and TCEQ 	
(7) Make information on water conservation available on Flower Mound TV (FMTV) 	
(8) Notify local organizations, schools, and civic groups that town staff, and staff of Upper Trinity Regional Water District (UTRWD), are available to make presentations on the importance of water conservation and the best ways to save water 	
 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-465. - Water conserving plumbing fixtures. 
The Town of Flower Mound will inform customers about water-conserving plumbing fixtures and encourage the use of such fixtures when replacing fixtures in existing homes and commercial and public buildings. The town shall require all plumbing fixtures to meet the water conservation standards established in V.T.C.A., Texas Health and Safety Code § 372.002, as listed below: 
(1)  Toilets: Maximum flush that does not exceed 1.6 gallons of water. 
(2)  Urinals: Maximum flush of one gallon of water. 
(3)  Showerheads: Maximum flow rate of 2.5 gallons per minute at 80 pounds per square inch, except where necessary for safety reasons. 
(4)  Faucets: Maximum flow rate of 2.0 gallons per minute at 60 pounds per square inch, for all lavatory, kitchen, and bar sink faucets. 
This program will be implemented by code inspectors and monitored by the town manager and shall become effective on the effective date of the adoption of this plan. It is not expected to increase the costs of code enforcement. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-466. - Reserved.  
Sec. 70-467. - Conservation oriented rate structure. 
(a)  The Town of Flower Mound recognizes that an increasing block rate structure will encourage water users to reduce water use and, thereby, increase water conservation. With an increasing block rate, the price per 1,000 gallons of water increases as the quantity used increases, thereby discouraging excessive and wasteful water use. 
(b)  The town has an increasing block rate structure as evidenced by the town's rate structure, which is on file in the office of the town secretary. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-468. - Metering and meter testing. 
The purpose of metering is to measure the quantity of water being distributed to customers throughout the system, to account for all the water being produced, and to accurately bill for the quantity of water delivered to each customer. The Town of Flower Mound recognizes the need for universal and accurate metering. The town's schedule for testing meters is as follows: 
(1)  Compound meters two inches and larger and HPT meters three inches and larger - Test, calibrate and repair annually. 
(2)  Meters two inches or smaller - Test and/or replace every ten years. 
These activities can be performed by the town as a part of its routine operation and maintenance activities. It will be monitored by the meter services section. It is expected that the costs will be offset by more accurate accounting and billing, resulting in enhanced revenues. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-469. - Water conservation landscaping. 
Well designed and properly maintained demonstration landscapes located in parks and other highly visible areas will promote the water-conserving landscape concept. As opportunities occur, the town will plan xeriscape landscaping for its parks and other facilities. Such landscaping should emphasize native species and low water consuming plant types. Also, the town will encourage garden clubs, developers and customers to implement water efficient landscaping. The town will participate with the UTRWD in demonstration gardens developed as part of the regional program. Brochures on water demand of certain grasses and on outdoor water use in general will be mailed to all customers initially and provided to all new customers. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-470. - Irrigation practices. 
The Town of Flower Mound will explore opportunities for conserving water through improved irrigation practices, including: 
(1)  Prohibiting wasteful uses of water from irrigation systems, such as: 
a.  Over-watering lawns and gardens in excess of what is actually required, thereby causing water to escape from irrigated areas or run off into gutters, ditches, streets, sidewalks, and other surface drains; 
b.  Watering during the heat of the day when losses due to evaporation are high; 
c.  Operating sprinkler systems during periods of rainfall. 
(2)  The partitioning of any given irrigation system so as to provide sequential operation of segments of the system rather than simultaneous operation. 
(3)  The distribution of a brochure providing helpful tips when a permit is issued for a sprinkler system and periodically thereafter. 
(4)  Require all new irrigation systems be in compliance with state design and installation standards (TAC Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 344). 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-471. - Water audits and leak detection. 
(a)  The town is aware of potential savings from leak detection studies and water audits. The town is committed to maintain low unaccounted-for water losses in its water system, and in recent years has experienced less than five percent loss because of the responsiveness of the various utility service departments and a relatively new water system. Although the current management practices have been successful in maintaining low water losses, the town currently does not have an established leak detection and repair program. The five-year and ten-year water loss goals are five percent and four percent, respectively. 
(b)  Audit results will continue to be evaluated. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-472. - Wastewater recycling and reuse. 
(a)  The leading types of potential recycling and reuse projects are: 
(1)  Use of wastewater effluent for irrigation of parks and/or golf courses. 
(2)  Transmission of wastewater effluent to a surface water reservoir project for treatment and reuse as a public water supply. 
(3)  Installation of gray water (water from the washing machine, showers, and bathtubs) tanks in homes for lawn and landscape watering. 
(4)  Recycling and reuse of treated effluent by, or for, industrial, commercial and institutional customersas well as for irrigation of open space, such as parks and golf courses. 
(b)  The town has two reuse water master plans that take advantage of nearby wastewater treatment plant effluent, one was adopted in 2014 and covers the western area of Flower Mound and the other was adopted in 2018 and covers the southeast area of Flower Mound. The treatment of wastewater effluent is recognized as an excellent method of conserving drinking water through the use of reuse water for irrigation purposes. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-473. - Pressure control. 
The Town of Flower Mound recognizes that adequate pressure control throughout its distribution system can improve water conservation. The transmission system should be sized to maintain a minimum pressure of 40 psi during normal operating conditions and a minimum pressure of 20 psi during extreme operating conditions. In addition, pressures above 90 psi are undesirable and should be avoided. The maximum pressure in extreme conditions should be limited to 120 psi because high operating pressure will result in increased system maintenance and increased operational cost. The transmission system should also be sized to limit maximum velocity in the transmission system to seven cubic feet per second. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-474. - Enforcement of article provisions. 
(a)  The water conservation plan will be implemented and enforced under the general direction of the town manager. Methods and costs of implementation are described below: 
(1)  Public information and education. The town will make copies available of the water conservation plan, including copies of the water conservation methods, to customers, civic groups and other groups upon request. Also, copies of the plan and literature will be given to the local newspapers for use in writing water conservation articles. 
(2)  Water conservation plumbing fixtures. The V.T.C.A., Texas Health and Safety Code § 372.002 et seq., sets out conservation standards for plumbing fixtures sold within Texas. These standards are listed in section 70-465, above. 
(3)  Water conserving landscape. The town will cooperate with the UTRWD in informing nurseries and the public of plants and shrubs that are native to the area. The budget for this activity will be included in the budget for public information and education. 
(4)  Leak detection and water audits. The town will be alert to leak detection, will emphasize water audits, and will repair leaks to save water and reduce operation costs. Technical assistance for leak detection and water audits is available from the TWDB and from the UTRWD. No budget increase is expected for this water conservation activity. 
(5)  Wastewater reuse and recycling. The use of wastewater effluent from the central sewage collection and treatment system for irrigation of parks, golf courses, or forage crops is incorporated in to the town's water master plan. Other opportunities will be considered. Any such use must be planned and evaluated on an individual basis. Also, opportunities for recycling and reuse of effluent by or for, industrial, commercial and institutional customers will be explored. 
(b)  The use of gray water systems in homes for lawn and landscape watering may be possible in some parts of the service area; but may not be acceptable within more densely populated portions of the service area. Gray water systems are most easily installed as homes are being built. Existing homes can be retrofitted with a gray water system at a higher cost. In the case of new homes, gray water tanks, piping, and pumping equipment for a family of four would cost approximately $4,000.00 to install. The costs to install such a system in existing homes may be considerably higher, since piping would need to be modified and pumps added. 
(c)  The town encourages water reuse and recognizes that the cost of water reuse will be borne by the beneficiaries. To the extent that water reuse saves water and lowers monthly water bills, the benefits can be used to repay the costs of reuse projects. 
(d)  The town manager will be responsible for implementation of the water conservation program. Punitive enforcement measures are not expected to be required. By adoption of this plan, the town is directing and authorizing the town manager to take all steps reasonably necessary to implement and enforce the plan. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-475. - Review and evaluation. 
The town shall maintain a record management system to record water pumped, delivered, sold and lost, which allows the classification of water sold and used by user categories (i.e., residential, commercial, public and institutional, and industrial). 
The town is required to submit an annual water conservation implementation report to TCEQ and TWDB. Said reports must be completed by May 1 of the following year for the previous year and used to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the town water conservation program. The results of the report may also be used to plan conservation-related activities for the following year. A copy of the report will also be sent to UTRWD, which will monitor the regional water conservation trends. 
As required by TCEQ rules, the town will review the plan every five years. The plan will be updated, as appropriate, based upon new or updated information. Should the plan be revised during any five-year period, an amended plan must be submitted to TCEQ within 90 days of being adopted. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-476. - Contracts with other political subdivisions. 
The town sells water to one small Water Supply Corporation for resale. 
(1)  Customer data for wholesale customer is as follows: 
Red Rock Water Supply Corporation 
P.O. Box 270103 
Flower Mound, TX 75027 
Annual usage in 2018: 8.3MG 
(2)  Contract requirements for successive customer conservation. The town will include a requirement in every water supply contract entered into or renewed after official adoption of the water conservation plan, and including any contract extension, that each successive wholesale customer develop and implement a water conservation plan or water conservation measures using the applicable elements of Title 30 TAC Chapter 288. If the customer intends to resell the water, then the contract between the initial supplier and customer must provide that the contract for the resale of the water must have water conservation requirements so that each successive customer in the resale of the water will be required to implement water conservation measures in accordance with the provisions of 30 TAC Chapter 288. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-477. - Coordination with regional planning groups. 
The town will provide a copy of this water conservation plan to the Region C Water Planning Group, which is responsible for developing regional water use information for the planning of future water needs. Flower Mound will cooperate with regional water agencies by providing information, participating in cooperative conservation programs, and with usage reductions initiated as a result of drought or other conditions. In addition, a copy of this approved plan will be sent to both TCEQ and TWDB.

DIVISION 3. - SHORTTERM WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 
 
Sec. 70-501. - Purpose and goals. 
(a)  The purpose of the annual water conservation plan is to establish the town's policy and procedures in reference to the use of potable water for outdoor watering and to encourage the prudent application of water to lawns and landscaping plants. 
(b)  Waste of water shall be prohibited, including such actions as permitting water to escape from irrigated areas or runoff into gutters, ditches, streets, sidewalks, and other surface drains; failing to promptly repair a controllable leak due to deficient plumbing after discovery; and other obvious wasteful uses. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-502. - Public education and information. 
Public information that can make the most immediate impact is the encouragement for proper watering of lawns and landscaping. Proper watering of lawns can further reduce usage while improving the health of the lawns at the same time. Information on outdoor water use will be published in the town's newsletter. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-503. - Water conserving plumbing fixtures. 
The town shall require water conserving fixtures on all new construction in the town.

DIVISION 4. - EMERGENCY WATER DEMAND MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Sec. 70-521. - Purpose and goals. 
The purpose of this emergency water demand management plan is to establish an orderly strategy for preserving and managing an adequate supply of water to protect and preserve the public health, safety and welfare of citizens and the general public from situations that threaten to interrupt or otherwise prevent the town from providing continuous water service. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-522. - Trigger conditions. 
The following four stages of drought or water storage and pumping conditions shall be used to determine the degree of urgency for initiation and implementation of the management plan measures. 
(1)  Stage 1 Triggers - Water Awareness - Water awareness conditions exist upon discovery or notification of potentially serious water management situations that can be managed through voluntary reductions in water use. Customers shall be requested to voluntarily conserve water and adhere to the prescribed restrictions on certain non-essential water usage as provided in the emergency management measures section of this plan. These conditions include: 
a.  Either wholesale water supplier(s) implement restrictive measures that require customers to implement similar restrictions for reasons such as conserving reservoir levels, maintaining system pressures, water treatment capacity, or other such items requiring cooperation; 
b.  Total water consumption reaches 75 percent of the town's water distribution pumping capacity; or, 
c.  The water supply system has a significant limitation due to failure of or damage to important system components. 
Stage 1 of the Plan may be terminated when Stage 1 conditions no longer exist and would be unlikely to recur upon termination. 
(2)  Stage 2 Triggers - Water Watch - Water watch conditions exist because of a failure in voluntary reduction and public awareness efforts to reduce demand, failures with equipment, inadequate supply, or diminished capacity. Customers shall be requested to adhere to both voluntary and mandatory measures to conserve water and adhere to the prescribed restrictions on certain non-essential water uses provided in the emergency management measures section of this plan. These conditions shall include any of the following: 
a.  Either average daily water demand reaches 90 percent of available supply for two consecutive days; 
b.  Average daily water demand reaches 90 percent of the town's water distribution system pumping capacity for two consecutive days; 
c.  Failures occur with town or wholesale supplier equipment or systems that result in a situation where demand reaches 90 percent of remaining supply or system capacity; or 
d.  Wholesale suppliers implement restrictive measures that require customers to implement similar restrictions for reasons such as conserving reservoir levels, maintaining system pressures, water treatment capacity or other items requiring cooperation. 
Stage 2 of the Plan may be terminated when Stage 2 conditions no longer exist and would be unlikely to recur upon termination. 
(3)  Stage 3 Triggers - Water Warning - A water warning condition exists because of a failure of Stage 2 management measures to reduce demand for water, or failures with equipment, inadequate supply, or diminished system capacity prevents meeting demand for water. Customers shall be required to comply with the requirements and mandatory restrictions on certain non-essential water uses provided in the emergency management measures section of this plan. These conditions shall include any of the following: 
a.  Either average daily water demand reaches 95 percent of available supply for two consecutive days; 
b.  Average daily water demand reaches 95 percent of the town's water distribution system pumping capacity for two consecutive days; 
c.  Failures occur with town or wholesale supplier equipment or systems that result in a situation where demand reaches 95 percent of remaining supply or system capacity; or 
d.  Wholesale suppliers implement restrictive measures that require customers to implement similar restrictions for reasons such as conserving reservoir levels, maintaining system pressures, water treatment capacity or other items requiring cooperation. 
Stage 3 of the Plan may be terminated when the Stage 3 conditions no longer exist and would be unlikely to recur upon termination. 
(4)  Stage 4 Triggers - Water Emergency - A water emergency condition exists because of a failure of Stage 3 management measures to reduce demand for water. This condition reflects the town's impaired ability to provide water service as a result of unforeseen failures and inadequacies in equipment and supply. Customers shall be required to comply with the requirements and mandatory restrictions on certain non-essential water uses provided in the emergency management measures section of this plan. These conditions shall include any of the following: 
a.  Either average daily water demand reaches 98 percent of the town's water distribution system pumping capacity for one day; 
b.  The water system is contaminated either accidentally or intentionally; 
c.  Major waterline breaks, or pump or system failure occurs causing unprecedented loss of capacity to provide treated water service; or 
d.  Wholesale suppliers implement restrictive measures that require customers to implement similar restrictions for reasons such as conserving reservoir levels, maintaining system pressures, water treatment capacity, or other items requiring cooperation. 
Stage 4 of the plan may be terminated when Stage 4 conditions no longer exist and would be unlikely to recur upon termination. 
(Ord. No. 19-19 , § 1, 5-20-2019)  
Sec. 70-523. - Emergency management measures. 
Adoption of this plan includes authorization for the town manager to implement the following emergency management measures in response to the aforementioned trigger conditions for the various levels of severity for drought or emergencies: 
(1)  Stage 1 Response - Water Awareness - Water awareness measures involve voluntary reductions in water use and encourage users to conserve water to avoid activation of more limiting management measures. The target of water awareness measures is to achieve a voluntary one percent reduction in total gallons per capita day (GPCD) usage. 
Specific actions to be taken during any drought situation will be determined by the town manager. The town manager may also take other actions not listed, if deemed necessary. The actions available under this measure include the following voluntary water use restrictions for reducing demand, except for item 1, which provide a menu of possible actions collectively and for different classes of water users as follows: 
a.  All water users. 
1.  All users shall refrain from lawn and garden watering, or irrigation, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. 
2.  Encourage the reduction of water use through a voluntary day-of-week watering schedule. Irrigation of landscaped areas with hose-end sprinklers or automatic irrigation systems shall be limited to Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays for customers with a street address ending in an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) and for locations without an address. Irrigation of landscaped areas with hose-end sprinklers or automatic irrigation systems shall be limited to Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday for water customers with a street address ending in an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). Apartments, office building complexes, or other property containing multiple addresses shall be identified by the lowest address number. Irrigation of landscaped areas is permitted at any time if it is by means of a hand-held hose, faucet-filled bucket, or drip irrigation. 
3.  Encourage reduction in the frequency of watering new and first year landscaping and foundations. 
4.  Encourage only initial filling of ornamental fountains or ponds. 
5.  Encourage reduction in the frequency of washing and rinsing vehicles and recommend the use of bucket/container, hand-held hose with positive shut-off valve or commercial car wash. 
6.  Encourage reduction in the frequency of draining and refilling of swimming pools. 
7.  Encourage reduction in recreational water use including the use of faucets, hoses, or hydrants which use water in such a manner as to allow run-off or other waste. 
b.  Municipal government. 
1.  Initiate a public education campaign teaching and encouraging reduced water use practices for both town water and water from private wells. 
2.  Notices will be published in local papers, will appear on local cable channel and posted on the town's web page informing the public of the trigger condition(s) prompting the measure and requesting that water users voluntarily reduce water consumption. 
3.  Increase public awareness through the distribution of conservation pamphlets, including water conservation tips on utility billings, and including notices and suggestions in newsletters. 
4.  Weekly status updates on the condition(s) causing activation of the management measure will be displayed on the local cable television channel and appear on the town's website. 
5.  Waste of water shall be prohibited by eliminating such actions that allow excessive amounts of water to escape from irrigated areas as runoff into gutters, ditches, streets, and other surface drains; failing to promptly repair a controllable leak; and, other obvious wasteful uses and conditions. 
6.  Intensify normal leak detection and repair activities on waterlines. 
7.  Encourage reduction of water use in town-owned ornamental fountains or ponds. 
8.  Encourage reduction in water use for landscaping for parks and athletic fields. 
c.  Commercial customers. 
1.  Commercial users, home owners associations, and other non-residential irrigation system owners will be contacted and asked to reduce water use by inspecting their systems. Corrective measures would limit over watering to prevent runoff, repairing broken or damaged sprinkler heads, and repair of any leaks that may be identified. 
2.  Identify and encourage voluntary reduction measures by high-volume water users through water audits. 
3.  Encourage reduction in water use for landscaping for commercial landscaping, open space, parks and golf courses. 
4.  Encourage reduction in water use for landscape nursery stock. 
(2)  Stage 2 Response - Water Watch - Water watch measures impose usage restrictions on consumers as a result of ineffective Stage 1 measures, or because Stage 2 conditions require immediate implementation of Stage 2 measures. The Stage 2 management measures provide for limiting use and enforcement of the restrictions. The target of water watch measures is to achieve a five percent reduction in total gallons per capita day (GPCD) usage. 
Specific actions taken during any drought situation will be determined by the town manager. The town manager may also take other actions not listed, if deemed necessary. The actions available under this measure include the following mandatory water use restrictions for reducing demand which provide a menu of possible actions collectively and for different classes of water users as follow: 
a.  All water users. 
1.  Required reduction of water use through mandatory day-of-week landscape watering schedule and required watering only during off-peak hours. Irrigation of landscaped areas with hose-end sprinklers or automatic irrigation systems shall be limited to Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday for customers with a street address ending in an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) and for locations without addresses, and Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday for water customers with a street address ending in an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).

a.  Upon receipt of a written protest, a proposed amendment, supplement, or change shall become effective only upon the favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members of the town council when such protest meets one or more of the following enumerated conditions: 
i.  When such protest contains the signatures of the owner or the owners of 20 percent or more of the total area of the land (whether platted or otherwise) included within the boundaries of the proposed change, or 
ii.  When such protest contains the signatures of the owner or owners of 20 percent or more of the total area of land (whether platted or otherwise) outside of the boundaries of the proposed change and within 200 feet of any point of the land proposed to be changed. 
For purposes of this section the terms "owner" and "owners" shall mean and refer to those persons or entities indicated by the most recently approved municipal tax roll as owning such land. 
b.  All protests must be submitted to the town secretary in writing. Such written protest(s) should be in the form of a petition containing the zoning case number, the name of the protesting property owner, the address(es) or property description(s) of the property for which the property owner is asserting a protest, the reasons for the property owner's protest such as the zoning classifications or uses to which the property owner is opposed, and the verified signature of the protesting property owner(s) or a verification by the person submitting the petition confirming the authenticity of the signatures contained thereon.

A protest sent through the mail must be received by the town secretary before the deadline. 
d.  A person may by written request withdraw their signature from the protest at any time prior to the close of the public hearing only. If the withdrawal of an owner's signature from a protest reduces the percentage of land area ownership protesting the zoning change to less than 20 percent of the total area of land a three-fourths vote for approval of the zoning change shall not be required. 
e.  The plain wording of the protest(s) shall determine whether a three-fourths vote is required for approval of the advertised zoning district applied for by the applicant or any less intensive zoning classification that the town council decides to grant. 
(2)  A waiting period of one year, between the date an application for amendment to the comprehensive master plan or a requested change in zoning is denied by the town council and a new application for such a change or amendment is accepted, is hereby established. For purposes of this article, "denied by the town council" shall mean that a motion by the town council to deny the requested zoning change passed by a majority of the quorum present and voting, or that a motion by the town council to approve the requested zoning change failed for lack of having the necessary votes, or that a motion by the town council to approve or deny the requested zoning change resulted in a tie vote. The one-year waiting period shall be applicable to all requested amendments and changes for the same or a more intensive land use categories, or zoning districts, on all or any portion of the property previously considered for amendment or change in land use or zoning; provided, however, that such one-year waiting period shall not be applicable to any proposed amendment or change instituted by the town council or planning and zoning commission, or to a request for an amendment or change that is denied by the town council without prejudice. A property owner may apply for a waiver of the one-year waiting period as follows: 
a.  The applicant shall submit a request in writing to the town office of community development within ten days of the denial by the town council. Upon the filing of a request within the required time period, the office of community development shall inform the applicant in writing of the date on which the planning and zoning commission shall consider the request and advise the applicant of his rights to appear before the planning and zoning commission. 
b.  The planning and zoning commission may waive the one-year waiting period upon a finding that the circumstances surrounding the property have changed sufficiently to warrant the acceptance of a new application for a comprehensive master plan or zoning amendment or change prior to the end of the one-year waiting period. A majority of the planning and zoning commission quorum present and voting shall be required to grant any such request. If the request is granted, compliance with the procedures contained in subpart B of this Code and other applicable rules and regulations of the town shall be required. 
c.  The applicant may appeal a denial under this article by the planning and zoning commission to the town council by filing a request in writing with the town office of community development within ten days of the denial by the planning and zoning commission. 
d.  The decision of the town council regarding the request for a waiver shall be final. 
(e)  Approval conditions. From the effective date of subpart B of this Code, approval of a planned development district shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  From the effective date of the ordinance granting a planned development district, a record plat for the property must be recorded within five years, in accordance with the following: 
a.  If the property is less than 100 acres, a record plat must be recorded for the entire property. 
b.  If the property is 100 acres or more, a record plat must be recorded for 50 percent of the property or 100 acres, whichever is greater.

Sec. 78-231. - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
(a)  Nonconforming status. The use of land, use of a structure, or a structure itself shall be deemed to have nonconforming status when each of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The use or structure that does not conform to the regulations prescribed in the district in which such use or structure is located was in existence and lawfully constructed, located and operating prior to, and at the time of, the event or action that made such use or structure nonconforming. 
(2)  The event or action that made such use or structure nonconforming was one of the following: annexation into the town, adoption of subpart B of this Code or a previous zoning ordinance, or amendment of subpart B of this Code or a previous zoning ordinance. 
(3)  The nonconforming use has been operating since the time that the use first became nonconforming without abandonment, as abandonment is defined in subsection (d) of this section. 
(b)  Expansion. 
(1)  No nonconforming use may be expanded or increased beyond the lot or tract upon which such nonconforming use is located as of the effective date of subpart B of this Code, except to provide off-street loading or off-street parking space upon approval of the board of adjustment. 
(2)  No structure, occupied by a nonconforming use shall be altered so as to increase the gross floor area. 
(3)  No nonconforming structure shall be altered or expanded so as to increase the degree of nonconformity. 
(c)  Change of use. 
(1)  Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use, and once such change is made, the use shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
(2)  Where a conforming use is located in a nonconforming structure, the use may be changed to another conforming use by securing a certificate of occupancy. 
(d)  Abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use is abandoned, all nonconforming rights shall cease, and the use of the premises shall henceforth be in conformance to subpart B of this Code. Abandonment shall involve the intent of the user or owner to discontinue a nonconforming operation and the actual act of discontinuance. Any nonconforming use that is discontinued, or that remains vacant for a period of six months, shall be considered to have been abandoned. Any nonconforming use that is moved from the premises shall be considered to have been abandoned.

Sec. 82-71. - Purpose of article. 
The purpose of this article is to require off-street parking and loading facilities in proportion to the parking demand for each use in order to ensure functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing and secure off-street parking and loading facilities. The regulations and design standards of this article are intended to accomplish the following: 
(1)  To ensure the usefulness of parking and loading facilities. 
(2)  To ensure sufficient parking spaces on-site in order to prevent inappropriate parking on public streets and in residential neighborhoods. 
(3)  To ensure that developments are not designed with excessive parking. 
(4)  To ensure that access to parking and loading facilities does not impair the function of adjacent roadways or endanger the public safety. 
(Code 1989, ch. 12, § 5.02(a); Ord. No. 62-04, § 2, 7-19-2004)  
Sec. 82-72. - Applicability of article provisions. 
(a)  New and complying development. New development occurring after June 6, 1994, and development existing on June 6, 1994, and complying with the number of off-street parking and loading spaces required by this article, shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Every use of a building or land hereafter established shall provide the minimum off-street parking and loading spaces as required by this article. The adequate provision of parking spaces will be reviewed during rezoning, specific use permit (SUP), site plan and certificate of occupancy approvals. 
(2)  The number of parking and loading spaces may be reduced when the land use or floor area of a building is changed or reduced to a use or floor area for which fewer parking or loading spaces are required. 
(3)  When a building is expanded or a land use is changed so as to increase the number of parking or loading spaces required, the number of such spaces shall be increased. 
(b)  Existing noncomplying development. Developments with noncomplying parking and loading areas shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Existing parking and loading spaces shall not be reduced below the minimum required by this article. 
(2)  No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any new building, building addition or expansion, change of use, remodeling or structural alterations until all of the parking and loading areas associated with the development are brought into full conformity with all of the provisions of this article. 
(Code 1989, ch. 12, § 5.02(b); Ord. No. 62-04, § 3, 7-19-2004)  
Sec. 82-73. - Computing parking and loading requirements. 
The number of parking spaces required for a specific development proposal shall be based on the requirements listed in section 82-74, Off-street parking and loading space requirements, and the following provisions: 
(1)  Deviation of required spaces. The amount of parking can be reduced or increased by 20 percent. Deviations in excess of 20 percent must be accompanied by a parking study and approved by the town council. Any approved parking in excess of 20 percent must be mitigated. Mitigation can be achieved by the use of pervious paving, increased landscaping, increased stormwater treatment, or other method to reduce the impact of the increased parking. 
(2)  Unlisted uses. Where questions arise concerning the minimum off-street parking and loading requirements for any use not specifically listed, the requirements may be interpreted by the town as those of a similar use. 
(3)  Large developments. A large development is defined as any development that is required to provide over 250 parking spaces based on the parking ratios listed in section 82-74. All large developments are required to provide a parking study as defined in this section and should provide a minimum reduction of 20 percent from the sum of the specific parking required for each use. 
(4)  Parking study. A parking study required by this article shall be reviewed by the town along with any traffic engineering and planning data that are appropriate to the establishment of a parking requirement for the use proposed. A parking study, when required by this article, shall include, but not be limited to, estimates of parking requirements based on recommendations in studies such as those from the Urban Land Institute, the Institute of Traffic Engineers, or the Traffic Institute, and based on data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use. Comparability shall be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. The analysis must include a shared parking analysis based on the mixture of uses and corresponding peak demand. Specifically, the parking required for restaurants should be included in the study and be determined by the number, location, and type of restaurants proposed. The study shall document the source of data used to develop recommendations. 
(5)  Location. All required parking shall be located and arranged on the site to insure optimal access and use. 
(6)  Fractions. When measurements determining the number of required parking and loading spaces result in fractions, any fraction less than one-half shall be disregarded and any fraction of one-half or more shall be rounded upward to the next highest full number. 
(7)  Seating capacity. Where parking ratios are specified in terms of the number of seats, this shall be interpreted to mean maximum seating capacity as determined using the standards of the uniform building code. 
(8)  Floor area. Floor area of structures devoted to off-street parking of vehicles shall be excluded in computing the off-street parking and loading requirements of any use.

(f)  Additional requirements. The town council may, in the interest of the public welfare and to ensure compliance with this section and the urban design criteria, establish conditions of operation, location, arrangement, proportionality scale, materials and construction of any use for which a permit is authorized.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 90-31. - Purpose and applicability of article provisions. 
A development plan shall be submitted and approved prior to the submittal of a record plat whenever a subdivision of five or more lots is proposed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a development plan is not required prior to the submittal of a record plat for a nonresidential subdivision that is being record platted in conformity to a concept plan previously approved by the town council. The development plan is intended to show all the planning factors necessary to enable the proper town approving authorities to determine whether the proposed plan for land development is satisfactory from the standpoint of public health, safety and welfare and is in accordance with the general guidance provided by the comprehensive master plan. The development plan and its review are intended to produce a subdivision design in which all planning factors have been recognized and reconciled, as distinguished from the record plat, in which the engineering factor of dimensional precision is the predominant objective. The record plat is the legal document filed of record with the county.

(a)  Items for consideration. The planning and zoning commission shall, in its action on the development plan, consider the physical arrangement of the subdivision, including the alignment and configuration of street and thoroughfare rights-of-way and determine compliance with the land use plan, thoroughfare plan, and any other applicable provisions of the comprehensive master plan, taking into consideration the recommendations of town staff. The planning and zoning commission shall also review and recommend that appropriate easements for proposed or future utility service and surface drainage are provided, and that the lot size and area comply with the minimum requirements for the type of sanitary sewage disposal proposed. Where connection to an approved sanitary sewage collection and treatment system is not proposed, all lots and building sites shall contain a minimum area of two acres, unless otherwise approved based upon studies of the particular soil conditions and evaluation of the topographic and geologic character of the area being subdivided. 
(b)  Action. Following review of the development plan and other materials submitted for conformity to the regulations of this article, including changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider, the planning and zoning commission shall act thereon as submitted or modified, and, if approved, the planning and zoning commission shall express its approval as conditional approval and state the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefor.

Sec. 90-58. - Preliminary grading release; bonding. 
Upon approval of construction plans, but prior to approval of the record plat, right-of-way and lot grading may commence; provided, however, that such grading does not authorize any utility-related construction. Any such right-of-way and/or lot grading conducted prior to the approval of the record plat shall be entirely at the sole option and risk of the owner/developer. Such optional right-of-way or lot grading shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Submission of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP); 
(2)  Submission of a copy of the application to the EPA of a notice of intent (NOI) to begin lot grading; 
(3)  Submission of grading plans to be approved by the director of public works; and 
(4)  Submission of a restoration bond to the town in the amount of $1,000.00 per acre that is valid for a period of one year. The purpose of such bond is to provide the town with a mechanism to restore proper grading and vegetation to the job site if the developer/owner fails to complete the subdivision improvements after initial clearing has occurred. The town reserves the right to call the bond at any point during the one-year period that it appears the job site has been abandoned, the contractor fails to respond to written notice, and the time limits for maintaining or proceeding with such construction activity are in violation of EPA requirements. The bond shall be returned subsequent to the filing of a record plat for the subdivision.

A completed application for a record plat, meeting all the requirements of section 90-93, shall be submitted to the executive director of development services at least 45 days prior to the meeting at which consideration is desired. The official date of the record plat, and the date on which it shall be considered administratively complete, shall be the date upon which the record plat is determined to be in compliance with the general and administrative provisions of this chapter, by the executive director of development services, or the date upon which the construction plans are found to be in full compliance with this chapter's standards, by the director of public works, whichever occurs later. The record plat will then be scheduled for consideration on the first available planning and zoning commission agenda as determined by the date of acceptance for review and the calendar schedule as maintained by the executive director of development services.

The planning and zoning commission shall act on the record plat within 30 days after the official filing date, unless such time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. If no action is taken by the planning and zoning commission within 30 days after the official filing date or such longer period as may have been agreed upon, the record plat shall be deemed approved. A certificate showing the official date and failure to take action thereon within 30 days of such date shall, on demand, be issued by the planning and zoning commission, and this certificate shall be sufficient in lieu of a written endorsement or other evidence of approval. 
(b)  Review. A subdivider may obtain approval of a section or phase of a subdivision, provided that the application conforms to the phasing indicated on the development plan and meets all the requirements of this subpart B with reference to such section or phase in the same manner as is required for a complete subdivision. If a subdivision and its record plat is approved by the planning and zoning commission in sections or phases, each record plat of each section is to carry the name of the entire subdivision, but is to bear a distinguishing letter, number or subpart. Block numbers shall run consecutively throughout the entire subdivision, even though such subdivision may be finally approved in sections or phases. 
(c)  Approval. 
(1)  After the planning and zoning commission has determined that the record plat is in proper form, that the arrangement of the development proposed for the property being subdivided is consistent with zoning regulations and that the subdivision complies with the provisions of this subpart B and is in conformance with the development plan, it shall act to approve the record plat. 
(2)  If the planning and zoning commission determines that the record plat is in proper form, that the arrangement of the development proposed for the property being subdivided is consistent with zoning regulations and that the subdivision complies with the provisions of this subpart B, but is not in conformance with the development plan, it shall forward the record plat to the town council with a recommendation to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove such plat. 
(d)  Disapproval. Record plats that are disapproved by the planning and zoning commission shall be returned to the subdivider by the executive director of development services with an attached statement of the reasons for such action.

Sec. 90-445. - Payment of cash in lieu of dedication. 
Payment of cash in lieu of the dedication of land for park and recreational purposes shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Applicability. Unless otherwise recommended by the parks board, in any case in which the land required to be dedicated by this division would be less than one acre, and in all cases in which the town council determines, upon recommendation of the parks board, that the park and recreational needs of a proposed development would be better served by a park in a different location or the expansion or improvement of an existing park or recreational area, the developer or subdivider shall pay to the town a sum of money that is equal to the fair market value of the parkland otherwise required for dedication as set forth in section 90-443(d). In addition, for any existing lots replatted in accordance with the requirements set forth in division 3 of article III of this chapter that results in the creation of additional lots, such park dedication fees in lieu of dedication per residential lot shall be paid to the town for each lot for which cash in lieu of dedication fee has not previously been paid. 
(2)  Calculation of fee. The amount of the fee in lieu of dedication shall be calculated as follows: The town shall calculate the average estimated fair market value per acre of the land being subdivided at the time of development plan approval. Evidence of comparable sales in the area may be provided by the developer or subdivider in calculating the amount of the fee in lieu of dedication. The per acre fair market value shall be multiplied by the amount of land otherwise to be dedicated as stipulated in section 90-443(d).

If a pending request for a minor change or deviation, when taken together with the development's prior minor changes, would constitute a major change in the opinion of the director of planning services, the requested minor change or deviation shall be processed as a major change necessitating an amendment to the zoning ordinance governing the development. 
(4)  Major changes to the approved open space plan include any of the following: 
a.  Elimination of trail connectivity shown on the approved plans. 
b.  Any changes to the development standards for open space that were approved with the ordinance establishing the zoning district. 
c.  Any reductions in excess of ten percent in any one of the open space type areas in any phase of the development that was approved as part of the open space plan.

ARTICLE I. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 94-1. - Purpose. 
The terms and provisions of this chapter are intended to accomplish the following public purposes: 
(1)  Establish rules and regulations for the protection and preservation of native and/or established trees within the town. 
(2)  Encourage the preservation and replacement of the town's tree canopy by establishing a 35 percent canopy goal for the town as outlined in guidelines established by "American Forests," the nation's oldest nonprofit citizens' conservation organization. 
(3)  Encourage the protection of healthy trees and provide for the replacement and/or replanting of trees that are necessarily removed during construction, development or redevelopment. 
(4)  Provide for the preservation and protection of larger native and/or established trees, which provide a valuable amenity to the urban environment and which, once destroyed, can only be replaced after generations, if at all. 
(5)  Provide for shade, windbreaks and the cooling of air; thereby, reducing the requirements for air conditioning and heating and the utilization of scarce energy sources. 
(6)  Provide for open space and more efficient drainage of land; thereby, reducing the effects of soil erosion and the need for additional drainage facilities. 
(7)  Reduce the clear-cutting of land. 
(8)  Preserve the country atmosphere and natural environment that define the community character of the town and make it a unique and desirable community. 
(9)  Mitigate the ill effects of rapid and intense urbanization. 
(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-1), 10-6-2008)  
Sec. 94-2. - Applicability of chapter provisions. 
The terms and provisions of this chapter shall apply to real property within the town's corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction as follows: 
(1)  All real property upon which any protected, specimen, or historic tree is located, excluding property that has already been developed for single-family and two-family residential uses. 
(2)  All vacant and undeveloped real property. 
(3)  All real property to be subdivided or re-subdivided, including record plats and replats. 
(4)  The yard areas of all developed property, excluding property already developed for single-family and two-family residential uses. 
(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-2), 10-6-2008)  
Secs. 94-394-12. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE II. - MEASUREMENT 
 
Sec. 94-13. - Landscape, nursery, or replacement trees. 
Unless specified otherwise, tree caliper (diameter) or circumference shall be measured at a height of 12 inches above ground level. The caliper of multi-trunk trees shall be measured by determining the diameter or circumference of the largest trunk at full caliper added to one-half of the diameter or circumference of each remaining trunk, measured at a height of 12 inches above ground level. 
(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-3), 10-6-2008)  
Sec. 94-14. - Existing, established, and/or native trees. 
The caliper or circumference of existing, established, and/or native trees shall be measured in accordance with the measuring rules and procedures as developed and updated by the Texas Forest Service. A copy of these procedures shall be made available for review in the office of the tree preservation and enforcement officer. The current procedure is outlined below. 
(1)  Caliper width or circumference. 
General rule: Measure the smallest trunk caliper width or circumference between the diameter at breast height ("DBH") point (4.5 feet) and the ground, but below the lowest fork. Also record the height above the ground, in inches, where the measurement was taken. 
(2)  Determining DBH point. 
Tree on slope: Measure up 4.5 feet along the axis of the trunk on both the high and low sides of the trunk; DBH point is midway between these two planes. 
Leaning tree: Measure 4.5 feet along both the top and under sides of the trunk; DBH point is midway between these two planes. 
Low branches: When determining where on the trunk to measure circumference, ignore portions of the tree that do not form part of the tree's crown, such as dead branches or forks, and epicormic sprouts. 
Obstruction at DBH: If there is a bump, burl, branch, or other obstruction at the DBH point, measure the circumference of the trunk above and below the obstruction and record the smaller value. A buttress that forms between the trunk and root system as a natural feature of the species (e.g.bald cypress, water tupelo) should not be considered an obstruction. 
(3)  Multiple trees. In practice, it must be determined whether a tree has a single trunk, or whether it represents two or more stems growing very close to one another. Trunks that have clear separation or included bark at or near the ground line should be considered separate trees; trunks of different species should also be considered separate stems, no matter how closely aligned. When following the measurement rules above, if the point below the lowest fork places the measurement at the ground line, the stems should be considered and measured as separate.

ARTICLE III. - PRESERVATION 
 
Sec. 94-21. - Tree designations. 
Protected, specimen, and historic trees, except as specified in this section, shall possess the following respective characteristics or criteria: 
(1)  Protected trees. Any tree listed on the small, medium, or large protected tree lists in section 94-22 that measures six inches in caliper width or greater and which is at least ten feet in height and located outside of existing public streets, alleys, rights-of-way, utility easements, drainage easements, fence easements, pedestrian access easements, or other existing public rights-of-way or easements. 
(2)  Specimen tree. Except as specified in this section, any tree listed on the town's small, medium, or large protected tree lists can be considered a specimen tree if it reaches the designated size for that list. For the small tree list, a specimen tree shall be any tree that measures 13 inches or more in caliper width. For the medium tree list, a specimen tree shall be any tree that measures 19 inches or more in caliper width. For the large tree list, a specimen tree shall be any tree that measures 25 inches or more in caliper width. All measurements shall be taken in accordance with the measuring rules and procedures as outlined and maintained by the Texas Forest Service. These procedures are outlined in section 94-14 of this chapter. In addition to the provisions of this subsection, a specimen tree shall be any other tree that has been designated by the town council, upon recommendation by the environmental conservation commission, after public hearing and due notice to the owner of the tree, to be of high value because of its type, size, age or other relevant criteria. Specimen trees shall not be regulated as protected trees. Specific requirements are set forth in this chapter regarding specimen trees. 
Post oak trees shall receive a separate designation and specimen size classification of 22 inches or more in caliper width as listed within section 94-22. 
(3)  Historic tree. Upon recommendation by the environmental conservation commission, a historic tree shall be any tree that has been designated by the town council, after public hearing and due notice to the owner of the tree, as a tree of notable historical interest and value to the town because of its location or historical association with the community. A listing and map of all designated historic trees shall be maintained and updated by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee and made available to the public upon request. Historic trees are not dependant on or determined by diameter or caliper width as are protected and specimen trees. Specific requirements are set forth in this chapter regarding historic trees. 
Subject to the review and approval of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, a protected or specimen tree shall not include any living tree that a registered arborist or landscape architect certifies in writing is injured, dying, diseased or infested with harmful insects; that is in danger of falling, interferes with utility service or creates unsafe vision clearance; in any manner creates a hazardous or dangerous condition so as to endanger the public health, welfare or safety. Further, a protected tree shall not include any living tree that is identified on approved subdivision construction plans as necessary to be removed to comply with EPA storm water permitting requirements or FHA lot grading plans. 
Subject to review and approval of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, a protected, specimen, or historic tree shall not include any tree that a registered arborist or landscape architect certifies in writing is dead.

(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-12), 10-6-2008)  
Sec. 94-35. - Tree removal permit on property zoned agricultural district (A) uses. 
No fee shall be charged to make application for a tree removal permit for the removal of protected trees located on real property having an agricultural zoning district classification. However, if within any 12-month period, tree removal permits for the removal of 20 or more protected trees are issued for the same agricultural property or tract, or any of its portions, the agricultural zoning district classification of such property cannot be changed, nor can an application for approval of a development plan, planned development or zoning amendment relative to such property be made, for a period of 60 months following the most recent 12-month period during which 20 or more protected trees were removed from such agricultural zoned property. 
(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-13), 10-6-2008)  
Sec. 94-36. - Special provisions for agricultural district (A) uses. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, for tracts zoned agricultural district (A) uses, the tree survey requirements contained in this article shall be limited in their application to proposed rights-of-way, easements and an area equal to 20 feet on any side of such rights-of-way and easements, provided that the applicant executes a development agreement with the town that all trees on the tract and outside of such areas, for the purposes of such agreement, are protected trees (regardless of their species or caliper width) and that the unauthorized removal of such trees shall result in the revocation of any previously approved development plan and record plat for a period of 60 months from the date of the most recent unauthorized removal of one or more trees from the subject property. 
(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-14), 10-6-2008)  
Sec. 94-37. - Review of application. 
(a)  An application for a tree removal permit for a protected tree located outside of the buildable area shall be accompanied by an administrative fee per tree proposed for removal in the amount listed in appendix A of this Code, not to exceed a total per permit application in an amount listed in appendix A of this Code. An application for a tree removal permit for a specimen tree, or historic tree shall be accompanied by an administrative fee per tree proposed for removal in the amount listed in appendix A of this Code. Upon receipt of a properly completed application accompanied by the appropriate fee, the tree preservation and enforcement officer or his authorized designee shall review the application and may conduct field inspections of the development and/or refer the permit application to other departments for review and recommendations as deemed necessary and appropriate by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or his authorized designee. 
(b)  The application for a tree removal permit, if required, shall be considered an integral part of the application for development plan or site plan approval, or the application for an oil and gas well permit. No development plan or site plan for any development, or oil and gas well permit, subject to the terms and provisions of this subdivision, shall be approved without approval of such tree removal permit. It is further provided that if a property owner or developer does not submit a tree removal permit application prior to town approval of a development plan covering a particular site, then if a tree removal permit application for the site is submitted later, approval of the development plan may be revoked. In this event, a revised development plan must be submitted for review by the town. 
(c)  The tree preservation and enforcement officer may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request for a tree removal permit for protected trees located outside the buildable area of a lot or site, provided that the requested tree removal permit is for the removal of trees in a development district other than the Cross Timbers Conservation Development District. An appeal of the decision of the tree preservation and enforcement officer may be made to the Environmental Conservation Commission. 
(d)  An application for a tree removal permit for specimen, historic, or protected trees located outside the buildable area of a lot or site within the Cross Timbers Conservation Development District or an application for a tree removal permit for specimen, or historic trees within all other districts shall be submitted to the environmental conservation commission for review and recommendation to the town council that the permit application be approved, approved with conditions or denied. The environmental conservation commission shall not recommend an application for a tree removal permit be approved or approved with conditions, unless the commission finds that the subject development, redevelopment, subdivision or re-subdivision cannot reasonably be developed, based on economic and/or practical considerations, without removal of the trees included in the permit application. 
(e)  The environmental conservation commission's recommendation concerning an application for tree removal permit shall be reviewed by the town council. The town council may then approve the application, approve it with conditions, or deny the application; however, the town council may overturn the denial of an application for tree removal permit by the environmental conservation commission only upon a finding that the subject development, redevelopment, subdivision or re-subdivision cannot reasonably be developed, based on economic and/or practical considerations, without removal of the trees included in the permit application. 
(f)  Approval for removal of a historic tree shall require a three-fourths majority vote of the environmental conservation commission and the town council, respectively. 
(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-15), 10-6-2008)  
Sec. 94-38. - Per-caliper-inch cash value; replacement trees; mitigation fee credit. 
(a)  A per-caliper-inch cash value for replacement trees shall be set, and updated as necessary by the town council after review and recommendation by the environmental conservation commission. The per-caliper-inch cash value shall be used to calculate mitigation costs for authorized and unauthorized removals of protected, specimen, and historic trees. The tree preservation and enforcement officer or his authorized designee shall maintain a record of the current per-caliper-inch cash value of replacement trees. 
(b)  Whenever a mitigation fee is imposed in accordance with this chapter, a mitigation fee credit will be given for replacement tree(s), that are at least two inches in diameter at the point on the trunk four and one-half feet above ground, planted on the property for which the tree mitigation fee was assessed or property mutually agreed upon by the town and the person. The calculation for the credit will be done in the same manner as the tree mitigation fee assessed against the person and be:

Sec. 94-39. - Mitigation requirements for authorized tree removal. 
(a)  Replacement trees required for the removal of protected trees located within the buildable area on a lot or site. It shall be the responsibility of any person removing a protected tree located within the buildable area of a lot or site to replace each protected tree removed with one, two and one-half to three-inch caliper tree measured in accordance with section 94-13 of this chapter. Replacement trees shall be of a species listed on the town's approved mitigation and replacement tree planting list. Replacement trees shall have a minimum height of at least six feet, and shall be planted in locations approved by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee. Acceptable locations shall include reforestation sites designated by the town. At the discretion of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, money in an amount equal to the per-caliper-inch cash value of the removed tree(s) may be paid to the town instead of providing the replacement trees required by this article. Any such payments shall be deposited in a special account or fund and used by the town to provide and/or support supplemental landscape plantings in public areas of the town and/or to support the administration and enforcement of the town's tree preservation regulations. A per-caliper-inch cash value for replacement trees shall be set by the town council in accordance with section 94-38 of this article. 
(b)  Mitigation of loss of habitat . When any person seeks to develop property, rezone property, or amend the master plan regarding property, so that an application for a development plan, site plan, record plat, re-plat, oil and gas well drilling permit, oil and gas pipeline permit, tree removal permit, or tree transplanting permit is required by this chapter, and such person wishes to remove protected trees from an environmentally sensitive area (ESA), such as upland habitat and/or riparian habitat as defined in the town's SMARTGrowth Program and Analysis Manual, it shall be the responsibility of such person to mitigate the acreage of habitat lost or negatively impacted through either the payment to the town of mitigation fees or the planting of replacement trees included in the required environmental protection plan (EPP) for the development project, or a combination thereof that results in the required mitigation. This required habitat mitigation only applies to impacts to designated upland or riparian habitats. The mitigation for the removal of protected trees located outside of the designated habitats as established in an approved EPP is addressed in section 94-39(a). The monetary value of upland habitat and riparian habitat is set at $15,000.00 per acre. Preservation incentives for upland and/or riparian habitat preserved within a project are established in section 94-40. At the discretion of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, money in an amount equal to the value of the removed habitat may be paid to the town instead of providing the replacement trees. Any such payments shall be deposited in a special account or fund and used by the town to provide and/or support supplemental landscape plantings in public areas of the town and/or to support the administration and enforcement of the town's tree preservation regulations. 
(c)  Replacement trees required for the removal of protected trees located outside the buildable area on a lot or site. It shall be the responsibility of any person obtaining a tree removal permit for a protected tree located outside of the buildable area on a lot or site to provide replacement with trees having a total caliper width equivalent to one and one-half times that of the tree(s) to be removed. Total caliper width for replacement trees shall be calculated using measurements taken in accordance with section 94-14 of this chapter. For example, if a ten-inch protected tree is removed, then that tree must be replaced by trees having a total caliper width of 15 inches. This total caliper width could be satisfied by an approved combination of replacement trees to meet the required caliper width replacement. Replacement trees shall be of a species listed on the town's approved mitigation and replacement tree planting list. Such replacement trees shall be container-grown and each replacement tree shall have a minimum caliper width of two and one-half inches to three inches, measured in accordance with section 94-13 of this chapter. Replacement trees shall have a minimum height of at least six feet, and shall be planted in locations approved by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or his authorized designee. Acceptable locations shall include reforestation sites designated by the town. At the discretion of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, money in an amount equal to the per-caliper-inch cash value of the removed tree(s) may be paid to the town instead of providing the replacement trees required by this article. Any such payments shall be deposited in a special account or fund and used by the town to provide and/or support supplemental landscape plantings in public areas of the town and/or to support the administration and enforcement of the town's tree preservation regulations. A per-caliper-inch cash value for replacement trees shall be set by the town council in accordance to section 94-38 of this chapter. 
(d)  Replacement trees required for the authorized removal of specimen trees. It shall be the responsibility of any person obtaining a tree removal permit for a specimen tree to provide replacement trees having a total caliper width equivalent to two times that of the tree(s) to be removed. Total caliper width for replacement trees shall be calculated using measurements taken in accordance with section 94-14 of this chapter. Replacement trees shall be of a species listed on the town's approved mitigation and replacement tree planting list. Such replacement trees shall be container-grown and have a minimum caliper width of two and one-half inches to three inches, measured in accordance with section 94-13 of this chapter. Replacement trees shall have a minimum height of at least six feet, and shall be planted in a location approved by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee. Acceptable locations shall include reforestation sites designated by the town. At the discretion of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, money in an amount equal to the per-caliper-inch cash value of the removed tree(s) may be paid to the town instead of providing the replacement trees required by this article. Any such payments shall be deposited in a special account or fund and used by the town to provide and/or support supplemental landscape plantings in public areas of the town and/or to support the administration and enforcement of the town's tree preservation regulations. A per-caliper-inch cash value for replacement trees shall be set by the town council in accordance to section 94-38 of this chapter. 
(e)  Replacement trees required for the authorized removal of historic trees. It shall be the responsibility of any person obtaining a tree removal permit for a historic tree to provide replacement trees having a total caliper width equivalent to two and one-half times that of the tree(s) to be removed. Total caliper width for replacement trees shall be calculated using measurements taken in accordance with section 94-14 of this chapter. Replacement trees shall be of a species listed on the town's approved mitigation and replacement tree planting list. Such replacement trees shall be container-grown and have a minimum caliper width of two and one-half inches to three inches, measured in accordance with section 94-13 of this chapter. Replacement trees shall have a minimum height of at least six feet, and shall be planted in locations as approved by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee. Acceptable locations shall include reforestation sites designated by the town. At the discretion of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, money in an amount equal to the per-caliper-inch cash value of the removed tree(s) may be paid to the town instead of providing the replacement trees required by this article. Any such payments shall be deposited in a special account or fund and used by the town to provide and/or support supplemental landscape plantings in public areas of the town and/or to support the administration and enforcement of the town's tree preservation regulations. A per-caliper-inch cash value for replacement trees shall be set by the town council in accordance to section 94-38 of this chapter. 
Any fees or payments made to the town to satisfy the mitigation or replacement requirements of this article shall be paid at the time of a preconstruction meeting authorizing grading or construction activities to occur on the lot or site. In cases where a preconstruction meeting is not required, all fees or payments shall be made prior to the issuance of a building permit for the lot or site.

Sec. 94-40. - Incentives for preservation of protected, specimen, and historic trees. 
If any protected, specimen, or historic tree is preserved within an area that would otherwise be considered a buildable area, credit for preservation shall be given that will be counted toward the mitigation requirements for the removal of protected trees within the buildable area on a site or project. Such mitigation credits shall be given only for those trees whose critical root zones are left predominately in their natural state. No cutting, filling, or other construction related activities are allowed within the critical root zones of trees eligible for mitigation credit unless otherwise approved in writing and in advance by the town. Existing trees that are preserved within required street yard landscaping areas shall be counted for credit toward the requirements of section 82-241 of this Code, street yard landscaping, provided that they are located within the street yard and/or parking area. Following is a list of credits available for the preservation of protected and specimen trees on a site or project, and a separate credit schedule for the preservation of protected and specimen post oak trees on a site or project. 
(1)  One mitigation tree credit will be given for each protected tree preserved within a buildable area on a site or project. 
(2)  The following schedule outlines tree credits that will be given for each specimen tree preserved within a buildable area on a site or project.

(4)  Mitigation credits for preservation of protected trees within designated upland and/or riparian habitat will be given for each acre of habitat protected on a site or project. 
(5)  For purposes of this section, one mitigation tree credit shall be the equivalent of the person developing the property providing one container-grown tree as provided in section 94-39 of a variety selected from the replacement tree list having a minimum caliper width of two and one-half inches to three inches, measured in accordance with section 94-13 of this chapter. In the event the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee approves the payment of money in an amount equal to the per-caliper-inch cash value of the removed tree(s) instead of providing the replacement trees required by this article, one mitigation tree credit shall be the equivalent of the per-caliper-inch cash value for a replacement tree having a minimum caliper width of two and one-half inches to three inches. However, no tree credits shall be allowed or permitted for trees that are dead, dying, diseased or infested with harmful insects (as determined by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee), or for trees which have not been adequately protected using required tree protection measures, as defined in article V of this chapter, or which are otherwise likely to die (as determined by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee); or trees that are not included on the protected tree list. 
(Ord. No. 63-08, § 3(94-18), 10-6-2008; Ord. No. 62-16 , § 7, 11-21-2016)  
Sec. 94-41. - Penalties for unauthorized removal of protected, specimen, and historic trees. 
If any protected, specimen, or historic trees are removed from any real property without a tree removal permit, or if a protected, specimen, or historic tree is injured because of failure to follow required tree protection measures such that the tree dies or may reasonably be expected to die, the town shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following administrative and civil penalties on the developer and/or owner of the property: 
(1)  A monetary penalty of $250.00 per-caliper-inch of width of the protected tree(s) removed or damaged, payable to the town. A monetary penalty of $500.00 per-caliper-inch of width of the specimen tree(s) removed or damaged, payable to the town. A monetary penalty of $750.00 per-caliper-inch of width of the historic tree(s) removed or damaged, payable to the town. Funds paid to the town as tree removal penalties shall be deposited in a special account or fund and used by the town to provide and/or support supplemental landscape plantings in public areas of the town, and/or to support the administration and enforcement of the town's tree preservation regulations. 
(2)  For each protected tree that is removed or damaged, replacement with new trees having a total tree caliper width equivalent to five times that of the removed or damaged tree(s). For each specimen tree that is removed or damaged, replacement with new trees having a total tree caliper width equivalent to ten times that of the removed or damaged tree(s). For each historic tree that is removed or damaged, replacement with new trees having a total tree caliper width equivalent to 15 times that of the removed or damaged tree(s). Replacement trees shall be of a species listed on the town's approved mitigation and replacement tree planting list. Such replacement trees shall be container-grown and have a minimum caliper width of two and one-half inches to three inches, measured in accordance with section 94-13 of this chapter. Replacement trees shall have a minimum height of at least six feet, and shall be planted in locations as approved by the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee. Acceptable locations shall include reforestation sites designated by the town. At the discretion of the tree preservation and enforcement officer or authorized designee, money in an amount equal to the per-caliper-inch cash value of the removed or damaged tree(s) may be paid to the town instead of providing replacement trees required by this article. Any such payments shall be deposited in a special account or fund and used by the town to provide and/or support supplemental landscape plantings in public areas of the town and/or to support the administration and enforcement of the town's tree preservation regulations. A per-caliper-inch cash value for replacement trees shall be set by the town council in accordance with section 94-38 of this article.

(a)  The SMARTGrowth analysis referenced herein shall not be applicable to minor plats, amended plats, replats that do not increase density, or for institutional or civic uses. 
(b)  Rough proportionality. In the event that a situation arises that places SMARTGrowth in conflict with state or federal law, the town may recognize that the development exactions (land dedication, payment of fees other than impact fees, and construction of facilities and infrastructure) required to satisfy the town's SMARTGrowth program assuring the provision of adequate public facilities may in certain circumstances be limited by the restrictions of rough proportionality as announced by the Texas Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court and adopted, in part at least, by the Texas Legislature in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, § 212.904 and allow for SMARTGrowth approval in those particular circumstances. 
(Ord. No. 41-02, § 3.01.1(d)2., 7-15-2002; Ord. No. 11-10 § 6, 2-15-2010)  
Sec. 98-73. - Criteria; purpose and objectives. 
SMARTGrowth criteria effectuate the community vision and values embodied in the Flower Mound Master Plan by translating them into constitutive development criteria to evaluate the community-wide impacts of development applications and projects for the purpose of ensuring that development occurs in a manner that contributes to the accomplishment of community character and quality of life objectives. There are three general types of SMARTGrowth criteria used in the SMARTGrowth program: 
(a)  Performance-based criteria relative to the adequacy of public service levels. 
(b)  Per unit of population criteria relative to the adequacy of public facilities. 
(c)  Values-based, qualitative criteria relative to community character and quality of life objectives. 
The SMARTGrowth criteria have also been grouped into six general categories, as follows: adequate public infrastructure, adequate public facilities, adequate public services, economic development, environmental quality, and community character. 
(Ord. No. 41-02, § 3.01.1(d)3., 7-15-2002)  
Sec. 98-74. - Evaluation. 
(a)  In applying the SMARTGrowth criteria to a specific development application or project, a "pass-fail" evaluation will be utilized to determine compliance with applicable criteria. In other words, for a development application or project to attain compliance with the SMARTGrowth program (ensuring that it contributes to community character and quality of life objectives), it must be evaluated as "passing" or complying with each applicable SMARTGrowth criterion. Otherwise, it will "fail" and be denied until such time as compliance is or can be attained. 
(b)  For analysis of large multi-phase projects over 100 acres in area, the evaluation will include a development agreement that captures the timing of the infrastructure construction and phasing. With this information, up-front modeling and planning for build-out of the entire development can be included in the water and wastewater models, with a check for adequacy of the existing infrastructure. If there exists an inadequacy of the existing infrastructure, the phasing and timing of construction of the additional infrastructure required will be addressed in the development agreement. Modeling updates for the current and next two years of development in accordance with the phasing plan provided by the developer will be included with the initial application. Each subsequent site plan or final plat will include model updates. 
(c)  With 2009 updates to the water master plan and wastewater master plan, and associated town-wide models, a hybrid approach to include model updates will be implemented. This effort will provide a link between SMARTGrowth results and our capital improvement projects planning and may provide a transition to a more streamlined evaluation approach.

c.  Significant stands of native trees and any other areas of substantial vegetation shall be preserved and protected from alteration or destruction, unless a mitigation plan is approved in conjunction with the concept or development plan for the project, which proposes replacement of the trees or vegetation to be removed with equivalent vegetation or vegetation which is better suited to existing natural conditions. The establishment of new vegetative communities is encouraged. 
d.  Preservation of such areas shall be counted toward fulfillment of open space requirements subject to the following limitations: 
1.  Floodplain areas. Adjacent floodplain land may be included as project open space in conservation developments. 
2.  Other areas. Significant stands of vegetation must be incorporated in areas to be dedicated to common open space, so as to prevent fragmentation, in order to be counted toward project open space. 
(2)  Minimum project open space. Wherever an applicant requesting approval for a conservation development project elects to provide open space in order to satisfy these conservation development standards, a minimum of 50 percent of the gross land area must be preserved as open space for the project. 
(3)  Open space dedication. In meeting requirements for open space, the developer must dedicate land or convey open space to be held in a conservation easement by a qualified nonprofit entity or organization that manages open space, such as a land trust, or other qualified entity, pursuant to section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and as may be approved and accepted by the town, or a governmental entity. 
(4)  Open space allocation in phased projects. In a phased conservation development project, all open space shall be conserved in a conservation easement in conjunction with the development of the first phase of the project. 
(5)  Open space design and improvements. The design and improvements of open space shall be in accordance with the following standards. These standards may be supplemented by administrative guidelines. 
a.  Open space areas in a conservation development shall be linked to existing and planned public open space or conserved areas to provide an overall open space system wherever possible. 
b.  Where feasible, and where compatible with and depending upon the values and uses of the conserved land, open space areas shall be arranged so as to maximize access and utilization by residents of the conservation development project. 
(e)  Project design. 
(1)  It is the intent of the regulations of this section to encourage outstanding project design for conservation development projects in order to implement the policies contained in the town's comprehensive plan. The town recognizes that project design is an important and variable element in implementing comprehensive plan policies relating to conservation developments and overall community objectives. It is the town's intent to promulgate administrative guidelines to illustrate preferred design methods. It is acknowledged that other design alternatives may be superior for a particular project. The following standards will be used to evaluate project design: 
a.  The arrangement of all uses and improvements should reflect the natural capabilities and limitations of the site as well as the characteristics and limitations of adjacent property. 
b.  Development must be compatible with the immediate environment of the site and neighborhood relative to existing adjacent residential densities unless otherwise buffered in an acceptable manner; scale, bulk and building height; historical character; and disposition and orientation of buildings on the lot. 
c.  Buildings, roadways, open space and landscaping must be designed and arranged to produce an efficient, functionally organized and cohesive development. 
d.  Buildings, roadways, open space and landscaping must be in favorable relationship to the existing natural topography, water bodies and watercourses, exposure to sunlight and wind, and view corridors and scenic vistas. 
e.  Buildings, roadways, open space and landscaping must be designed and arranged to maximize the opportunity for privacy by the residents of the project and surrounding areas. 
f.  Building sites must be located to minimize their impact on view corridors and scenic vistas. 
(2)  For any conservation development project submitted to the town for approval, a development agreement shall be entered into between the town and the developer of the conservation development project. The development agreement shall set forth specific development standards and other applicable conditions for the conservation development project; however, no development standard or other applicable condition shall be less restrictive than those contained in this section or chapter. Such development agreement shall be subject to town council approval and may be filed in the deed records of the county. 
(f)  Alternative proposals and variation from requirements. The performance standards for conservation development projects contained in this section are considered to be the minimum standards necessary for approval. It is recognized, however, that project size, location and design may necessitate a different arrangement or distribution of open space or buffers than are envisioned in the regulations of this section, and that different amenities than those specified in this section may become valuable options. Consequently, an applicant for a conservation development project may submit an alternative proposal with corresponding variations in the standards applicable to such a development, which alternative shall be evaluated and action taken thereon in accordance with the procedures contained in this chapter; provided, however, that the following limitations apply: 
(1)  No variations will be granted from the allowed residential densities for conservation development projects. 
(2)  The alternative proposal and variations requested shall achieve the same basic objectives as the particular standards which are to be varied. 
(3)  Where the proposal seeks to vary project size limitations, the alternative design shall be evaluated in accordance with standards applicable to larger projects. 
(g)  Conservation development incentives. Conservation development will be considered for conservation incentives commensurate with the quality and character of the open or natural lands to be placed within a conservation easement or otherwise conserved and the extent to which the conserved land contributes to the preservation of the Cross Timbers Conservation Development District's country character, including its open, natural, scenic and ecological values. Incentives will be considered on a project-by-project basis and will be approved by the town council only after community input and public hearing. Such incentives may include, but are not limited to: expedited development review, permit fee waivers, reduced street infrastructure requirements, as reflected in the town's thoroughfare plan, up to and including 50 percent reduction in park land dedication requirements, and reduction of monetary assessments relative to agricultural rollback taxes. The purpose of this criterion is to protect the open lands, natural landscapes and ecological resources that create and define the town's unique community character and which are essential to the accomplishment of community character, quality of life and economic development objectives.

Sec. 98-278. - Rural development option and standards. 
(1)  Purpose and definition. The purpose of this section is to provide for single-family detached development on lots of five acres or greater, which reflects the country atmosphere and natural environment of Flower Mound, as permitted under the existing agricultural zoning. This may include specialized types of development, such as equestrian-oriented developments. To encourage "rural development," incentives may be considered based on the proposed development and the preservation of open space and natural lands within the development. Subdivisions designated for "rural development" and which receive incentives, shall not be subdivided further without approval by the town. The following standards, and all conditions necessary to ensure compliance therewith, shall apply to any rural developments of one (1) five acre lot or more, in any area zoned A, agricultural district, and to all uses in that district, when approved pursuant to the rural development procedures set forth herein. 
(2)  Minimum lot area per dwelling unit. The minimum lot area per dwelling unit for a rural development project shall be five acres exclusive of all rights-of-way or easements for streets and alleys; land dedicated for public use; or park land and buffer areas, unless otherwise stated in these regulations. 
(3)  Fencing. Perimeter fencing shall be in compliance with the town's urban design plan component of the master plan relative to scenic roads, country roads, rural landscape intersections, and scenic corridors and vistas. Wood stockade and masonry perimeter fencing shall be prohibited. 
(4)  Preservation of natural features. 
(a)  All significant natural features, as defined in the open space plan and master plan, shall be preserved within the "rural development," where necessary. 
(b)  Development shall be designed and sited to preserve and protect the 100-year floodplain, consistent with applicable provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  All environmentally sensitive areas as identified by an environmental survey, which areas include upland habitat, riparian habitat, stream buffers, waters of the state, prairie habitat, and developed and undeveloped floodplain, shall be protected by inclusion in an environmental protection plan as required by the land development code. 
(5)  Alternative proposals and variation from requirements. The performance standards for rural development projects contained in this section are considered to be the minimum standards necessary for approval. It is recognized, however, that project size, location and design may necessitate a different arrangement and that different amenities than those specified herein may become valuable options. Consequently, an applicant for a rural development project may submit an alternative proposal with corresponding variations in the standards applicable to such a development, which alternative shall be evaluated and action taken thereon in accordance with the procedures contained in this chapter; provided, however, that the following limitations apply: 
(a)  No variations will be granted from the allowed minimum lot size for rural development projects. 
(b)  The alternative proposal and variations requested shall achieve the same basic objectives as the particular standards. 
(c)  Where the proposal seeks to vary project size dimensional standards, the alternative design shall be evaluated in accordance with standards applicable to larger projects. 
(6)  Rural development incentives. Rural development will be considered for incentives commensurate with the quality and character of the proposed development as it relates to the preservation of open or natural lands, including its open, natural, scenic and ecological values. Incentives will be considered on a project-by-project basis and will be approved by the town council only after community input and public hearing, except that expedited development review shall be approved administratively. Such incentives may include but are not limited to: expedited development review, permit fee waivers, reduced street infrastructure requirements, as reflected in the town's thoroughfare plan, up to and including 50 percent reduction in park land dedication requirements, and reduction of monetary assessments relative to agricultural rollback taxes. The purpose of this criterion is to preserve the open lands, natural landscapes and ecological resources that create and define Flower Mound's unique community character and which are essential to the accomplishment of community character, quality of life and economic development objectives.

Sec. 98-307. - Conservation development option and standards. 
(1)  Purpose and definition. The provisions of this section implement the goals and policies of the master plan concerning residential densities in areas zoned SF-E, single-family estate district. The following standards, and all conditions necessary to ensure compliance therewith, shall apply to any conservation developments in any areas zoned SF-E, single-family estate district, and to all uses in that district, when approved pursuant to the conservation development procedures set forth herein. "conservation development" means a residential development project in which dwelling units are clustered on smaller lots than otherwise would be allowed within tracts of land zoned SF-E, single-family estate district, for the purpose of preserving open or natural lands as an integral component of the development. Conserved lands shall be placed in a conservation easement. A "conservation easement" is defined as a voluntary and permanent deed restriction that limits the development and/or subdivision of property for the purposes of protecting conservation values in the land. The easement is a recorded restriction, applies to and binds all subsequent owners, and may be held by either (1) a nonprofit entity or organization that manages open space, such as a land trust or other qualified entity, pursuant to section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or (2) a governmental entity. 
(2)  [Minimum requirements.] 
Minimum Lot Area Per Dwelling 	Minimum Project Open Space 
15,000 square feet 	50 percent of the gross land area 
15,000 square feet with an average 20,000 square feet 	45 percent of the lot area of gross land area 
20,000 square feet 	40 percent of the gross land area 
 
The minimum lot area shall be exclusive of all rights-of-way or easements for streets and alleys; land dedicated for public use; or open space, floodplain, park land and buffer areas, unless otherwise stated in these regulations. 
(3)  Open space standards. This subsection describes standards for dedication of land for and improvement of public and private open space for conservation development projects: 
(a)  Preservation of natural features. 
1.  All significant natural features, as defined in the open space plan and master plan, shall be preserved and, where necessary, protected by setbacks from development. 
2.  Development shall be designed and sited to preserve and protect the 100-year floodplain, consistent with applicable provisions of this chapter. 
3.  Significant stands of native trees and any other areas of substantial vegetation shall be preserved and protected from alteration or destruction, unless a mitigation plan is approved in conjunction with the concept or development plan for the project, which proposes replacement of the trees or vegetation to be removed with equivalent vegetation or vegetation which is better suited to existing natural conditions. The establishment of new vegetative communities is encouraged. 
4.  Preservation of such areas shall be counted toward fulfillment of open space requirements subject to the following limitations: 
a.  Floodplain areas. Adjacent floodplain land may be included as project open space in conservation of developments; however, no credits for open space shall be given for land lying in the floodway. 
b.  Other areas. Significant stands of vegetation must be incorporated in areas to be dedicated to common open space, so as to prevent fragmentation, in order to be counted toward project open space. 
(b)  Open space dedication. In meeting requirements for open space, the developer must dedicate land or convey open space to be held in a conservation easement by (1) a qualified nonprofit entity or organization that manages open space, such as a land trust, or other qualified entity, pursuant to section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and as may be approved and accepted by the town or (2) a governmental entity. 
(c)  Open space allocation in phased projects. In a phased conservation development project, all open space shall be conserved in a conservation easement in conjunction with the development of the first phase of the project. 
(d)  Open space design and improvements. The design and improvements of open space shall be in accordance with the following standards. These standards may be supplemented by administrative guidelines. 
1.  Open space areas in a conservation development shall be linked to existing and planned open space or conserved areas to provide an overall open space system wherever possible. 
2.  Where feasible, and where compatible with and depending upon the values and uses of the conserved land, open space areas shall be arranged so as to maximize areas and utilization by residents of the conservation development project. 
(4)  Project design. 
(a)  It is the intent of these regulations to encourage outstanding project design for conservation development projects in order to implement the policies contained in the town's master plan. The town recognizes that project design is an important and variable element in implementing master plan policies relating to conservation developments and overall community objectives. It is the town's intent to promulgate administrative guidelines to illustrate preferred design methods. It is acknowledged that other design alternatives may be superior for a particular project. The following standards will be used to evaluate project design: 
1.  The arrangement of all uses and improvements should reflect the natural capabilities and limitations of the site as well as the characteristics and limitations of adjacent property. 
2.  Development must be compatible with the immediate environment of the site and neighborhood relative to existing adjacent residential densities unless otherwise buffered in an acceptable manner; scale, bulk and building height; historical character; and disposition and orientation of buildings on the lot. 
3.  Buildings, roadways, open space, and landscaping must be designed and arranged to produce an efficient, functionally organized and cohesive development. 
4.  Buildings, roadways, open space and landscaping must be in favorable relationship to the existing natural topography, water bodies and water courses, exposure to sunlight and wind, and view corridors and scenic vistas. 
5.  Buildings, roadways, open space and landscaping must be designed and arranged to maximize the opportunity for privacy by the residents of the project and surrounding areas. 
6.  Building sites must be located to minimize their impact on view corridors and scenic vistas. 
(b)  For any conservation development project submitted to the town for approval, a development agreement shall be entered into between the town and the developer of the conservation development project. The development agreement shall set forth specific development standards and other applicable conditions for the conservation development project; however, no development standard or other applicable condition shall be less restrictive than those contained in this subsection of chapter. Said development agreement shall be subject to town council approval and may be filed in the deed records of Denton County, Texas. 
(5)  Alternative proposals and variation from requirements. The performance standards for conservation development projects contained in this subsection are considered to be the minimum standards necessary for approval. It is recognized, however, that project size, location and design may necessitate a different arrangement or distribution of open space or buffers than are envisioned in these regulations, and that different amenities than those specified herein may become valuable options. Consequently, an applicant for a conservation development project may submit an alternative proposal with corresponding variations in the standards applicable to such a development, which alternative shall be evaluated and action taken thereon in accordance with the procedures contained in this chapter; provided, however, that the following limitations apply: 
(a)  The alternative proposal and variations requested shall achieve the same basic objectives as the particular standards, which are to be varied. 
(b)  Where the proposal seeks to vary project size limitations, the alternative design shall be evaluated in accordance with standards applicable to larger projects. 
(6)  Conservation development incentives. Conservation development will be considered for conservation incentives commensurate with the quality and character of the open or natural lands to be placed within a conservation easement or otherwise conserved and the extent to which the conserved land contributes to the preservation of open or natural lands, significant stands of native trees and any other areas of substantial vegetation, and scenic and ecological values. Incentives will be considered on a project-by-project basis and will be approved by the town council only after community input and public hearing, except that expedited development review shall be approved administratively. Such incentives may include but are not limited to: expedited development review, permit fee waivers, reduced street infrastructure requirements, as reflected in the town's thoroughfare plan, reduction in park land dedication requirements of not more than the percentage of land set aside for a conservation easement, and reduction of monetary assessments relative to agricultural rollback taxes. The purpose of this criterion is to protect the open lands, natural landscapes and ecological resources that create and define Flower Mound's unique community character and which are essential to the accomplishments of community character, quality of life and economic development objectives. 
(7)  No increase in density. No residential application or project shall be approved that increases residential density beyond the density allowed in the master plan.

Sec. 98-811. - Purpose and intent. 
The PD planned development district (PD) is designed to permit flexibility and encourage a more creative, efficient and aesthetically desirable design and placement of buildings, open spaces and circulation patterns by allowing a mixture or combination of uses and to best utilize special site features such as topography, size and shape. A planned development district may be used to permit new or innovative concepts in land utilization not permitted by other zoning districts in this Code. While greater flexibility is given to allow special conditions or restrictions that would not otherwise allow the development to occur, the requirements established herein ensure against the misuse of such increased flexibility. It is intended for application in all land use designations on the land use map of the master plan, provided that the uses and development standards proposed are consistent with the stated goals of the town's master plan. 
(Ord. No. 65-13, § 2, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 98-812. - Approval process. 
Every planned development district approved under the provisions of this chapter shall follow the procedure for, and be considered, an amendment to the zoning map. The application for a planned development district shall comply with the zoning amendment procedure for a change in zoning district classification. An applicant for a planned development district shall specify the base zoning district to be applied, the proposed use or combination of uses, proposed development regulations including all requested deviations from the base zoning district and any other requirements of this Code, and be accompanied by a concept plan(s). The concept plan(s) shall be attached to and made a part of the ordinance establishing the planned development district. 
(Ord. No. 65-13, § 2, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 98-813. - Criteria for approval. 
In approving the planned development district, the town council may impose conditions relative to the quality and standards of development. Based upon the concept plan, the planning and zoning commission and town council shall determine whether the PD district should be established, taking into account the following criteria: 
(1)  The proposed planned development district is consistent with the town's, vision, goals, objectives, and policies adopted in the master plan; 
(2)  Proposed uses and project design are compatible with existing and planned adjoining uses and the character of the neighborhood in which the project is located; 
(3)  Adequate public facilities required to be installed by the developer will be provided in a timely manner to support each phase of the development in accordance with the SMARTGrowth program; 
(4)  Proposed uses and development standards are consistent with the purposes of the base zoning district, where applicable; and 
(5)  The proposed phasing of development is consistent with the overall growth and development of the town. 
(Ord. No. 65-13, § 2, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 98-814. - Submittal requirements. 
(a)  Overview of requirements. In establishing a planned development district in accordance with this division, the town shall require a zoning exhibit of the development, plans, drawings, standards, and any other appropriate supportive information requested by the town manager or his designee that demonstrates compliance with the criteria for approval listed above. 
(b)  Application required. In submitting an application for the PD, the applicable submittal requirements are contained in the development application for a PD as may be updated from time to time. The town's development review committee (DRC) shall review the application for completeness and compliance with the town's master plan and all applicable ordinances and regulations.

Sec. 98-848. - Compliance with area plan components. 
All development in the CC campus commercial district shall be in compliance with the components outlined in the area plans for the Lakeside Business District or the Denton Creek district. For development within the Lakeside Business District Area Plan, campus commercial means a mixture of uses which includes corporate offices, office parks, hotels, commercial, similar uses, and may include limited residential development. To ensure the appropriate mixture of uses is provided within the campus commercial district, residential development will only be allowed as part of a planned development meeting the criteria outlined below. 
(1)  Residential development criteria. Residential development shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  Residential uses shall be limited to 25 percent of the overall building square footage in any new planned development in the campus commercial district. The remaining 75 percent of building square footage shall pertain to non-residential uses. For the purposes of this section, a residential use shall include any building area used primarily for the purpose of leasing or selling residential dwelling units within the planned development as well as any building area not open to the general public and intended for the exclusive use of residents of the residential space and their guests, such as a gym or other indoor recreational area. 
b.  A phasing plan outlining the percentage mix of residential and non-residential development that will be built in each phase must be submitted with the zoning application, noting the restriction that only the final phase can be comprised of exclusively residential development. 
c.  Buildings used for residential development are limited to a maximum of four stories in height to ensure that residential buildings do not dominate the skyline in an area intended primarily for non-residential use. 
d.  Central core or "wrapped" parking structures surrounded on two or more sides with residential units, are required for multi-family uses. No more than 20 percent of the required parking for multi-family uses shall be provided as surface parking. 
(2)  Parking structures for non-residential uses. Parking structures designated to meet non-residential parking requirements may count toward the percentage of non-residential building square footage, provided they meet the following standards: 
a.  Utilize a unified design theme tying the parking structure to other nearby structures within the development. 
b.  Incorporate architectural screens or other techniques to mitigate any adverse visual effects of the parking garage to pedestrians and adjacent properties. 
c.  Provide space to satisfy at least 80 percent of the required parking of the use(s) identified on the proposed concept plan. 
d.  Are greater than two stories. 
(3)  Open space. The provision of adequate and appropriate open space areas shall be integral to all planned developments in the campus commercial district incorporating residential uses. To ensure this is provided, open space shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  The minimum requirement for open space in these types of projects is five percent of the gross area of the site, which shall be dedicated open space and shall be included in the zoning change/development plan application. 
b.  The identified open space can also be used to meet parkland dedication requirements, as outlined in chapter 90. However, if payment of cash in lieu of dedication is selected, the five percent open space requirement would remain, as the open space requirement stands on its own and should not be considered a substitution for, nor a requirement in addition to, the language already noted in chapter 90. 
c.  Any open space provided in excess of five percent may be eligible for density bonus provisions as outlined below. Required landscaping, buffers, and detention/retention areas are not counted toward the open space requirement. 
(4)  Bonus provisions. 
a.  An applicant may apply for a residential density bonus of up to ten percent to equal a maximum of 35 percent of the overall building square footage. In order to be considered for bonus provisions, the applicant shall provide a list and conceptual design of amenities/design elements on the required concept plan, proposed residential and non-residential (if known) uses and/or tenants for identified buildings, and elevations highlighting proposed building designs. 
b.  The planning and zoning commission shall make a recommendation to the town council on the requested bonus package. The town council shall make the final decision on the appropriateness of the amenity/design package for the bonus requested, and may grant all, some, or none of the allowable bonus based on the amenity/design package. 
(5)  Considerations toward achieving a residential density bonus: 
a.  Focus and design based on placemaking that incorporates the following elements: 
1.  Use of pedestrian scale design elements including sidewalks/walkways/trails with appropriately scaled shade, planters, and seating along streets and building facades. 
2.  Use of pedestrian linkages throughout the development.

Streetscape treatments. Streetscape treatments include all improvements in a right-of-way and adjacent to it that create an attractive and safe pedestrian environment. Treatments shall include street trees, street light standards, street furniture, and trash receptacles. Streetscape treatments may also include a range of provisions features such as paving materials, street/pedestrian/wayfinding signs, media boxes, parking meters, utility boxes, seating, public art/water features, bike racks, bollards, information kiosks, etc., and similar features. 
Thoroughfare plan. The thoroughfare plan is a component of the town's master plan. The thoroughfare plan, as amended, serves as the community's blueprint for the town's future transportation network based on the future land use allocation and intensity. 
Vertical mixed use. Vertical mixed use is a building or structure in which at least one of the upper floors of a commercial building has residential uses (live-work units or lofts) with a mixture of retail or office uses at the other levels of the building or structure, or office uses above ground floor retail uses. 
(Ord. No. 62-08, § 2, 10-6-2008)  
Sec. 98-900. - General district standards. 
(a)  Generally. A mixed use zoning district shall consist of a minimum of two of the following three distinct components designated in the ordinance creating the district: a mixed use core, mixed use neighborhood, and mixed use transition. Land uses in the district shall be established based upon the overall character and design of the district. All MU's shall contain appropriately designed and scaled open spaces to preserve existing wooded areas, stream corridors and views, and invite passive recreational activities. All MU's shall contain appropriate transitions to adjacent land uses. 
(b)  Mixed use core area. The mixed use core area shall be the primary location of the highest intensity commercial uses including retail uses and offices for business, professional and technical uses. Residential uses in the mixed use core area shall be limited to upper floors of any building and as specified under [section 98-901], table 1, Schedule of Uses. 
(c)  Mixed use neighborhood. The mixed use neighborhood is a component area of the MU that is predominantly residential in nature. Limited retail and civic uses may be located at key points within the neighborhood. The location of the mixed use neighborhood shall be determined based upon the overall character and design of the proposed district and the following criteria: 
(1)  The mixed use neighborhood component, if incorporated into the MU, is to be located between the mixed use core and any mixed use transitions; 
(2)  The mixed use neighborhood shall be well integrated with proposed open space and other civic uses to create a sense of place; 
(3)  The mixed use neighborhood shall also be integrated with proposed mixed use core and mixed use transitions in a manner that provides internal automobile and pedestrian access; and 
(4)  Uses in the mixed use neighborhood shall be to the density and scale that is appropriate based on the context and character of the proposed district. 
(d)  Mixed use transition. The mixed use transition component is the area that forms the transition between the mixed use core or mixed use neighborhood to adjoining conditions. Based on site-specific adjacency conditions, a mixed use transition zone may be one or more of the following: 
(1)  Neighborhood transition zone. The neighborhood transition zone shall include residential uses that are of compatible scale and density to the immediately adjacent existing neighborhoods. 
(2)  Major roadway transition zone. A major roadway corridor is either an arterial roadway or state highway. This transition area shall be the only appropriate location for more automobile- oriented commercial uses due to the adjacency and access along the roadway while transitioning to a pedestrian-oriented development towards the interior of the site. A major roadway transition may include transitions from a rail road right-of way or corridor. 
(3)  Environmental transition zone. The environmental feature may be a creek, water body, significant grades, or tree stands. In particular, the environmental transition zone shall consider appropriate buffers and edge conditions to the specific environmental resource in order to maximize its intrinsic value to the overall mixed use development as a focal point. 
(e)  Open space. The open space component shall be integrated into the overall design of the mixed use zoning district. 
(1)  The type, scale, location, and design of the open space component shall depend on the context and location of the other components of the MU. 
(2)  Squares, parks, greens, and environmental preserves are encouraged in all components. Plazas may serve as open spaces and shall only be appropriate in the mixed use core. 
(Ord. No. 62-08, § 2, 10-6-2008)

Sec. 98-902. - Development standards. 
(a)  Standards in the MU are intended to facilitate the development of unique and pedestrian-friendly environments. To this end, design and development standards are intended to be tailored to create such an environment. In order to provide flexibility in use with prescription of the building form, all applicable development standards for each development project in the MU, including listing any applicable sections of Subpart B, Land Development Regulations that the particular development project may be exempt from, shall be established via the ordinance rezoning the property. If there are any conflicts between standards in table 3 below and any other standards in Subpart B, Land Development Regulations, then the standards in table 3 below shall prevail. 
(b)  Accessory usesSec. 98-1032. Accessory buildings shall apply unless other standards are proposed by the applicant and approved by town council. 
(c)  The following standards shall apply to development in the mixed use zoning district. Most standards have a numerical range and few have a specific numerical value. Due to the inapplicability of one development standard across all mixed use districts and to encourage a diversity of development proposals, the developer shall propose the standards indicated as "flexible" or "permitted/flexible" on the following table for the proposed development at the time of concept plan application submittal (see [subsection 98-904(b)(2)]) for concept plan submittal requirements in the MU district).

Expanses of blank walls exceeding 25 continuous feet are prohibited along all type A streets and 40 continuous feet along all other streets except alleys. 
(4)  All buildings in the MU zoning district shall be constructed with exterior building materials and finishes of a quality to convey an impression of permanence and durability. Materials such as masonry, stucco, stone, terra cotta, ceramic tiles, and similar durable architectural materials are allowed and shall be approved with the concept plan for the district. 
(5)  Nonresidential buildings and sites shall be organized to group the utilitarian functions away from the public view of any street (with the exception of alleys). Delivery and loading operations, HVAC equipment, trash compacting and collection, and other utility and service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the buildings and landscaping. The visual and acoustic impacts of all mechanical, electrical, and communications equipments (ground and roof-mounted) shall not be visible from adjacent properties and public streets, and screening materials and landscape screens shall be architecturally compatible with and similar to the building materials of the principal structures on the lot. 
(f)  Location and design of off-street parking. 
(1)  The applicant shall provide standards for the quantity of off-street parking proposed in the district based on an analysis of the parking demand for the mix of uses proposed and availability of on-street parking in the district. section 82-74 shall be used as a guide to establish the amount of parking required for uses proposed in the MU if the applicant does not specifically provide alternative standards. The town council may establish the alternative parking standards proposed by the applicant in the ordinance establishing the district. 
(2)  Off-street parking for all uses located along type A streets shall be limited to 25 percent or less of the block frontage and 50 percent or less on type B streets, arterial, collector, and highway frontage streets (see corresponding building frontage requirement). 
(3)  Any off-street surface parking area located adjacent to a street or a residential use shall be screened in the form of a landscape fence which is at least four feet in height. 
(4)  A surface parking lot may not be adjacent to a street intersection or square, or occupy a lot that terminates a street vista. 
(5)  Shared parking facilities are encouraged for nonresidential uses in the MU. 
(6)  Bicycle parking shall be provided for nonresidential uses, especially for schools, parks, trails, and other recreational facilities. Bicycle parking shall be provided at a rate of five percent of all off-street automobile parking spaces provided for nonresidential and mixed uses in the district. Bicycle parking may be shared between uses and shall be centrally located, easily accessible, and visible from streets or parking lots. They may be located between the roadway and the building facades as long as their location does not impede pedestrian walkways. 
(7)  Any offstreet parking provided for residential uses shall be located in such a manner as to minimize the impact of garages and driveways along the residential street. All residential lots that are less than 60 feet in width shall have off-street parking and/or garages accessed from alleys. All lots 60 feet and wider may have front loaded garages (pull-through garages), but in no case shall the width of the garage exceed 30 percent of the front facade width of the entire building. In addition, the garage shall be set back at least three feet from the front facade of the home. 
(g)  Civic/open space standards. 
(1)  The provision of adequate and appropriate civic/open space areas shall be integral to all development in the district. The minimum requirement for civic/open space in the district is five percent of the gross area of the site which shall be dedicated open space and shall be included in the zoning change/development plan application for a proposed MU. Any open space provided in excess of five percent may be eligible for bonus provisions as outlined in subsection (h). 
(2)  The civic/open space provided shall be appropriately designed and scaled in each of the district components. 
(3)  The following criteria shall be used to evaluate the merits of proposed civic/open spaces in the MU: 
a.  The extent to which environmental elements preserved are considered as "features" or "focal points" and integrated into and prominently located as "front yards" in the development; adding value to the development; 
b.  The extent to which emphasis has been placed on preservation of existing wooded areas, view sheds, water bodies, topography, and stream corridors in a natural and contiguous state; 
c.  The extent to which pedestrian connectivity in the form of sidewalks, natural walking paths along stream and creek corridors has been addressed; and 
d.  The extent to which a range of open spaces have been provided to be contiguous with existing open spaces and to invite passive recreational uses from plazas and squares to playgrounds, parks and environmental preserves, appropriately organized within the respective MU component. 
(4)  Open spaces may be in the form of pocket parks, children's play areas, squares, linear greens, and environmental preserves. Active sports fields and structured recreational activities shall be limited to less than ten percent of any parks located in the district. 
(h)  Landscaping standards. 
(1)  The purpose of landscaping in the MU is to enhance pedestrian and open space areas, to help delineate active areas from passive areas, to provide a screening buffer between pedestrians and vehicular circulation, utility functions, and incompatible adjacent developments. 
(2)  The applicant shall submit a landscape concept plan in conjunction with the zoning change and concept plan application. The landscape concept plan establishes the design direction and general schematics for all proposed landscaping including all aspects of the public realm such as street trees, plant/tree palette, streetscape treatments, pavement details, front yards, and medians; proposals for required parking lot landscaping, screening, design concepts for all open spaces, and lighting. 
(3)  Proposed landscaping shall meet the following standards: 
a.  Be pedestrian oriented. 
b.  Designed in such a way to not create a security or physical hazard to pedestrians, bicyclists or motorists. 
c.  Enhance or complement the architectural design of the mixed-use development.

(1)  Development in the MU core and environmental transition zones shall be eligible for specific height and density bonuses as provided in this section. 
(2)  The applicant shall provide a list and conceptual design of amenities/design elements with minimum performance standards in conjunction with specific blocks or building sites for increased heights and intensities on the required concept plan for the MU. 
(3)  The planning and zoning commission shall make a recommendation to the town council on the proposed bonus package and the town council shall make the final decision on the appropriateness of the amenity/design package for the bonuses requested. 
(4)  Criteria for evaluating height bonuses in the mixed use core and environmental transition zones: 
a.  The following minimum standards shall apply to all buildings that exceed the height limitations within the core and environmental transition zones: 
1.  Distance requirement of 1,200 feet from any existing adjacent neighborhood as measured from the closest property line of any platted residential subdivision not entitled under the MU; 
2.  A minimum increase in open space of three percent over the base requirement; 
3.  A minimum 12-foot building step back from the front facade at the 6th story, provided that the front facade faces and is located on a public street, and 
4.  A minimum of 50 percent of the ground floor building area built and occupied as a nonresidential use only. In the event the building that exceeds permitted height limitations is part of a functionally related complex of buildings, the ground floor nonresidential use requirement may be transferred to a different building or floor within the complex. 
b.  In addition to the above standards, the planning and zoning commission and town council shall take into consideration the following criteria in evaluating height bonuses in the MU: 
1.  Visual impacts of the buildings on adjacent neighborhoods and roadways; 
2.  Impact of site specific conditions such as grades, vegetation, automobile and pedestrian access; 
3.  Design considerations such as: 
i.  The extent to which the architectural design of the mid-to high rise buildings are appropriately integrated with the overall context of the mixed use zoning district including terminating important vistas and creating community landmarks; 
ii.  The extent to which transitions have been considered to adjoining buildings and neighborhoods; and 
iii.  The extent to which amenities such as plazas, square, and other civic spaces are integrated with the building design.

(Ord. No. 62-08, § 2, 10-6-2008; Ord. No. 50-09, § 2, 12-7-2009)  
Sec. 98-905. - Modifications. 
(a)  Mixed use standards. The town council may approve modifications to any of the standards in the MU after a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission based on unique site conditions and development context at the time of the application. In granting a modification, the town council may impose any conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to protect the public interest and implement the goals of the town's master plan with respect to mixed use. However, an applicant may submit to the zoning board of adjustment a request for a variance and the board may grant variances to any specifically established standards approved by the town council in the ordinance establishing the particular MU. All such requests will be subject to the standards imposed upon the zoning board of adjustment in section 78-85 of this Code. 
(b)  Park land dedication and park development fees requirements . The park land dedication and park development fee requirements set forth in division VIII of article 6, chapter 90 shall apply and exclusively govern MU mixed use zoning districts. This division 25 of article III, chapter 98 does not authorize park land dedication or park development fee standards that deviate from the requirements of division VIII of article 6, chapter 90. 
(c)  Tree preservation. 
(1)  General. In mixed use development projects, tree mitigation shall be evaluated in regard to the district as a whole based on the tree survey. Tree survey and planting requirements shall comply with chapter 94 "trees." Compliance with the requirements regarding tree removal and mitigation within the mixed use development shall comply with the following standards. 
(2)  Tree removal. 
a.  Undergrowth and unprotected trees. A property-owner/developer may, in its discretion, remove understory growth, including but not limited to vines, shrubs, briars and bushes, and trees that are three caliper inches or less in diameter, however neither protected nor specimen trees as shown on the tree survey shall be removed without the submittal and approval by the town of a tree removal permit. 
b.  Removal of protected or specimen trees. The removal of specimen or protected trees located within a lot or site do not require a tree removal permit, however; such trees shall not be removed from a lot or site prior to all of the conditions listed in this subsection being met. No protected or specimen trees may be removed from a lot or site prior to the approval of a development plan, site plan, plat or replat. In addition, a pre-construction meeting with appropriate town staff shall occur prior to the removal of any protected or specimen tree and/or the authorization of grading and construction activities to begin on the lot or site. 
(3)  Mitigation requirements for authorized tree removal. Tree mitigation requirements for mixed use districts shall not apply to non-residential uses within the mixed use project. Mitigation requirements for residential uses for mixed use districts shall comply with the following provisions. 
a.  Protected trees on-site. It shall be the responsibility of any person removing a protected tree from a lot or site to replace each protected tree so removed with one tree having a caliper of two and one-halfthree inches, measured in accordance with the terms of chapter 94 "Trees." 
b.  Specimen trees on-site. It shall be the responsibility of any person removing a specimen tree from a lot or site to replace each specimen tree removed with one or more trees that total twice the caliper inches of the specimen tree(s) removed as measured in accordance with the terms of chapter 94 "trees." For example, if a 30-inch specimen tree is removed, it would be replaced with 60 caliper inches comprised of 20, three-inch caliper trees, five, 12-inch caliper trees or some other combination of trees the caliper measurement of which equates to 60 caliper inches. 
c.  Mitigation payments. Mitigation payments in lieu of planting replacement trees shall be calculated and submitted to the town for approval. Fees in lieu of planting shall be paid to the town's tree preservation fund. 
d.  Mitigation credits and incentives for preservation of protected and specimen trees. If any protected or specimen tree is preserved on a lot or site, credits for said preservation shall be given that will count toward the replacement or mitigation requirements within the lot or site. Credits will accrue only for those trees whose measured drip lines are left predominantly in their natural state. Minimal cutting, filling or other construction-related activities are allowed within the drip line of trees eligible for credits to the extent only that such trees are not damaged or killed by such activity within their drip line. Said credits will accrue as follows. 
1.  For each protected tree preserved or transplanted within a lot or site or transplanted elsewhere in the site, one tree credit shall be given. 
2.  For each specimen tree preserved or transplanted within a lot or site or transplanted elsewhere within the site, credit for caliper width equivalent to the caliper width of the tree preserved or transplanted shall be given. For example, preserving or transplanting a specimen tree having a 30-inch caliper width would result in 30 caliper inches of credit, or ten, three-inch caliper trees. 
3.  For purposes of this section, one credit shall be given for landscaping trees planted in compliance with the mixed use district landscaping standards. 
(Ord. No. 62-08, § 2, 10-6-2008; Ord. No. 49-12, § 2, 10-1-2012; Ord. No. 13-19 , § 5, 4-15-2019)  
Sec. 98-906. - Amendments to approved plans or regulations established in an MU ordinance. 
(a)  The concept plan shall establish an overall vision for the proposed development within the framework of flexible design standards as established by the applicant in conjunction with the zoning application. Any changes to the concept plan that are beyond the range of flexibility provided in the ordinance establishing the specific district shall be considered as major changes to an approved MU and shall be reviewed by staff and subject to planning and zoning commission recommendation and town council approval. The executive director of development services may approve minor changes to and deviations from an approved site plan with the applicant's written justification for such changes. Minor changes may be approved administratively by the executive director and a revised concept plan shall be filed with the town. Any changes shall be reviewed cumulatively from the last town council approved concept plan. Major changes to an approved MU shall include any of the following: 
(1)  Any change in area of a component zone in excess of 20 percent greater or less than approved in a concept plan. 
(2)  Deletion or addition of a component zone or change in location of a component zone relative to any other component zones or adjacent properties. 
(3)  Elimination or change in an external connection (automobile or pedestrian) that negatively impacts any adjacent properties. 
(4)  A ten percent or greater reduction in the gross amount of open space that was approved in a concept plan. 
(5)  A change that results in a 30 percent or greater transfer of open space between any of the component zones as compared to the approved concept plan. 
(6)  Any changes to the development standards that were approved with the ordinance creating the MU district. 
(7)  Any increases or reductions in the land use mix proposed in any phase of the development that was approved as part of the original MU concept plan. 
(b)  If the proposed change is major as defined by subsection (a) above or conflicts with regulations specified within the ordinance establishing the MU, it shall be processed as an amendment to the zoning ordinance, and must be approved by the town council after a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. 
(c)  If the town receives an application to rezone only a portion of the property within an MU established by ordinance, the town may consider the request for rezoning that portion and is not required to rezone the remainder of the property. However, the zoning change requested shall be evaluated based on the purpose, intent, and context of the proposed changes.

Sec. 98-951. - Use regulations generally. 
Land and buildings in each district may be used for any of the principal or accessory land uses authorized in the regulations set forth for that district in division 2 of article III of this chapter, IH interim holding district, through division 23 of article III of this chapter, CI campus industrial district, but no land shall hereafter be used, and no building or structure, shall hereafter be occupied, used, erected, altered, removed, placed, demolished or converted that is arranged or designed to be used or used for other than those uses specified for the district in which it is located, other than accessory uses incidental to a permitted principal use and complying with the provisions of section 98-972, accessory use, general. 
(Code 1989, ch. 12, § 3.05(a); Ord. No. 71-00, § 2, 10-16-2000)  
Sec. 98-952. - Use classification. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The use regulations of the zoning districts are based on the use classification system of this section. The purpose of the provisions of this section is to classify uses of land into a number of specially defined land use categories on the basis of common functional characteristics and similar compatibility with other uses, thereby providing a basis for regulation of uses in accordance with criteria that are directly relevant to the public interest. The provisions of this section shall apply throughout this chapter. 
(b)  Classification of principal uses. The use categories listed in the use regulations schedule in subsection (c) of this section shall be considered to be principal uses, with the exception of uses listed in the "accessory and temporary uses" category. A single lot, other than a lot used for residential dwelling purposes, may contain more than one principal use, or a single use that has the characteristics of more than one use category, unless otherwise prohibited by the provisions of this chapter. All existing and proposed uses shall be classified into the use category that most closely portrays the overall nature of such activity. Any use that cannot be so classified shall not be permitted in any district. 
(c)  Schedule of use regulations. The following use regulations schedule summarizes the use regulations of the districts. In the event of any conflict between the use regulations schedule and the text of the zoning district regulations, the text shall control. Uses that were established prior to the adoption of this chapter or its predecessors, but that are now inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter, shall be permitted if such uses meet the requirements of article V, chapter 78 of this Code, nonconformities, for a valid nonconforming use. The use regulations schedule shall be interpreted as follows: 
(1)  Permitted uses. Uses identified in a particular district column with a "P" shall be permitted in such district, subject to compliance with all applicable conditions and provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Specific uses. Uses identified in a particular district column with an "S" shall be permitted in such district only upon approval of a specific use permit by the town council in accordance with the procedures and standards of section 98-953, specific use permits. 
(3)  Temporary uses. Uses identified in a particular district column with a "T" shall be permitted in such district only upon approval of a temporary use permit in accordance with the procedures and standards of [section] 78-87 of this Code, temporary use permits. 
(4)  Not permitted. Uses not identified in a particular district column with a "P," "S" or "T" are not allowed in such district, unless otherwise expressly permitted in this chapter. 
(5)  Use conditions. Numbers occurring in parenthesis after the names of selected use categories refer to conditions applicable to such use and set forth in subdivision III of this division, special use conditions.

Sec. 98-954. - Expiration or automatic renewal of SUPs. 
(a)  Except for uses where a mandatory expiration and automatic renewal option is otherwise required, a specific use permit granted in accordance with section 98-953 may include an expiration date or a provision providing eligibility for automatic renewal upon submission of a complete application package with automatic renewal requirements. 
(b)  Failure to timely file a complete renewal application will render a specific use permit ineligible for automatic renewal. The town council may, however, reinstate a SUP's eligibility for future automatic renewals as part of a new SUP ordinance or ordinance amendment. 
(c)  Automatic renewal does not result in an amendment to the SUP ordinance. An applicant seeking to change the SUP conditions or to otherwise amend the SUP ordinance must submit a new SUP application, as outlined in section 98-953.

No renewal or expiration of a SUP may occur while the application is pending consideration. 
(h)  This subsection does not impair the ability of the town council to call a public hearing on its own motion for the purpose of passing an amending ordinance to repeal a SUP's eligibility for automatic renewal, or to supplement, remove, or amend any of the conditions or other provisions in a SUP ordinance.

Before any modifications, revisions or deletions are made that conflict with the approved site plan including, but not limited to, the addition or removal of signs, concessions vendors, amusements and rides an amended site plan shall be submitted for review and approval three business days prior to commencement or continuation of the event in accordance with and pursuant to the amended site plan. Resubmittals or revised site plans shall be limited to one change per event. Not withstanding the timely submittal of the amended site plan the carnival, circus or special event shall not be authorized to operate in accordance with and pursuant to said amended site plan until such time as the amended site plan is approved. The amended site plan shall be approved or disapproved no later than three business days after submittal. An additional plan review fee shall be paid, as provided in the fee schedule found in appendix A of this Code, for the one allowed amended revised site plan at the time of submittal for review. 
A submittal, including a submittal for an amended site plan, shall not be reviewed until it is complete. An amended site plan shall be submitted together with all information, detail and supporting documentation as is required for the initial submission to obtain a permit. In addition, the submission of an amended site plan shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee. Failure to pay the fee or the omission of any component required for an original submittal may result in the delay, denial or revocation of the requested permit and/or amended site plan. 
(4)  Exception. A sidewalk sale or a religious or educational program, presentation or fund-raising event that is contained entirely upon or entirely within the confines of private property and does not require the temporary use of or closing off of public streets, fire lanes or public property; that lasts or runs for no more than eight hours on any one day and is limited to a total of four consecutive days in any calendar month; and, which is planned, presented, performed, offered or sponsored by and for the sole benefit of a nonprofit entity ("exempt event") shall not be required to obtain a special event permit. The fact that an event or gathering is held on Lewisville Independent School District ("LISD") property does not, in and of itself, make the event or gathering an exempt event. However, any event or gathering that is a component of, and which is specifically related to, the educational mission, programming and curriculum of LISD including LISD sponsored extracurricular activities in an exempt event. 
(5)  Safe and orderly movement of normal traffic shall not be substantially interrupted. The town may require the permit holder to provide additional signage for traffic control and safety-related issues, as deemed necessary by staff. If any circus, carnival, or special event is located adjacent to or abutting a TXDOT-controlled road, a TXDOT sign permit must be obtained and signs must be in place before the event starts. (The specific requirement for TXDOT signs may be waived if staff determines that sufficient traffic control measures are already in place.) 
(6)  The temporary carnival, circus or special event shall not impede the movement of fire fighting equipment, ambulances or any other emergency vehicle.

(9)  Any person or entity that seeks a permit for an event shall be required to pay all costs and expenses including, but not limited to, labor and overtime costs as well as materials, gasoline and equipment rental or usage incurred by the town to provide onsite police protection for the race and its participants as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the town to erect and take down warning signs, cones and barricades along and about the course to be traveled by the race participants. The town may require that the person or entity seeking a permit or to whom a permit is issued post a cash bond or deposit with the town against which the town may recover all such costs and expenses. Failure to post such a cash deposit or bond may result in the denial of the permit application or revocation of a previously issued permit. Events that are sponsored entirely, or in part, by the town may, in the sole discretion of the town, be excepted from the requirement to post a cash deposit or bond for such town-sponsored event. In the event that security precautions for the event are materially different than those contained in the permit application or in the event public safety is or may be compromised, then such concerns shall first be communicated by a town representative to the permit holder or designee of t he permit holder in an effort to expeditiously to resolve any such public safety concerns. In the event such public safety concerns are not adequately addressed, the town manager or his or her duly appointed representative may revoke the permit. 
(10)  Only one race or rally upon and across the roads, streets and thoroughfares of the town shall be allowed per day unless otherwise approved by the town. Dates for such races or rallies shall be assigned by the police department and maintained in the office of the community services department. If two or more such race or rally events are planned for the same date, the special event permit will be awarded first to a race or rally event that is sponsored entirely by the town. In all other circumstances, the special event permit shall be awarded to the race or rally event that first submits a fully completed permit application for the date in question. 
(11)  The permit will be valid for a maximum period of five days. If the permit is issued in conjunction with a seasonal sales permit, this permit shall last for no more than 31 days and will expire the same day as the seasonal sales permit expires. 
(12)  All signs for a special event must conform with the following provisions regarding signage, rather than and instead of chapter 86 "Signs", of this Code. An event shall be allowed only onpremise signs meeting the following provisions: 
a.  One primary event identification sign no greater than 32 square feet in size and ten feet in height measured from average ground level fronting on or facing the public right-of-way that is visible and/or legible from the public right-of-way; and 
b.  Two secondary signs no greater than ten square feet in size and six feet in height measured from average ground level that do not front on or face the public right-of-way and are not legible from the public roadway; and 
c.  One five square-foot entrance sign and one five square-foot exit sign no greater than three feet in height measured from average ground level at each point of ingress and egress on the subject property; and 
d.  Temporary directional or informational signs that shall be no greater than five square feet in area and three feet in height measured from average ground level, within 25 feet of the base of said sign, to the highest point of the sign. The temporary directional or interior signs permitted by this section include, but are not limited to, signs that provide directional assistance to parking areas, and identify one-way drives, concessions areas, amusements or rides or exhibitions. This provision is not intended to prohibit or exclude signs placed over or above doorways, concessions, amusements, rides or exhibitions if such signs are not visible or legible from the public right-of-way. No signs permitted under this subparagraph shall be visible from the public right-of-way. All signs permitted by this subparagraph shall be for interior use only. 
e.  All signs, excluding the five square-foot entrance and five square-foot exit signs, shall be set back at least 20 feet from the public right-of-way. The five square-foot entrance and five square-foot exit signs shall not be located within the public right-of-way. 
f.  Internal and external illumination of special event signs shall be prohibited. 
g.  The following balloons or inflatable devices excluding inflatable slides and inflatable jump houses, which excluded inflatable devices are considered amusements, shall be allowed: 
1.  One balloon or inflatable device up to a height not to exceed 35 feet measured from average ground level, within 25 feet of the base of said balloon or inflatable device, to the highest point of the balloon or inflatable device shall be permitted or allowed onpremise during the temporary carnival, circus or special event provided that it meets the requirements of subsection f. below. 
2.  All other balloons or inflatable devices shall not exceed a height of 20 feet measured from average ground level, within 25 feet of the base of said balloon or inflatable device, to the highest point of the balloon or inflatable device shall be permitted or allowed onpremise during the temporary carnival, circus or special event provided that it meets the requirements of subsection f. below. 
h.  All balloons and inflatable devices on the premises, which are identified as being allowed in subsection e. above, shall be spaced no closer than 20 feet from closest edge to closest edge of another balloon or inflatable device. In addition said balloons and inflatable devices shall be further constrained by the following requirements: 
1.  Balloons or inflatable devices may be internally illuminated only. External illumination shall be prohibited. 
2.  No portion of any balloon or inflatable device shall be located in, on, over, or above any public right-of-way.

(16)  A carnival, circus, or special event permit may be denied if: 
a.  A special event permit has been granted for another special event at the same place and time; or 
b.  The proposed special event will unreasonably disrupt the orderly flow of traffic and no reasonable means of rerouting traffic or otherwise meeting traffic needs is available; or 
c.  The application is incomplete; or 
d.  The applicant fails to comply with or the proposed special event will violate a town code or other applicable law, unless the prohibited conduct or activity would be allowed under this section; or 
e.  The applicant makes a false statement of material fact on an application for a special event permit; or 
f.  The applicant, or the operator of the event (the "event operator"), or the owner of the premises on which the event is planned (the "property owner") has had a special event permit revoked within the preceding 12 months or the applicant, event operator or property owner have individually or collectively entered a plea of guilty and/or been convicted of two or more violations of a condition or a provision of a special event permit or of this section within the preceding 11 months; or 
g.  The proposed special event would unduly burden town services, and pose a risk to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(17)  a.  The town may revoke a carnival, circus, or special event permit if: 
1.  The applicant fails to comply with or the carnival, circus, or special event is in violation of a condition or a provision of the permit or the site plan and any amended site plan, an ordinance of the town, or any other applicable law; or 
2.  The permit holder made a false statement of material fact on an application for a carnival, circus, or special event permit; or 
3.  The carnival, circus, or special event unduly burdens town services or unreasonably disrupts the public order and poses a risk to the public health, safety and welfare. 
b.  The applicant, event operator, and/or the property owner shall immediately, upon receiving notice that the town has revoked the carnival, circus, or special event permit, cause the event to cease operations and close and shut down all component parts of the event.

The applicant, event operator, and/or the property owner may appeal the revocation of the carnival, circus, or special event permit to the town manager by filing a written request for appeal of said revocation with the town secretary's office, the town manager's office and the department that revoked said permit within three calendar days after the permit was revoked. 
d.  The written request for appeal shall identify the contact person for the carnival, circus, or special event and provide the contact person's telephone number, e-mail address and fax number to assist in scheduling a hearing on said appeal. The written request for appeal shall also state in detail what actions have been or will be taken to guarantee that the conditions which gave rise to the revocation will not recur. 
e.  Such an appeal shall not stay the revocation of the permit or authorize the continued or renewed operation of the carnival, circus, or special event. 
f.  The revocation appeal hearing shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, be scheduled to occur within three business days after receipt of the written request for appeal. The appeal shall be heard by the town manager or the town manager's duly authorized representative (referred to collectively as the "town manager"). The applicant, event operator, or property owner may present information regarding the revocation and the actions that have been taken or will be enacted to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that led to the permit revocation. Town staff shall also be allowed to present information regarding the revocation and opine regarding the continued or renewed operation of the carnival, circus, or special event with the additional conditions proposed by the applicant, event operator, or property owner. 
g.  The town manager shall uphold the revocation or overrule the revocation. The town manager may also overrule the revocation and impose such additional conditions on the continued or renewed operation of the carnival, circus, or special event as the town manager deems prudent to avoid a recurrence of the conditions that led to the permit revocation. If the town manager overrules the permit revocation, the operation of the carnival, circus, or special event may be renewed or continued provided that any and all additional conditions for operation are enacted and observed. 
h.  Any aggrieved party may appeal the town manager's determination to the board of adjustment in the manner provided for appeals of an administrative official's decision. The carnival, circus, or special event may be renewed or continued during the pendency of an appeal to the board of adjustment if and only if the town manager overrules the permit revocation and provided that any and all additional conditions for operation imposed by the town manager are enacted and observed. 
(18)  The granting of a special event permit does not relieve the applicant, event operator or property owner from complying with all other provisions of the town's Code of Ordinances (e.g. tent permits, building permits, electrical permits, food establishment and handling permits). All other permits and licenses required by code or other law for specific activities conducted in conjunction with or as a part of the carnival, circus, or special event must be applied for separately in a form satisfactory to the town. 
(19)  A person commits an offense if he/she: 
a.  Commences or conducts a carnival, circus, or special event without the appropriate permits or fails to comply with any requirement or condition of a permit or this ordinance; or

After the 12 months of inoperability, the building official is authorized to issue a notice of abandonment to the owner of the small wind energy system. The owner shall have the right to respond to the notice of abandonment within 30 days from the notice receipt date. After review of the information provided by the owner, the building official shall determine if the system has been abandoned. If it is determined that the system has not been abandoned, the building official shall withdraw the notice of abandonment and notify the owner of the withdrawal. 
(6)  If the owner fails to respond to the notice of abandonment or if, after review by the building official, it is determined that the small wind energy system has been abandoned or discontinued, the owner of the system shall remove the wind generator and tower at the owner's sole expense within three months of receipt of the notice of abandonment. If the owner fails to physically remove the system after the notice of abandonment procedure, the building official may pursue legal action to have the system removed at the owner's expense. 
(f)  Violation. It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to construct, install, modify, or operate a small wind energy system that is not in compliance with this section. Small wind energy systems installed prior to the adoption of this section are exempt from this section except when modifications are proposed to the system. 
(g)  Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation who fails to comply with any provision of this section or a building permit issued pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction, shall be fined a sum not to exceed $2,000.00 for each offense, and each and every violation or day such violation shall continue or exist, shall be deemed a separate offense. The penal provisions imposed under this section shall not preclude the town from filing suit to enjoin the violation. The town retains all legal rights and remedies available to it pursuant to local, state and federal law.

Subdivision II. - Nonresidential Uses and Multifamily Uses 
 
Sec. 98-1121. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Purpose. Good outdoor lighting at night benefits everyone and enhances the town's nighttime character. New lighting technologies have produced lights that are extremely powerful, and these types of lights may be improperly installed so that they create problems of excessive glare and light trespass that reduce residents' privacy. Excessive glare can be annoying and may cause safety problems. There is a need for a lighting ordinance that recognizes the benefits of good outdoor lighting and provides clear guidelines for its installation so as to help maintain and complement the town's character and which strives to provide linkage between the built and natural environment and acknowledges and sustains the unique nature of the town's corporate-commercial, suburban and rural lifestyles. Appropriately regulated, and properly installed, outdoor lighting will contribute to the safety and welfare of the residents of the town. 
(b)  Objectives. Outdoor lighting for nonresidential uses and multifamily uses has the following objectives: 
(1)  It is intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting in those areas zoned for nonresidential uses and multifamily uses; 
(2)  It is intended to eliminate problems of glare and minimize light trespass by establishing regulations which limit the area that certain types of outdoor lighting fixtures can illuminate and by limiting the total allowable illumination of lots located in the town; 
(3)  All lighting installed in nonresidential uses and multifamily uses should be designed with the idea of being a good neighbor, thereby eliminating or reducing unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting properties or streets; 
(4)  It is the declared purpose of this subdivision that nonconforming luminaries be eliminated and be required to conform to the regulations of this subdivision within a reasonable time.

The zoning regulations of this article shall apply only to planned development districts approved prior to the effective date of this chapter. This article contains the following five types of obsolete zoning regulations: 
(1)  Obsolete districts. The MF-1, MF-2 and CC districts have been removed from the remainder of this chapter and shall not henceforth be applied to any property in the town. The standards of these districts shall continue to apply only in planned development districts approved prior to the effective date of this chapter that reference the regulations of these districts in the adopting ordinance. 
(2)  Modified dimensional regulations. Some of the dimensional regulations for single-family detached dwellings have been modified as of the effective date of this chapter. The original regulations existing prior to the effective date of this chapter and retained in this article shall continue to apply only to planned development districts approved prior to the effective date of this chapter that reference the dimensional regulations of such districts in the adopting ordinance. 
(3)  Obsolete use. Some planned development districts approved prior to the effective date of this chapter authorize the development of single-family detached (medium density) dwellings. The development standards for single-family detached (medium density) dwellings contained in this article shall continue to apply to such districts. 
(4)  Obsolete planned development standards. Prior to the effective date of this chapter, the town's zoning ordinance contained specific development standards for uses other than single-family detached (medium density) dwellings in planned development districts. These standards applied in planned development districts where no other standards were specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance. These standards shall continue to apply to such districts, but shall not be applicable to planned development districts approved after the effective date of this chapter. 
(5)  The SF-1, SF-2 and SF-3 districts have been recodified by this chapter. SF-1 has been recodified as SF-30, SF-2 has been recodified as SF-15, and SF-3 has been recodified as SF-10. Zoning that has been approved prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be subject to the corresponding regulations contained in this article.

70-223 	Industrial waste charges 
 
The method of cost allocation or derivation of industrial waste charge may be computed by the generalized formula: 
Ci = v o Vi + b o Bi = S o Si 
Note: The principal applies equally well with additional terms, e.g., chlorine feed rates. 
Where Ci = charge to industrial users, $/yr. 
V o = unit cost of treatment chargeable to volume, $/100 gal. 
b o = unit cost of treatment chargeable to BOD, $/lb. 
s o = unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment) chargeable to SS, $/lb. 
Vi = volume of wastewater from industrial users, gal/yr. 
Bi = amount of BOD from industrial users; lb/yr. 
Si = amount of SS from industrial users, lb/yr. 
The constants n, v o , b o s o Vi, Bi and Si shall be defined in a separate ordinance and are subject to change at least annually in accordance with section 70-224. 
For example, secondary treatment plant servicing a municipality is enlarged from 2 MGD to 6 MGD. 
Anticipated loading at the completion of the project.

  ×.065* 
Uniform Annual Payment 	$31,200.00 
 
*Capital Recovery Factor, 30 years at 5 percent 
**The portion attributable to excess capacity for future use should ideally be charged to property to the extent that the entire community benefits. As utilized capacity increases, the portion of recoverable costs paid for from general revenues should be gradually reduced until, at design capacity, all revenues result from the user's charges. However, if it is evident that a portion of the excess capacity is assignable to a particular industry or industries, then it is necessary to include that portion of capital costs in the total to be allocated under the cost-recovery system. 
Capital cost. 
Uniform Annual Payment 	 $31,200.00

This method of allocation implies technical knowledge of the extent to which component costs are attributable to the components of volume and loading. This technical knowledge will vary considerably by component costs and is not generally a precise determination for any component of total project costs.

Application of costs to formula. 
Ci - v o Vi + b o Bi = s o Si 
Ci = Charge to industrial users in $ 
Vi = Volume of wastewater from industrial users, 1,000 gal./month 
Bi = weight of BOD from industrial users, lb/month 
Si = weight of SS from industrial users, lb/month 
Industrial waste charge formula for municipality. 
v o = $0.0237/1,000 gal. 
b o = $0.0150/lb. 
s o = $0.096/lb. 
Ci = $0.00237 Vi + $0.0096 Si 
Assume: 
Vi = 250,000 gallons 
Bi = 500 mg/l = 1042.5 lb.

SECTION 3  
3.1. - Police power of town. 
Grantee shall at all times during the initial and any successive renewal term of the franchise granted by this ordinance be subject to all lawful exercise of police power by the town.  
3.2. - Conditions of street occupancy. 
All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines and equipment installed or erected by the grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own property that adjoins any of said public ways. The location, route and installation of all such transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines and equipment installed or erected by grantee within the service area shall be subject to the reasonable and proper regulation control and direction of the town manager or of any other town official to whom such duties have been or may be delegated.  
3.3. - Restoration of public ways. 
If during the course of grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by grantee, grantee shall, at its sole expense, replace and restore such public way to a condition that is as good as or better than the condition of the public way existing immediately prior to such disturbance.

Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than five business days, the grantee shall, at its own expense, protect support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the public way, or remove from the public way, any property of the grantee when lawfully required by the franchising authority by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of structures or improvements by the franchising authority; but, the grantee may with the consent of the franchising authority have the right of abandonment of its property. If public funds are available to any company using such street, easement or right of way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, such funds shall also be made available to the grantee.

The grantee shall reasonably compensate the franchising authority, or property owner for any damages caused by such trimming or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense, reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any construction of the cable system undertaken by grantee. Such replacement shall satisfy any and all obligations grantee may have to the franchising authority or property owner pursuant to the terms of this section. 
Cross reference Vegetation, ch. 94.  
3.7. - Use of grantee's equipment by franchising authority.

3.8. - Safety requirements. 
Construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in accordance with applicable FCC or other federal, state and local regulations. The cable system shall not unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of persons or property in the service area.  
3.9. - Aerial and underground construction. 
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground. In those areas of the service area where the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are both aerial and underground, grantee shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or underground. Nothing contained in this section 3.9 shall require grantee to construct, operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other related equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 3.9, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective date of this ordinance, grantee shall only be required to construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities at the time that such are placed underground.  
3.10. - Required extensions of service during initial term. 
During the initial term of the franchise, grantee is hereby authorized and directed to extend the cable system within the service area, as required pursuant to the terms hereof. Whenever grantee shall receive a request for service from at least 20 subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall, as hereinafter provided, extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers, provided that such extension is technically feasible: 
a.  Grantee shall immediately initiate the planning and budgetary process for such extension upon receiving a request for service from at least 20 subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable; and 
b.  Grantee shall initiate construction on such extension within 12 months of (a) above; and 
c.  Grantee shall complete construction within six months of commencing such construction in (b) above; and 
d.  Grantee shall provide written notification of the availability of cable service to all subscribers that can be served by such system extension within 30 days of completing such construction in (c) above.  
3.11. - Required extensions of service during renewal terms. 
After the initial term of the franchise and during any renewal term thereof, grantee shall be authorized and directed to extend the cable system within the service area, as required pursuant to the terms hereof. Whenever grantee shall receive a request for service from at least ten subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall as hereinafter provided, extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers, provided that such extension is technically feasible: 
a.  Grantee shall immediately initiate the planning and budgetary process for such extension upon receiving a request for service from at least ten subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable; and 
b.  Grantee shall initiate construction on such extension within 12 months of (a) above; and 
c.  Grantee shall complete construction within six months of commencing such construction in (b) above; and 
d.  Grantee shall provide written notification of the availability of cable service to all subscribers that can be served by such system extension within 30 days of completing such construction in (c) above.  
3.12. - Subscriber charges for extensions of service. 
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground where not otherwise required to be underground, the existence of more than 150 feet of distance from distribution or feeder cable to subscriber's service connection, a density of less than 20 subscribers per 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable during the initial term of this franchise, or a density of less than ten subscribers per 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable during any renewal term of this franchise, cable service or other service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by grantee and subscribers in the area in which cable service may be expanded, grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers per 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 20 subscribers during the initial term of this franchise, and whose denominator equals ten subscribers during any renewal term of this franchise. Potential subscribers will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. Grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.  
3.13. - Service to public buildings. 
The grantee shall provide without charge one outlet of basic service to the franchising authority's office building(s), fire station(s), police station(s), and public school building(s) that are passed by its cable system. The outlets of basic service shall not be used to distribute or sell cable services in or throughout such buildings; nor shall such outlets be located in common or public areas. To the extent permitted by law, the franchising authority shall hold grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the use of such outlets, including but not limited to, those arising from copyright liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section 3.13, the grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to said buildings or premises exceeds 300 cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and so long as it will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market development of the cable system to do so, or unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 300 cable feet. In the event that additional outlets of basic service are provided to such buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees associated therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials. Upon request of grantee, the building owner may also be required to pay the service fees associated with the provision of basic service and the additional outlets relating thereto.  
3.14. - Emergency override. 
Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, install an emergency management interrupt system in the head-end for the benefit of the franchising authority. This system may be remotely activated by the franchising authority by installing a touch-tone telephone line, the cost of which is to be borne solely by the franchising authority. In the case of any emergency or disaster, the franchising authority would then be able to use the remote telephone to provide emergency information and instructions during the emergency or disaster period. To the extent permitted by law, the franchising authority shall hold the grantee, its agents, employees, officers and assigns hereunder, harmless from any claims arising out of the emergency use of its facilities by the franchising authority, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  
3.15. - Performance evaluations. 
Under the direction of the franchising authority, the franchising authority and grantee shall jointly conduct scheduled performance evaluation sessions within 30 days of the second, fourth, sixth and eighth year anniversary dates of the effective date of this ordinance. All performance evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and announced in a local newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the meeting. Grantee shall submit to the franchising authority within 20 days of the performance evaluation, a written report identifying comments made by the public and grantee's responses.  
3.16. - Maps. 
Grantee shall file annually with the franchising authority current maps showing the location of grantee's cables.  
3.17. - Public, educational and governmental access. 
Within 30 days of the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall dedicate one channel to the town for public, educational and/or governmental (PEG) access programming. This PEG channel will be available to any public or non-profit group, pursuant to applicable provisions of the Communications Act. At such time as the cable system is expanded pursuant to section 3.19 hereof, grantee will dedicate two additional channels, for a total of three channels, to the town for public, educational and/or governmental (PEG) access programming. These PEG channels will be available to any governmental, educational, public or nonprofit group, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Communications Act.  
3.18. - Public, educational and governmental access equipment. 
a.  Within 60 days of the effective date of the franchise, grantee shall provide and install at its own expense the following PEG access in the town's new town hall facility: 
1.  One VCR, Panasonic "Pro-Line" AG-1970 or its equivalent; 
2.  One "Portable" camera, Panasonic "Pro-Line" AG455 or its equivalent; 
3.  Two JVC Model TK 1280U fixed-mount cameras with Pelco remote control system or its equivalent; 
4.  One Videonics MX-1 Digital Video Mixer or its equivalent;

This equipment shall become the sole responsibility of the franchising authority subsequent to its installation in the town hall facility, including maintenance and replacement. 
b.  At the franchising authority's request, the cable operator will impose a surcharge on subscriber bills, not to exceed $.50 per month, for the production and/or cable-casting of PEG access programming, pursuant to applicable provisions of the communications act. Said surcharge, if imposed, shall be remitted to the franchising authority by grantee on an annual basis and in the same manner provided for grantee's annual payment of the franchise fee, as set forth in section 4.1 hereof. Grantee, at its option, may separately identify such surcharge, if imposed, on subscriber's monthly bills.  
3.19. - Programming services and system technology. 
Grantee's cable system shall be capable of delivering to subscribers a minimum of 58 full-time video programming services (channels) no later than three years from the effective date of this franchise ordinance. Exclusive of pilot tests and/or demonstration projects, "state of the art" broadcast, programming, transmission, security and other system technology, as defined, identified and installed by grantee in its other cable systems throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, shall be installed and employed throughout the cable system at all times during the initial or any successor term of the franchise. Digital compression and fibre optic technology will be installed and employed throughout the cable system at such time that said technology is installed and employed by grantee in the first 50 percent of its other cable systems throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. 
SECTION 4  
4.1. - Franchise fee. 
In consideration for the rights and privileges herein granted, the value of such rights and privileges, the administration of this franchise by the town, the usage and interference with the public's usage of public ways within the service area, and the costs and obligations undertaken by the franchising authority herein, grantee shall pay to the franchising authority an annual franchise fee equal to five percent of gross revenues, as defined in section 1.1 hereof, received by grantee from the operation of the cable system on an annual basis. 
a.  For the purpose of this section, the 12-month period applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the franchising authority and grantee. 
b.  The annual franchise fee payment for the preceding calendar year shall be due and payable no later than April 1. Each such payment shall be accompanied by a financial report from grantee, prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the cable industry, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the franchise fee computation. 
c.  To the extent consistent with [section] 5.2 herein, grantee shall maintain and shall make available for audit by the franchising authority, within a reasonable response time and upon reasonable notice, all non-proprietary and non-confidential financial and operating records reflecting the amounts of and basis for computation of all annual franchise fee payments to the franchising authority. All such accounts and records shall be kept according to generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the cable industry. 
d.  The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five years from the date on which payment by the grantee is due. Unless within five years from and after said payment due date the franchising authority initiates a lawsuit for recovery of such franchise fees in a court of competent jurisdiction, such recovery shall be barred, and the franchising authority shall be estopped from asserting any claims whatsoever against the grantee relating to any such alleged deficiencies. 
e.  The franchising authority, with six months written notice to grantee, hereby reserves the right to increase the franchise fee provided for herein up to a maximum amount or percentage of gross revenues currently or in the future allowed by the communications act, not to exceed a maximum amount or percentage of seven and five-tenths percent of gross revenues. Grantee, at its option, may include such franchise fee increase as a surcharge to subscribers. 
f.  The franchise fee payments required herein to be paid by grantee shall be paid and received in lieu of any tax, license, charge, fee, street or alley rental or other character of charge for use and occupancy of the public ways of the franchising authority; in lieu of any pole tax or inspection fee tax; in lieu of any easement or franchise tax, whether levied as an ad valorem, special or other character of tax; and in lieu of any imposition other than the usual general or special ad valorem taxes and sales taxes now or hereafter levied, and the reasonable costs incurred by grantee or the franchising authority to restore that portion of a public way cut, excavated or damaged by the grantee. Should the franchising authority not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing franchise fee shall be in lieu of the taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals, and easement or franchise taxes aforesaid, then the franchising authority agrees that it will apply so much of said payment as may be necessary to the satisfaction of the grantee's obligation, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals and easement or franchise taxes imposed by the franchising authority.  
4.2. - Rates and charges. 
The franchising authority may regulate rates to the maximum extent provided by the Communications Act, as it now exists or as it may hereafter be amended, or by any subsequent or successor federal or state law or regulation determined to have preempted or superseded the Communications Act in this regard.  
4.3. - Renewal of franchise. 
The franchising authority and the grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the franchising authority that relate to the renewal of the grantee's franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Communications Act, as it now exists or as it may hereafter be amended, unless the procedures and substantive provisions set forth therein shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent or successor federal or state law or regulation.  
4.4. - Conditions of sale. 
Except to the extent expressly required by federal or state law, if a renewal or extension of grantee's franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the franchising authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the cable industry. Grantee and franchising authority agree that in the case of a lawful revocation of the franchise, at grantee's request, which shall be made in its sole discretion, grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party. The franchising authority further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize the grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time, grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably acceptable to the franchising authority, grantee and franchising authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law; it being further agreed that grantee's continued operation of its cable system during said six-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the franchising authority or the grantee. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither franchising authority nor grantee shall be required to violate federal or state law.  
4.5. - Transfer of franchise. 
Grantee's right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate, without franchising authority's express written consent.  
4.6. - Service offerings. 
In accordance with Section 623(f) of the Communications Act, grantee shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.  
4.7. - Regulation by franchising authority. 
Nothing in this franchise shall prohibit the franchising authority from regulating any matter relative to the operation of the cable system and the offering of cable services by the grantee, the authority of which to regulate is recognized by any local, state or federal law.  
4.8. - Consumer protection. 
Customer service requirements of the grantee, consumer protection rights of subscribers, construction schedules and other construction-related requirements of the grantee, and other health, safety and welfare measures related to the grantee's operation of the cable system and its provision of cable services shall be in conformance with the requirements of the Communications Act and FCC regulations related thereto as they now exist or may hereafter be amended, specifically including 47 C.F.R. Part 76 (Subpart H), on file in the office of the town secretary as "Exhibit A" and incorporated herein by reference. 
SECTION 5  
5.1. - Testing for compliance. 
The franchising authority may perform technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or not the grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable state or federal laws. Except in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two business days, and providing a representative of grantee an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the grantee. In the event that such testing demonstrates that grantee has substantially complied with such material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the franchising authority. Except in emergency circumstances, the franchising authority agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no more than two times a year in the aggregate, and that the results thereof shall be made available to the grantee upon grantee's request.  
5.2. - Books and records. 
The grantee agrees that the franchising authority may review such of its books and records, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with the terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public records required to be kept by the grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, grantee shall not be required to disclose information deemed confidential of proprietary by law. The franchising authority agrees to the extent allowed by law to treat any information disclosed to it by the grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. 
SECTION 6  
6.1. - Insurance requirements. 
Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the franchise, comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage. Said insurance shall designate the franchising authority as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon 30 days prior written notice to the franchising authority.  
6.2. - Indemnification. 
The grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the franchising authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages to persons or property and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of its cable system, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and costs.  
6.3. - Bonds and other surety. 
Except as expressly provided herein, grantee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the franchise or continuing its existence. The franchising authority acknowledges that the legal, financial and technical qualifications of grantee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement thereof. Grantee and franchising authority recognize that the costs associated with bonds and other surety may ultimately be borne by the subscribers in the form of increased rates for cable services. In order to minimize such costs, the franchising authority agrees to require bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during such times as there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefor. The franchising authority agrees that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in an aggregate amount greater than $10,000.00, conditioned upon the substantial performance of the material terms, covenants, and conditions of the franchise. Initially, no bond or other surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the future, the franchising authority agrees to give grantee at least 60 days prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the requirement. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the grantee's legal, financial or technical qualifications which would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the franchise or afford compliance therewith. 
SECTION 7  
7.1. - Notice of franchise violation. 
In the event that the franchising authority believes that the grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify grantee in writing of the exact name of the alleged noncompliance.  
7.2. - Grantee's right to cure or respond. 
Grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in section 7.1: (a) to respond to the franchising authority contesting the assertion of noncompliance, or (b) to cure such default, or (c) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the franchising authority of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.  
7.3. - Public hearing. 
In the event that grantee fails to respond to the notice described in section 7.1, pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 7.2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 30 days after the grantee is notified of the alleged default pursuant to section 7.1, the franchising authority shall schedule a public meeting to investigate the default. Such public meeting shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the franchising authority which is no less than five business days therefrom. The franchising authority shall notify the grantee of the date, time and place of such meeting and provide the grantee with an opportunity to be heard.  
7.4. - Enforcement.

In the alternative, grantee may, with the consent of the franchising authority, abandon its property.

Subject to any applicable state or federal laws, regulations or tariffs, the franchising authority shall have the right to make additional use, for any public purpose, of any poles or conduits controlled or maintained exclusively by or for the grantee in any public way; provided that (a) such use by the franchising authority does not interfere with a current or future use by the grantee, and (b) at grantee's sole discretion, the franchising authority may be required either to pay a reasonable rental fee or otherwise reasonably compensate grantee for the use of such poles, conduits or equipment. Further provided; however, that grantee agrees that such compensation, or charge shall not exceed those paid by it to public utilities pursuant to the applicable pole attachment agreement, or other authorization, relating to the service area.  
3.8. - Safety requirements. 
Construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner.

In those areas of the service area where the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are both aerial and underground, grantee shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or underground. Nothing contained in this section shall require grantee to construct, operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other related equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective date of this ordinance, grantee shall only be required to construct, operate and maintain, all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities at the time that such are placed underground.  
3.10. - Required extensions of service during initial term. 
During the initial term of the franchise, grantee is hereby authorized and directed to extend the cable system within the service area, as required pursuant to the terms hereof. Grantee shall extend the cable system to all areas of new residential and commercial development. Whenever grantee receives a request for service from at least 20 subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall, as hereinafter provided, extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers, other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers, provided that such extension is technically feasible: 
a.  Grantee shall immediately initiate the planning and budgetary process for such extension upon receiving a request for service from at least 20 subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable; and 
b.  Grantee shall initiate construction on such extension within 12 months of (a), above; and 
c.  Grantee shall complete construction within six months of commencing such construction in (b), above; and 
d.  Grantee shall provide written notification of the availability of cable service to all subscribers that can be served by such system extension within 30 days of completing such construction in (b), above.  
3.11. - Required extensions of service during renewal terms. 
After the initial term of the franchise and during any renewal term thereof, grantee shall be authorized and directed to extend the cable system within the service area, as required pursuant to the terms hereof. Grantee shall extend the cable system to all areas of new residential and commercial development. Whenever grantee shall receive a request for service from at least ten subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall, as hereinafter provided, extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers, provided that such extension is technically feasible: 
a.  Grantee shall immediately initiate the planning and budgetary process for such extension upon receiving a request for service from at least ten subscribers within 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet (one cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable; and 
b.  Grantee shall initiate construction on such extension within 12 months of (a), above; and 
c.  Grantee shall complete construction within six months of commencing such construction in (b), above; and 
d.  Grantee shall provide written notification of the availability of cable service to all subscribers that can be served by such system extension within 30 days of completing such construction in (c), above.  
3.12. - Subscriber charges for extensions of service. 
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as (i) a subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground where not otherwise required to be underground, (ii) the existence of more than 150 feet of distance from distribution or feeder cable to subscriber's service connection, (iii) a density of less than 20 subscribers per 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable during the initial term of this franchise, or (iv) a density of less than ten subscribers per 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable during any renewal term of this franchise, cable service or other service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by grantee and subscribers in the area in which cable service may be expanded, grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers per 5,280 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 20 subscribers during the initial term of the franchise. Potential subscribers will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. Grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.  
3.13. - Service to community facilities. 
Subject to the provisions in this section, the outlets of basic service shall not be used to distribute or sell cable services in or throughout such community facilities nor shall such outlets be located in common or public areas. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to said buildings or premises exceeds 300 cable feet, unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees to pay the incremental cost, or unless it is technically feasible and will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market development of the cable system to do so. In the event that additional outlets of basic service are provided to such buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees associated therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials. Upon request of grantee, the building owner may also be required to pay the service fees associated with the provision of basic service and the additional outlets relating thereto. 
a.  Public primary and secondary schools. Grantee shall provide without charge during the life of this franchise one free cable television service outlet at the most popular service level to each primary and secondary public school whose buildings are passed by its cable system. Grantee shall, at the school's request, provide an appropriate interface to any internal video distribution system in the school, so long as the school insures that such internal system complies with the FCC's signal leakage and signal quality standards and does not interfere with or adversely affect the system. There will be no charge for cable service on any additional outlets in the school except for a pass through of any charge imposed on grantee by a program supplier, and grantee may impose a charge for equipment for additional outlets. Grantee shall provide each connected school with a free connection to a Time Warner or similar on-line service for personal computers to the extent it is available on grantee's cable system and transmission network. Upon request each connected school will receive one free modem and free access to the Time Warner or similar on-line service for use during the school year. Additional modems shall be made available, upon request, at cost. Free access to the Time Warner or similar on-line service shall be provided through each such modem for use during the school year. In addition, grantee shall sponsor a workshop to educate teachers about the Time Warner or similar on-line service and to provide them with an opportunity for hands-on training. 
b.  Town facilities. Grantee shall provide one free cable television service outlet at the most popular service level during the life of this franchise to each municipal facility owned or operated by the town, served by public rights-of-way, and located within 1,000 feet of grantee's trunk or distribution cable. Each free outlet shall include, if necessary, a free converter and maintenance thereof by grantee. All additional cable television hardware and the installation thereof requested by town shall be provided by grantee, and the cost to the town shall not exceed grantee's direct cost. Grantee shall provide an appropriate interface to any internal video distribution system in the town's building, so long as the town insures that such internal system complies with the FCC's signal leakage and signal quality standards and does not interfere with or adversely affect the system. There will be no charge for cable service on any additional outlets in the town's facilities except for a pass through of any charge imposed on grantee by a program supplier, and grantee may impose a charge for equipment for additional outlets.  
3.14. - Emergency override. 
Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, install an emergency management interrupt system in the head-end for the benefit of the franchising authority. This system may be remotely activated by the franchising authority by installing a touch-tone telephone line, the cost of which is to be borne solely by the franchising authority. In the case of any emergency or disaster, the franchising authority would then be able to use the remote telephone to provide emergency information and instructions during the emergency or disaster period. To the extent permitted by law, the franchising authority shall hold the grantee, its agents, employees, officers and assign hereunder, harmless from any claims arising out of the emergency use of its facilities by the franchising authority, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  
3.15. - Performance evaluations. 
Under the direction of the franchising authority, the franchising authority and grantee shall jointly conduct scheduled performance evaluation sessions within 30 days of the first and third year anniversary dates of the effective date of this ordinance. All performance evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and announced in a local newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the meeting. Such publication costs shall be borne by grantee. Grantee shall submit to the franchising authority a written report identifying comments made by the public and grantee's responses within 20 days of the performance evaluation.  
3.16. - Maps. 
Grantee shall file annually on the anniversary date of this franchise with the franchising authority current maps showing the location of grantee's cables.  
3.17. - Public, educational and governmental access. 
Within 30 days of the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall make available to the town two channels as public, educational and government access (PEG) channels. Educational access shall mean a channel time reserved for use by education institutions located wholly or partially within the Town of Flower Mound, for the noncommercial programming associated with their educational functions. 
Grantee shall initially provide two noncommercial access channels for the public, educational institutions and government use. Thereafter, on the one year anniversary date of this franchise, grantee shall provide one additional access channel.  
3.18. - Public, educational and governmental access equipment. 
a.  Within 60 days of the effective date of the franchise, grantee shall provide and install at its own cost the following PEG access equipment in the town hall facility: 
1.  Three Canon 3 chip CCD cameras or equivalent; 
2.  Two JVC VCR recorder/players or equivalent; 
3.  One Bogen tripod or equivalent; 
4.  One Videonics TM-9U color monitor or equivalent; and 
5.  One return system to the grantee's head-end for the direct live cablecast of town meetings and functions held at the town hall facility. 
In addition to the above, the vendor installing said equipment shall furnish design documentation of such installation. The maintenance of the equipment shall become the responsibility of the franchising authority. 
b.  At the franchising authority's request, the cable operator will impose a surcharge on subscriber bills, not to exceed $0.50 per month, for the production and/or cable-casting of PEG access programming, pursuant to applicable provisions of the Communications Act. Said surcharge, if imposed, shall be remitted to the franchising authority by grantee on an annual basis and in the same manner provided for grantee's annual payment of the franchise fee, as set forth in section 5.1 [4.1] hereof. Grantee, at its option, may separately identify such surcharge, if imposed, on subscriber's monthly bills.  
3.19. - Programming services and system technology. 
Grantee's cable system shall be capable of delivering to subscribers a minimum of 58 full-time video programming services (channels) no later than three years from the effective date of this franchise ordinance. Exclusive of pilot tests and/or demonstrations projects, "state of the art" broadcast, programming, transmission, security and other system technology, as defined, identified and installed by grantee in its other cable systems throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, shall be installed and employed throughout the cable system at all times during the initial or any successor term of the franchise. Digital compression and fiber optic technology will be installed and employed throughout the cable system at such time that said technology is installed and employed by grantee in the first 50 percent of its other cable systems throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.  
3.20. - Closed caption. 
Grantee shall retransmit all closed-captioned signals made available by programmers in conjunction with programming in its line-up and which are provided in order to facilitate viewing by handicapped persons. Grantee shall maintain the necessary head-end equipment to make such features available to subscribers. Grantee's obligations under this section do not include providing customer premises equipment. 
SECTION 4  
4.1. - Franchise fee. 
In consideration for the rights and privileges herein granted, the value of such rights and privileges, the administration of this franchise by the town, the usage and interference with the public's usage of public ways within the service area, and the costs and obligations undertaken by the franchising authority herein, grantee shall pay to the franchising authority an annual franchise fee equal to five percent of gross revenues, as defined in section 1.1 hereof, received by grantee from the operation of the cable system on an annual basis. 
a.  Grantee shall pay to the town for each quarter this franchise remains in effect an amount equal to five percent of gross revenue, referred to as the "quarterly payment." Grantee shall make this payment by the 45th day following the close of the calendar quarter for which the quarterly payment is calculated. Any necessary prorations shall be made. 
b.  Grantee shall file annually with the franchising authority no later than 120 days after the end of the grantee's fiscal year, a statement of gross revenue for that year within the franchise area pursuant to this franchise. This statement shall set forth the gross revenue for the year in a reasonable form prescribed by the town after consultation with grantee. 
c.  To the extent consistent with section 5.2 herein, grantee shall maintain and shall make available for audit by the franchising authority, within a reasonable response time and upon reasonable notice, all non-proprietary and non-confidential financial and operating records reflecting the amounts of and basis for computation of all annual franchise fee payments to the franchising authority. All such accounts and records shall be kept according to generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the cable industry. 
d.  The period of limitation from recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five years from the date on which payment by the grantee is due. Unless within five years from and after said payment due date the franchising authority initiates a lawsuit for recovery of such franchise fees in a court of competent jurisdiction, such recovery shall be barred, and the franchising authority shall be stopped from asserting any claims whatsoever against the grantee relating to any such alleged deficiencies. 
e.  The franchising authority, with six months written notice to grantee, hereby reserves the right to increase the franchise fee provided for herein up to a maximum amount or percentage of gross revenues currently or in the future allowed by the Communication Act, not to exceed a maximum amount or percentage of seven and five-tenths percent of gross revenues. Grantee, at its option, may include such franchise fee increase as a surcharge to subscribers. 
f.  The franchise fee payments required herein to be paid by grantee shall be paid and received in lieu of any tax, license, charge, fee, street or alley rental or other character of charge for use and occupancy of the public ways of the franchising authority; in lieu of any pole tax or inspection fee tax; in lieu of any easement or local franchise tax, whether levied as an ad valorem, special or other character of tax; and in lieu of any imposition other than the usual general or special ad valorem taxes and sales taxes now or hereafter levied, and the reasonable costs incurred by grantee or the franchising authority to restore that portion of a public way cut, excavated or damaged by the grantee. Should the franchising authority not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing franchise fee shall be in lieu of the taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals, and easement or franchise taxes aforesaid, then the franchising authority agrees that it will apply so much of said payment as may be necessary to the satisfaction of the grantee's obligation, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals and easement or franchise taxes imposed by the franchising authority.  
4.2. - Rates and charges. 
The franchising authority may regulate rates to the maximum extent provided by the Communications Act, as it now exists or as it may hereafter be amended, or by any subsequent or successor federal or state law or regulation determined to have preempted or superseded the Communications Act in this regard.  
4.3. - Renewal of franchise. 
The franchising authority and the grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the franchising authority that relate to the renewal of the grantee's franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Communications Act, as it now exists or as it may hereafter be amended, unless the procedures and substantive provisions set forth therein shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent or successor federal or state law or regulation.  
4.4. - Conditions of sale. 
Except to the extent expressly required by federal or state law, if a renewal or extension of grantee's franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the franchising authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the cable industry. 
Grantee and franchising authority agree that in the case of a lawful revocation of the franchise, at grantee's request, which shall be made in its sole discretion, grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party. The franchising authority further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize the grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time, grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably acceptable to the franchising authority, grantee and franchising authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law; it being further agreed that grantee's continued operation of its cable system during said six-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the franchising authority or the grantee. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither franchising authority nor grantee shall be required to violate federal, state or local law.  
4.5. - Transfer of franchise. 
Grantee's right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate, without franchising authority's express written consent.  
4.6. - Service offerings. 
In accordance with Section 623(f) of the Communications Act, grantee shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.  
4.7. - Regulation by franchising authority. 
Nothing in this franchise shall prohibit the franchising authority from regulating any matter relative to the operation of the cable system and the offering of cable services by the grantee, the authority of which to regulate is recognized by any local, state or federal law.  
4.8. - Consumer protection. 
Customer service requirements of the grantee, consumer protection rights of subscribers, construction schedules and other construction-related requirements of the grantee, and other health, safety and welfare measures related to the grantee's operation of the cable system and its provision of cable services shall be in conformance with the requirements of the Communications Act and FCC regulations related thereto as they now exist or may hereafter be amended, specifically including 47 C.F.R. Part 76, on file in the office of the town secretary as "exhibit A" and incorporated herein by reference. 
SECTION 5  
5.1. - Testing for compliance. 
The franchising authority may perform technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or not the grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable state or federal laws. Except in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than one business day, and providing a representative of grantee an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the grantee has failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the grantee. Except in emergency circumstances, the franchising authority agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no more than five times per calendar year in the aggregate, and the results thereof shall be made available to the grantee upon grantee's request.  
5.2. - Books and records. 
The grantee agrees that the franchising authority may review such of its books and records, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with the terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public records required to be kept by the grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, grantee shall not be required to disclose information deemed confidential or proprietary by law. The franchising authority agrees to the extent allowed by law to treat any information disclosed to it by the grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. 
SECTION 6  
6.1. - Insurance requirements. 
Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the franchise, comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage. Said insurance shall designate the franchising authority as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon 30 days prior written notice to the franchising authority.  
6.2. - Indemnification. 
The grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the franchising authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of its cable system, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and costs. Such indemnification shall be construed as broadly as possible under applicable Texas law.  
6.3. - Bonds and other surety. 
Except as expressly provided herein, grantee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the franchise or continuing its existence. The franchising authority acknowledges that the legal, financial and technical qualifications of grantee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement thereof. Grantee and franchising authority recognize that the costs associated with the bonds and other surety may ultimately be borne by the subscribers in the form of increased rates for cable services. In order to minimize such costs, the franchising authority agrees to require bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during such times as there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefor. The franchising authority agrees that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in an aggregate amount greater than $10,000.00, conditioned upon the substantial performance of the material terms, covenants, and conditions of the franchise. Initially, no bonds or other surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the future, the franchising authority agrees to give grantee at least 60 days prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the requirements. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the grantee's legal, financial or technical qualifications which would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the franchise or afford compliance therewith. 
SECTION 7  
7.1. - Notice of franchise violation. 
In the event that the franchising authority believes that the grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify grantee in writing of the alleged noncompliance.  
7.2. - Grantee's right to cure or respond. 
Grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in section 7.1: (a) to respond to the franchising authority contesting the assertion of noncompliance, or (b) to cure such default, or (c) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the franchising authority of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.  
7.3. - Public hearing. 
In the event that grantee fails to respond to the notice described in section 7.1, pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 7.2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 30 days after the grantee is notified of the alleged default pursuant to section 7.1, the franchising authority shall schedule a public meeting to investigate the default. Such public meeting shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the franchising authority which is no less than three business days therefrom. The franchising authority shall notify the grantee of the date, time and place of such meeting and provide the grantee with an opportunity to be heard.  
7.4. - Enforcement. 
Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the franchising authority, after such public hearing, determines that grantee is or remains in default of any material provision of the franchise, the franchising authority may: 
a.  Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under this franchise, if any, including without limitation, any bonds or other surety; provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in such amount as the franchising authority reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the default; 
b.  Pursuant to section 6.3 hereof, require the grantee to provide bonds or other surety, in such amount as the franchising authority reasonably determines is necessary and sufficient to remedy the default. 
c.  Commence an action at law for damages or seek other equitable relief; 
d.  Declare the franchise agreement to be revoked; or 
e.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages. 
The grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly with any provision of the franchise by reason of any failure of the franchising authority to enforce prompt compliance.  
7.5. - Acts of God. 
The grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by strikes, acts of God or other events reasonably beyond its ability to control. 
SECTION 8  
8.1. - Unauthorized reception unlawful. 
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to create or make use of any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively or otherwise, with any part of the cable system without the express consent of the grantee. Further, without the express consent of grantee, it shall be unlawful for any person to tamper with, remove or injure any property, equipment or part of the cable system or any means of receiving cable service or other services provided thereto. Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, thereof, shall be punished by a fine as provided in section 1.06 of chapter 1 [section 1-13] of the town's Code of Ordinances. Each day any such violation or violations continue shall constitute a separate offense and be punishable as such. 
SECTION 9  
9.1. - Actions of franchising authority. 
In any action by the franchising authority or representative thereof mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
9.2. - Place of performance and venue. 
All rights, duties and obligations under this franchise ordinance are enforceable, and venue therefor shall reside in a court of competent jurisdiction in Denton County, Texas, or in the federal judicial district in which Denton County, Texas, is located.  
9.3. - Notice. 
Unless expressly agreed otherwise between the parties, every notice or response to be served upon the franchising authority or grantee shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party five business days after having been posted in a properly sealed and correctly addressed envelope by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, at a post office or branch thereof regularly maintained by the U.S. Postal Service.

Whereas, by Ordinance No. 64-93 passed and approved on December 6, 1994, the Town of Flower Mound, Texas ("Town"), granted to Communication Services, Inc., now Comcast of California/Colorado/Illinois/Indiana/Texas, Inc., d/b/a Comcast Cable of California/Colorado/Illinois/Indiana/Texas, Inc. ("grantee"), the right, privilege, and franchise to erect, maintain, and operate, for a term of ten years, a cable system in said town; and 
Whereas, grantee has provided cable services within the town under such franchise; and 
Whereas, grantee has requested a renewal of the franchise in accordance with section 626 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, to allow continued operation of a cable system in the town; and 
Whereas, the town council finds from all the evidence that grantee meets the legal, character, financial, and technical qualifications, as well as other qualifications necessary to assure that the residents of the town receive the best available cable service if provided in accordance with this franchise; and 
Whereas, following proper notice, the town council of the town held a public hearing on grantee's request for renewal, at which time representatives of grantee and interested citizens were heard in a full public proceeding affording opportunity for comment by any and all persons desiring to be heard; and 
Whereas, from information presented at such public hearing, from facts and circumstances developed or discovered through independent study and investigation, the town council now deems it appropriate and in the best interest of the town and its inhabitants that the cable service franchise be renewed with grantee. 
Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Town Council of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas:

By way of illustration and not limitation, gross revenue includes all fees charged subscribers for any and all cable services provided by grantee over the cable system such as basic cable service revenues, expanded basic cable service revenues, pay cable service revenues, revenues resulting from connection or reconnection to the cable system in order to receive cable services, revenues resulting from the lease, rental, use, repair, or servicing of cable system equipment used to receive cable service, revenues from late, delinquent, or other administrative fees applied to cable services, and franchise fees assessed on cable services which are collected from subscribers. Gross revenues shall also include advertising revenues received by the grantee which are attributable to cable services delivered over the cable system in the town, revenues resulting from the lease, use or rental of channels or channel capacity to provide cable services, revenues received by the grantee from commissions on sales from shopping cable services, and revenues received from programmers providing cable service programming over the cable system. Gross revenues shall not include those payments described in subsection 14.10 of this franchise. 
(i)  The town recognizes that, in the future, grantee may allocate revenue between cable services (which are subject to the franchise fee) and non-cable services (which are not subject to the franchise fee but may be subject to other fees and/or taxes), when these two types of service are bundled together in a discounted package offered to subscribers. Due to the uncertainties that currently exist, both in the business and regulatory environment on this issue, the town and the grantee hereby reserve all rights, claims, defenses and remedies regarding the town's authority to impose and/or enforce requirements related to the revenue allocation methodology to be used when cable services and noncable services are offered to subscribers in a discounted package, for the purpose of calculating franchise fee payments. 
(ii)  In the event that the town believes that grantee has unlawfully or unfairly allocated revenue between cable services and noncable services for the purpose of calculating franchise fee payments, the town and the grantee shall meet upon advance notice from the town to discuss the allocation methodology. If the town and the grantee cannot agree on the matter within a reasonable period of time, the town and grantee may submit the matter to a mutually agreeable third party for mediation. The cost of the mediation shall be shared equally between the town and the grantee. At any time, either the town or the grantee can bring the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction, or pursue any other remedies available to them in this franchise or by law. Unless otherwise approved by the town, the venue for any judicial dispute between the town and grantee arising out of this provision shall be the Civil District Court, Denton County, Texas, or the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas. If the court determines that the allocation of revenue to cable services violates this franchise, then the town would be entitled to the benefits of such a decision. 
(iii)  The parties intend for the definition of gross revenue to be as inclusive as possibly consistent with existing applicable law. If there is a change in federal law subsequent to the effective date of this franchise, such change shall not impact this gross revenues definition in such a way to reduce gross revenues unless the change specifically preempts the affected portion of the definition above. 
R.  Institutional network. A portion of the cable system constructed and maintained by grantee and which is only available for private, noncommercial use by governmental and/or educational entities pursuant to agreement between the grantee and the town. 
S.  Pay cable services. The delivery over the cable system of cable service programming to subscribers for a fee or charge over and above the charge for basic cable service or expanded basic cable service on a per-program, per-channel, per-connection or per-time period of connection basis.

V.  Person. Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization of any kind.

X.  Public rights-of-way. The surface, the air space above the surface, and the area below the surface of any public street, highway, lane, path, alley, sidewalk, boulevard, drive, bridge, tunnel, easement or similar property in which the town holds any property interest or exercises any rights of management or control and which, consistent with the purposes for which it was acquired or dedicated, may be used for the installation and maintenance of a cable system. No reference in this franchise to a public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the town that its interests or other rights in such property are sufficient to permit its use for the installation and maintenance of a cable system, and the grantee shall be deemed to gain only those rights which the town has the undisputed right and power to give. 
Y.  Subscriber. Any person lawfully receiving cable service delivered by means of the grantee's cable system. 
SECTION 3  
3.0. - Grant of authority.

Grantee or affiliates shall not install or construct facilities within the town's public rights-of-way which are not authorized by this franchise or lawfully allowed by applicable state or federal law. 
3.02  Use, rental, or lease of utility poles and facilities. There is hereby granted to grantee the authority to contract with the town or with the holder or owner of any utility franchise in the town for the use, rental, or lease of its or their poles, underground conduits, and other structures and facilities for the purpose of extending, carrying, or laying grantee's wires, cables, electronic conductors, and other facilities and appurtenances necessary or desirable in conjunction with the operation of its cable system. The town agrees that any public utility owning or controlling such poles or underground conduits may, without amendment to its franchise, allow, and is encouraged to allow, grantee to make such use thereof pursuant to any agreement reached between such utility and grantee. Nothing in this franchise shall authorize grantee to attach any part of its cable system to any town-owned conduits or facilities until grantee has entered into a separate agreement with the town, supported by independent consideration, for such rights of attachment or use. 
3.03  Additional services. By granting this franchise, the town does not waive, and specifically retains, any right to regulate and receive compensation as allowed by law for services offered over the cable system which are not cable services. Upon request, grantee shall inform the town of any non-cable service offered over the cable system of which grantee is aware. Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to limit any lawful authority of the town to impose a tax, fee, or other assessment of any kind on any person (other than the grantee, its affiliates, or other persons which are cable operators of the cable system pursuant to section 602(5) of the Communications Act), with respect to cable service or other communications service provided by such person over the cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received by the grantee, its affiliates or other persons who are cable operators of the cable system pursuant to section 602(5). Upon request, grantee shall inform the town of any uses of which grantee is aware of the cable system by persons who are not cable operators.

The grantee shall pay the amounts billed within 30 days. The parties agree that any amounts paid pursuant to this subsection are not franchise fees and fall within one or more of the exceptions to the definition of franchise fee under federal law. Nothing in this subsection is intended to affect in any way (by expansion or contraction) grantee's rights under applicable law governing rates. 
SECTION 4  
4.0. - Term, evaluation, and renewal.

D.  Following receipt of the report, but not less then 30 days prior to the performance evaluation, the town may request additional information, clarification or detailed documentation concerning those topics identified for inclusion in the performance evaluation. Grantee shall make reasonable effort to provide such additional information to the town prior to the meeting. In the event that the information cannot be made available prior to the performance evaluation, grantee shall notify the town in writing explaining the reasons for such delay. 
E.  The town council may hear any interested persons during such performance evaluation. The grantee shall be entitled to all the rights of due process consistent with the town proceedings, including but not limited to, the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel.

The town shall have the power at any time to order and require grantee to remove or abate any pole, line, tower, wire, cable, guy, conduit, electric conductor, or any other structure or facility that is dangerous to life or property. In the event grantee, after written notice, fails or refuses to act within 15 days of such written notice, town shall have the power to remove or abate the same at the expense of grantee, all without compensation or liability for damages to grantee except in instances where the damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. 
6.03  Notification in the event of pre-emptive law. Grantee shall use its best efforts to notify the town in the event of any change in law that materially affects grantee's rights or obligations under this franchise. 
SECTION 7  
7.0. - Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy. 
7.01  Use. All structures, wires, cables, equipment, and facilities erected or maintained by grantee within the town shall be located as to cause minimum interference with the proper and intended use of the public rights-of-way and with the rights or reasonable convenience of the owners or occupants of property which adjoins any of such public rights-of-way. The location of all poles, towers, anchors, wires, cables, electronic conductors, conduits, manholes and other structures and appurtenances in, over, under, along, and across the present and future public rights-of-way in the town shall be fixed under the supervision of the town or an authorized agent appointed by the town. Grantee agrees to comply with all other town laws, rules, or ordinances that govern the use of public rights-of-way that currently exist or may be applicable during the term of this franchise, provided that such are promulgated under the town's lawful police powers. In the event that there is conflict between requirements of this franchise and other generally applicable and lawful town ordinances governing grantee's ability to use the public rights-of-way, the stricter provisions shall apply. 
7.02  Excavation. Grantee may excavate only for the construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, and maintenance of all or a portion of its facilities used to provide cable service under this franchise. Except in the case of emergency maintenance, grantee shall provide the town written notice within 15 days of any proposed disturbance to any public rights-of-way prior to the commencement thereof. Grantee shall provide the town with notice within 24 hours following any emergency maintenance that disturbed the public rights-of-way. Owners or occupants of adjoining property shall be given reasonable notice. When the grantee shall make or cause to be made excavations or shall place obstructions in any public rights-of-way, the public shall be protected by barriers and lights placed, erected, and maintained by the grantee in accordance with any existing or future town, state, or federal requirements. No public rights-of-way shall be encumbered by construction, maintenance, removal, restoration, or repair work by grantee for a longer period than shall be necessary to execute such work. 
7.03  Restoration. The surface of any public rights-of-way disturbed by grantee in laying, constructing, maintaining, operating, using, extending, removing, replacing, or repairing its cable system shall be restored by grantee as soon as reasonably possible, but in no instance greater than 30 days after the completion of the work under normal operating conditions, at its cost and expense, to as good a condition as before the commencement of the work. The 30 day period shall be extended for days that the grantee is unable to perform the work due to unfavorable weather conditions. In the event restoration is scheduled to take longer than 30 days for any other reason, grantee shall provide the town with written notice as to the reason(s) for the delay. Such restoration shall be maintained by grantee to the satisfaction of the town for one year from the date of completion of such restoration work. If there is an unreasonable delay by grantee in restoring and maintaining public rights-of-way after such excavations or repairs have been made, town shall have the right, following written notice to grantee to which grantee has 48 hours in which to respond, to restore or repair the same and to require grantee to pay to the town the reasonable cost of such restoration or repair all without compensation or liability for damages to the grantee unless such damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. In the event town determines that grantee's use of any of town's public rights-of-way as set forth in this franchise poses an immediate danger to the health, safety or general welfare of the public, town shall have the right to restore or repair same and shall require grantee to pay to the town the reasonable costs incurred regarding same, all without compensation or liability for damages to the grantee unless the damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. 
7.04  Relocation. Whenever by reason of the construction, repair, maintenance, relocation, widening, raising, or lowering of the grade of any public rights-of-way by the town or by the location or manner of construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of any public property, structure, or facility by the town, it shall be deemed necessary by the town for grantee to move, relocate, change, alter, or modify any of its facilities or structures, such change, relocation, alteration, or modification shall be promptly made by grantee, when directed in writing to do so by the town. Grantee shall pay the cost of such relocation unless there are funds allocated to affected users of the public right-of-way, including grantee, for the reimbursement of such costs. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the town shall make application for such funds on behalf of the grantee, upon request of grantee, if grantee cannot make such application itself. In the event grantee, after such notice, fails or refuses to commence, pursue, or complete such relocation work within a reasonable time, the town shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to remove or abate such structures or facilities and to require grantee to pay to the town the reasonable cost of such removal or abatement, all without compensation or liability for damages to grantee unless such damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. 
7.05  Temporary removal of wire for building moving. Upon written request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the town, grantee shall remove, raise, or lower its wires and cables temporarily to permit the moving of houses, buildings, or other bulky structures. The reasonable expense of such temporary removal, raising, or lowering shall be paid by the benefited person, and grantee may require such payment in advance, grantee being without obligation to remove, raise, or lower its wires and cables until such payment shall have been made. Grantee shall be given not less than 72 hours' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire and cable adjustments. 
7.06  Tree trimming. From time to time, the town council may pass ordinances regulating the trimming or removal of trees on or along town property, and grantee shall comply with these ordinances. 
7.07  Placement of fixtures. Grantee shall not place poles, towers, or similar fixtures where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telecommunications, water hydrant, water main, drainage, sanitary sewer or other facilities located within the town's public rights-of-way as authorized by the town, and all such poles, towers, and similar facilities shall be placed as directed by the town and in such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel or use or visibility of the public rights-of-way. 
7.08  Removal of fixtures. Grantee shall remove its structures, wires, cables, equipment, and facilities of any and all kinds from the public rights-of-way within 30 days following the non-use or cessation of use of such structures, wires, cables, equipment, and facilities. 
7.09  Approval of plans and specifications. With the exception of installation of individual drops and/or emergency repairs, grantee shall provide complete plans and specifications for all construction within public rights-of-way to the town for its review in accordance with applicable town ordinances and permit application procedures. Approval of plans and specifications shall not be unreasonably delayed or denied. In the event of rejection, grantee shall submit revised plans and specifications for approval. This provision shall apply to each construction sequence if the construction is accomplished in phases. 
7.10  Underground installation. In those portions of the town having telephone lines and electric utility lines underground, whether required by ordinance or not, any and all of grantee's lines, cables, and wires shall also be underground. Grantee's lines, cables, wires, and similar facilities located above ground prior to the effective date of this franchise shall be relocated underground by grantee at the same time that other above-ground utility lines (e.g., electric and telecommunications lines) located within the immediate vicinity of grantee's facilities are placed underground. Grantee shall pay the cost of such relocation unless there are funds allocated to affected users of the public right-of-way, including grantee, for the reimbursement of such costs. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the town shall make application for such funds on behalf of the grantee upon request of grantee if grantee cannot make such application itself. It shall be the policy of the town that existing poles for electric and communications purposes be utilized by grantee whenever possible and that underground installation, even when not required, is preferable to the placing of additional poles. 
7.11  Facilities location. From time to time, the town or its representatives, may request identification of the specific location of certain grantee cable system facilities. The grantee agrees to respond to such request within 48 hours of the receipt of the request. In the event that grantee fails to provide the necessary information, and damage is caused to grantee facilities as a direct result of withholding said information, the grantee shall hold the town harmless from all liability, damage, cost or expense resulting from any town action in this regard unless such damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. 
The town shall have the right to be informed as to matters in connection with or affecting the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operations, and repair of the cable system facilities of the grantee within the public rights-of-way including, but not necessarily limited to, the identification and location of the grantee's cable system facilities within the public rights-of-way and to updates of such information as changes regarding same occur. At a minimum, this requires grantee to maintain on file with the town a current set of strand and trench drawings of the cable system. Such strand and trench maps shall be updated as changes occur in the cable system, and shall provide, as follows: 
A.  CAD drawings must be submitted in .dxf (drawing exchange file) format or other mutually agreeable format. 
B.  Drawings must be submitted digitally on either CD ROM or floppy diskette. 
C.  Drawings must be referenced in real world coordinates: 
(i)  North Central Texas State Plane; 
(ii)  Zone 5351; 
(iii)  NAD 83 datum; 
(iv)  Units feet. 
In addition to providing the location of grantee's facilities, grantee agrees to obtain facilities location information from other users of the public rights-of-way prior to grantee's construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operations and repair of the cable system facilities. 
Upon request by the town, the grantee shall furnish the town information relevant to such matters, which is prepared, maintained, and available in the ordinary course of business. 
SECTION 8

8.01  Grantee's obligation. Grantee shall pay, and by the acceptance of this franchise specifically agrees that it will pay, the following: 
A.  Damages and penalties.

B.  Expenses.

The town shall fully cooperate with the grantee. 
C.  Separate counsel. The town shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof, and the grantee shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if employed with the approval and consent of the grantee if representation of both the grantee and the town by the same attorney would be inconsistent with accepted canons of professional ethics. 
D.  Indemnification. It is the intent of this section and by its acceptance of this franchise, grantee specifically agrees that grantee, for itself and its agents, employees, subcontractors, and the agents and employees of said subcontractors, shall indemnify and hold the town, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, elected officials, successors and assigns harmless from all liability actions, causes of action, lawsuits, judgments, claims, damages, penalties, costs or fees, including attorney's fees and costs of defense, for any injury to or the death of any person or damage to or destruction of any property arising out of, resulting from or based upon, in whole or in part, any act or omission of grantee, its officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, and agents under this franchise, including without limitation the construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system. In the event that any action, suit or proceeding is brought or claim is made against the town based upon or arising out of any such act or omission of the grantee under this franchise, the town shall give notice in writing of such action, suit, proceeding or claim to the grantee. However, the failure of the town to promptly provide such notice in writing to grantee shall not relieve grantee of its duties and obligations under this section. The town shall not and does not by reason of this granting of this franchise, or any failure to act by the town which may impact the grantee's performance under this franchise, assume any liability of grantee whatsoever for injury to persons, damage to property, or penalties of any kind whatsoever.

Within 30 days after the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall provide to the town and maintain on file throughout the term of the franchise a certificate of insurance evidencing coverage as required in this section. At the town's request, such request to be based only on evidence which suggests that the certificates supplied are incorrect, a true and correct copy of the insurance policies shall be made available for the town's review at grantee's offices. If grantee elects to make such policies available for review outside of the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, metropolitan area, grantee shall pay the travel costs for a town representative to review such policies. The town will not be allowed to make copies of the insurance policies. 
9.06  Term. The insurance required by subsection 9.01 shall be kept in full force and effect by grantee during the existence of this franchise and thereafter until after the removal of all poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other conductors and fixtures incident to the maintenance and operation of grantee's cable system, should such removal be required by town council or undertaken by grantee. 
9.07  Issuing companies. Companies issuing the insurance policies shall have no recourse against the town for payment of any premiums or assessments which all are set at the sole risk of the grantee.

Within 60 days of receiving the request, grantee shall provide the town with information on any cable services that are offered in the comparable systems, but not being offered in the town. If the identified cable services are being offered by grantee or its affiliates to at least 50 percent of the total subscribers in the comparable systems, the town may request that grantee make available such cable services on the cable system in the town. Grantee shall inform the town within 60 days whether it intends to provide the requested cable service and to state a time frame for doing so. The parties recognize that grantee's refusal to provide a requested cable service may be a factor considered at renewal. The parties agree that, as of the effective date of this franchise, the town is not permitted to require the provision of specific video programming services pursuant to this subsection. 
10.05  Future upgrades. In the event grantee, either voluntarily, or under the terms of subsection 10.04, undertakes an upgrade or rebuild of the cable system during the term of this franchise, at least 30 days prior to the implementation of any upgrade and/or replacement activities, grantee shall provide to the town a written plan which shall include general information as to the construction necessary for the project, and the procedure or method grantee will employ to ensure minimal interruption of cable service.

Grantee shall deliver intact such closed captioning in the manner in which it arrives at the headend or from another origination source to the cable system. 
13.03  Interconnection. Grantee's subscriber cable system in the town may be interconnected with contiguous cable systems that are owned and operated by grantee or an affiliate, provided that such systems are served by the same headend that serves the town. 
SECTION 14  
14.0. - Public, educational, and government (PEG) access. 
14.01  Initial channels. As of the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall dedicate three channels for the carriage of PEG programming. The grantee shall ensure that such channels are of a technical quality comparable to any other channel offered over the cable system. 
14.02  Additional channels. Grantee shall make available up to one additional PEG channel (for a total of four PEG channels) under the procedures below. Grantee shall make available up to four additional PEG channels (for a total of eight PEG channels) under the procedures detailed in this section if all the video programming services offered by grantee on the cable system are in a digital format. 
If the town or one of its PEG channel designees believes that additional channel capacity is needed for PEG programming, the interested party may file a request with the town manager. In his/her deliberations, the town manager will consider supply and demand, and, in particular, the ability and resources to produce additional PEG programming, the interest of the community in the additional PEG programming as measured through a survey methodology that is mutually acceptable between the town and the grantee, consideration of the programming that would be displaced, how much programming is produced on the existing PEG channels, how much programming on the existing PEG channels is repeated, how much programming on the existing PEG channels is character-generated, whether it is feasible to cluster PEG programming into blocks of time such that the channel space can be compatibly shared between multiple PEG programming providers, and if several PEG programming providers should combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. 
Should the town manager find that the evidence exists to support the activation of an additional channel for PEG programming, then the town manager shall provide his/her decision in writing and grantee shall provide the channel within 90 days of receiving the request. Grantee may appeal the decision of the town manager to the town council. 
14.03  Underutilized PEG channels. Grantee and the town agree that it is their mutual goal to fully and efficiently use the channel capacity of the cable system, which may include allowing the grantee to use underutilized time on the PEG channels. If grantee believes that any PEG channel has underutilized time, grantee may file a request with the town manager to use that time. In response to the request, the town manager will consider a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, the community's needs and interests, and the source, quantity, type and schedule of the programming carried on the channel. The town manager will also consider, taking into account the mission of the PEG programming, whether it is feasible to cluster PEG programming into blocks of time such that the channel space can be compatibly shared between the peg programming provider and the grantee and/or if several PEG programming providers can combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. The town manager shall render his/her decision regarding the matter within 60 days of receiving the request. Should the town manager find that the PEG channel or portion of the channel may be used by the grantee, then grantee may begin using such time 90 days after receipt of the decision. The grantee's request shall not be unreasonably denied. Any permission granted pursuant to this subsection for use of a PEG channel or a portion thereof shall be considered temporary. 
At such time as a PEG programming provider believes that it has the resources and ability to utilize any PEG channel currently used by the grantee pursuant to this subsection, the PEG programming provider may request that the town return such PEG channel or portion of a PEG channel being used by the grantee to the PEG programming provider. In response to the request, the town will consider a combination of factors, including but not limited to, the community's needs and interests, the quantity and schedule of the programming the applicant proposes to carry on the PEG channel, and the applicant's ability and resources to acquire or produce the proposed PEG channel programming. The town will also consider whether it is feasible for the PEG programming provider to cluster programming into blocks of time such that the PEG channel can be compatibly shared between the PEG programming provider and the grantee and/or if several PEG programming providers can combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. The town shall render its decision regarding the matter within 90 days of receiving the request. Should the town find that the evidence exists to support the return of a PEG channel or portion of a PEG channel to the PEG programming provider, then the grantee shall surrender the requested time on the PEG channel within 90 days of receiving the decision. 
14.04  Delivery of PEG programming. PEG programming shall be produced, recorded and transmitted in a format which is compatible with the technology used by the cable system, whether audio, video, or other information (including, by way of example and not limitation, secondary audio, text, digital information, high definition signals and compressed signals). Such uses must be in furtherance of PEG programming uses. 
14.05  Management and control of PEG channels. The town or its designee shall at its discretion manage the use of all PEG channels and facilities and allocate and reallocate the PEG channels amongst public, educational and government access programming. The town may authorize a third party(ies) to control and manage the use of any or all PEG channels and related facilities provided by grantee under this franchise. The town or its designee may formulate rules for the operation of PEG channels consistent with this franchise and federal law. 
14.06  Routing of PEG channel content. Grantee shall continue to provide the necessary upstream channel capacity and equipment to originate PEG channel content from town hall for dissemination over the cable system to subscribers. Grantee shall provide the necessary upstream channel capacity and equipment to route PEG channel content from additional sites as identified by the town within 120 days of said request, provided that the town is responsible for the costs of all construction and equipment. Grantee shall provide the town with an estimate of the construction and equipment costs prior to beginning construction of any new return line. Grantee shall not be responsible for constructing any new return line until the town has approved such costs in writing. 
14.07  Relocation of access channels. Grantee will use reasonable efforts to minimize the movement of PEG channel assignments. Grantee shall provide the town with a minimum of 60 days' notice, and use its best efforts to provide 120 days' notice, prior to the time any PEG channel designation is changed, unless the change is required by federal law, in which case grantee shall give the town the maximum notice possible. In addition, grantee shall pay to the town an amount equal to the town's costs in remarketing the location of the PEG channels and managing the relocation administratively and technologically, up to a maximum of $0.50 per subscriber. Grantee shall only be allowed to recover such amounts paid to town as "external costs" (as that term is used in 47 C.F.R. section 76.922) if the movement of channels is required by federal, state or local law. Grantee, at grantee's expense, will place the town's notices of the channel change on or with one regular monthly billing, upon the town's request. Any new channel designations for the PEG channels provided pursuant to this franchise shall be in full compliance with FCC signal quality and proof-of-performance standards. 
14.08  Reception of PEG access signals. All PEG access channels provided for under this section shall be a part of the basic cable service. 
14.09  Technical assistance. Within one hour of a request from the town and/or its designee, identifying a problem and requesting assistance from the grantee regarding a PEG channel, grantee will respond by telephone to address the problem. Within four hours, grantee shall provide technical assistance or diagnostic services to determine whether or not a problem with a PEG channel is the result of matters for which grantee is responsible and, if so, grantee will take prompt corrective action. Such assistance will be at no charge to the town. 
14.10  PEG support. 
A.  [PEG, I-Net capital.] Grantee shall provide the town with a grant of $50,000.00 at such time as the town requests it during the first year of this franchise for PEG and I-Net capital.

Grantee shall be allowed to pass-through this payment to subscribers over the term of this franchise. 
B.  [Additional capital support.] Upon at least 90 days' advance written notice the town may require the grantee to provide an additional amount each month not to exceed $0.50 per month, per residential subscriber, as additional capital support for PEG programming or as capital support for the I-Net so long as the I-Net capability is provided by the grantee. Grantee shall be allowed to pass-through these payments to subscribers. 
C.  [PEG capital fee collection.] Grantee shall not be responsible for collecting or paying the PEG capital fee described in subsection 14.10, paragraph B or C on gratis accounts or for subscribers covered by bulk agreements. Each payment shall be due and payable no later than 30 days following the end of the quarter from when the PEG capital fee takes effect. The town may adjust the amount of the PEG capital fee on an annual basis (not to exceed the sum of the amounts specified in subsection 14.10, paragraphs B and C. 
D.  [Advertisements prohibited.] No PEG access channel may be used for the exhibition of any advertisement. For purposes of this section "advertisement" is defined as a message, announcement, or other programming material which is exhibited or otherwise transmitted in exchange for any remuneration and which is intended to (1) promote any service, facility, or product offered by any person who is engaged in such offering for profit; (2) to express the views of any person with respect to any matter of public importance or interest; or (3) to support or oppose any candidate for political office. 
E.  Current PEG equipment. Equipment that is currently provided to the town for PEG channel programming shall become the property of the town at no charge to the town or its subscribers. Equipment which is currently used to provide programming for the public access channel, will also become the property of the town, at no charge to the town or the subscribers. This equipment is listed on exhibit B. 
F.  Late payment. Grantee shall pay a late charge in an amount which is the greater of $100.00 or ten percent per annum, compounded daily, on PEG capital fee payments, or portions thereof, that are paid subsequent to the payment dates specified above. 
G.  The town shall have the authority to distribute and re-distribute the PEG capital fee in a manner that is deemed by the town to be in the best interest of the subscribers with respect to PEG programming and/or I-Net operations, in accordance with applicable law. 
SECTION 15  
15.0. - Emergency use of the cable system. 
15.01  Emergency or disaster. In accordance with and at the time required by the provisions of FCC regulations part 11, subpart D, section 11, and as such provisions may from time to time be amended, grantee shall install and maintain an emergency alert system (EAS) for use in transmitting pursuant to such regulations in the event of an emergency. Grantee shall provide the town with the ability to activate the EAS from multiple locations to override both audio and video of all programming services simultaneously during a period of emergency or disaster. Such emergency alert capability shall be operational throughout the term of this franchise. Grantee shall provide the appropriate training to town personnel as may be necessary to operate the equipment and facilities necessary to satisfy this provision of the franchise. 
15.02  Interconnection of EAS. In the event that the town enters into franchise agreements with other cable service providers, to the extent technically and legally feasible, grantee shall cooperate with the town to create a system and/or procedure to simultaneously activate the EAS over all cable systems operating in the town. The cost of such interconnection shall be borne by the other cable operators connecting to the grantee's facilities. Grantee assumes no liability for the failure of other cable service providers to provide EAS services. 
SECTION 16  
16.0. - Employment requirements. 
16.01  Equal opportunity in employment. Grantee shall afford equal opportunity in employment to all qualified persons. No person shall be discriminated against in employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 
SECTION 17  
17.0. - Other business activity. 
17.01  Limitations and restrictions. Subject to applicable state and federal law, this franchise only authorizes the grantee to provide those services or engage in business activities specifically identified herein. Such limitation is not a prohibition on grantee from providing services or engaging in business activities which the town cannot lawfully restrict or condition. 
SECTION 18  
18.0 - Payment to town. 
18.01  Amount and time. As compensation for the right, privilege, and franchise herein conferred, grantee shall pay to the town each year during the term of this franchise a sum equal to five percent of the grantee's gross revenue. Such payments shall be made quarterly within 45 days after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Accompanying the payment, grantee shall file a financial statement prepared according to generally accepted accounting practice showing in detail the gross revenues used in the computation of said payment. Such statement shall be signed by an officer or certified public accountant of the grantee. 
18.02  Right of inspection of records. The town shall have the right to inspect grantee's records showing the gross revenues from which payments to the town are computed and to audit and re-compute any and all amounts paid under this franchise. The town's right to audit and the grantee's obligation to retain records related to a franchise fee audit shall expire three years after each franchise fee payment has been made to the town. Pursuant to subsection 2.01, paragraph Q, subparagraph (i), as part of any franchise fee audit, the town shall specifically have the right to review records related to the allocation of revenue to cable services in the event grantee offers cable services bundled with non-cable services. 
18.03  Late payment charge. Grantee shall pay a late charge in an amount which is the greater of $100.00 or ten percent per annum, compounded daily, on franchise fee payments, or portions thereof, that are paid subsequent to the payment dates specified in subsection 18.01. The town shall provide written notice to the grantee that such payments have not been received in accordance with the dates specified in subsection 18.01, but such notice does not negate any late charge owed to the town beginning on the day following the required date of receipt under subsection 18.01. In the event the town identifies, as a result of an audit, amounts owed by the grantee from prior periods, the grantee shall pay a late charge of eight percent per annum, compounded quarterly, on the amounts identified, calculated from the date each portion of the underpayment was originally due until the date grantee remits the underpayment to the town. In the event that any audit or re-computation of fees results in an underpayment of greater than five percent (prior to the late charge) for the audit period, grantee shall reimburse the town for its costs to conduct the audit or re-computation. 
18.04  Acceptance. Payments received from the grantee under this section shall not in any way limit or impair any of the privileges or rights of the town, whether under this franchise or otherwise. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is the correct amount, nor shall acceptance be construed as a release of any claim that the town may have for additional amounts payable under the provisions of this section, subject to the limitations in subsection 18.02. 
18.05  Evasion of franchise fees. Any transaction or arrangement made for the purpose of or knowingly results in the evasion of franchise fees payable under this franchise is prohibited. 
18.06  Additional commitments not franchise fees. The franchise fee payable hereunder shall be exclusive of and in addition to all ad valorem taxes, special assessments, fees for municipal improvements, the PEG capital fee, and other lawful obligations of grantee to town. Although the total sum of franchise fee payments and additional commitments set forth elsewhere in this franchise may total more than five percent of grantee's gross revenues in any annual period, grantee agrees that the additional commitments herein are neither franchise fees as defined under any federal law in effect as of the effective date of this franchise, nor are the additional payments to be offset or credited against any franchise fee payments due to the town, nor do they represent an increase in franchise fees to be passed through to subscribers.

19.03  Quarterly reports. A report shall be filed by grantee with the town within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, or portion thereof during which the franchise is in effect. The material substance of the report shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the town. The information contained within the quarterly report shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  A summary of complaints received by grantee from the town during the quarter identifying the number and nature of the complaints. 
B.  A summary of the extent to which grantee has met the customer service standards included in exhibit A of this franchise. 
The quarterly reports may be submitted in conjunction with the payments to the town as required in subsection 18.01. 
19.04  Confidentiality. The town agrees to treat as confidential any books or records that constitute proprietary or confidential information under federal or state law, to the extent grantee makes the town aware of such confidentiality. Grantee shall be responsible for clearly and conspicuously stamping the word "Confidential" on each page that contains confidential or proprietary information, and shall provide a brief written explanation as to why such information is confidential under state or federal law. If the town believes it must release any such confidential books and records in the course of enforcing this franchise, or for any other reason, it shall advise grantee in advance so that grantee may take appropriate steps to protect its interests. If the town receives a demand from any person for disclosure of any information designated by grantee as confidential, the town shall, so far as consistent with applicable law, advise grantee and provide grantee with a copy of any written request by the party demanding access to such information within a reasonable time. Until otherwise ordered by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction, the town agrees that, to the extent permitted by state and federal law, it shall deny access to any of grantee's books and records marked confidential as set forth above to any person. 
SECTION 20  
20.0. - Regulation of rates. 
20.01  Town regulation of grantee's rates. The town council shall regulate, by ordinance, the rates for any and all of those cable services and related installations and equipment of grantee subject to regulation by the town, consistent with FCC rules and provisions of the Communications Act governing rate regulation. In such event the town council shall first prescribe by ordinance the procedure and standards to be followed and the extent and scope of such rate regulations, all of which matters shall be consistent with due process and shall conform to any and all of those federal and state laws, rules, and regulations then applicable. Subject to its authority to regulate rates the town shall have access to all books and records related to grantee's rates including bulk contract rate information, subject to applicable law. 
20.02  Notice of rates. Grantee shall provide written notice of its then current rates and charges for any and all of its cable services in the town in compliance with any timing requirements prescribed in FCC regulations. 
SECTION 21  
21.0. - Free drops and service. 
21.01  Free drops and service. Grantee shall, at no cost, continue to provide one outlet of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service to all town-owned and occupied buildings, schools, and public libraries where such service is provided as of the effective date of this franchise. For purposes of this subsection, "school" means all state-accredited K-12 public and private schools. In addition, grantee shall provide, at no cost, one outlet of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service to new or relocated, owned or leased and occupied town buildings, schools, and libraries where service is not being provided as of the effective date of this franchise upon request, and if the drop line from the feeder cable to such building does not exceed 150 feet, or if the town, school, or library agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 feet, including the cost of such excess labor and materials. Such obligation to provide free cable service shall not extend to areas of town buildings where the grantee would normally enter into a commercial contract to provide such cable service (e.g., golf courses, airport restaurants and concourses, and recreation center work out facilities). Outlets of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service provided in accordance with this subsection may only be used to distribute cable services throughout such buildings upon the express agreement of the grantee. Any cable service provided under this subsection may only be used for lawful purposes. 
SECTION 22  
22.0. - Prohibition of discriminatory or preferential practices. 
22.01  Rates, charges, and services. In its rates or charges, or in making available cable or in its rules or regulations, or in any other respect, grantee shall not make or grant preference or advantage to any subscriber or potential subscriber and shall not subject any such person to any prejudice or disadvantage. This provision shall not be deemed to prohibit promotional campaigns to stimulate subscriptions to the cable system or other legitimate uses thereof. 
SECTION 23  
23.0. - Non-exclusive franchise. 
23.01  Franchise non-exclusive. The rights, privileges, and franchise granted hereby are not exclusive and nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent town from granting any like or similar rights, privileges, and franchise to any other person within all or any portion of town. The town shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that any person providing video programming services and/or cable services does not enter into the public rights-of-way in the franchise area on terms or conditions materially more favorable or less burdensome to such person than those applied to the grantee pursuant to this franchise. 
23.02  Disputes. In the event that the town grants a franchise to another person to provide video programming and/or cable services in the town, grantee shall have no longer than three months from the date grantee receives a copy of such franchise to notify the town, in writing, of any alleged discrimination between this franchise and the burdens and rights provided in such other franchise. Failure to notify the town shall estop grantee from any further action related to allegations of discrimination regarding the granting of such franchise. This subsection is not intended to prevent grantee from any action related to the town's actual administration of such franchise that the grantee believes is discriminatory. 
SECTION 24  
24.0. - Material breach of franchise, notice and liquidated damages. 
24.01  Notice of default; opportunity to cure; public hearing. 
A.  Notice of default. The town shall notify the grantee, in writing, of an alleged failure to comply with a provision of this franchise, which notice shall specify the alleged failure with reasonable particularity. The grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to: 
(i)  Correct the violation before the town may take further action or with respect to any such violation, if by reason of the nature thereof such violation cannot with due diligence be wholly cured within such period of 30 days, then the 30-day period shall be extended for such period of time as may be necessary to complete the correction of the same with all due diligence, but in no event longer than 90 days unless a further extension of time is approved by the town council; or 
(ii)  Provide a written response to the town, presenting facts and arguments in refutation or excuse of such alleged failure. 
B.  [Public hearing.] If the town is unsatisfied with the grantee's response under subsection 24.01, paragraph A; the town shall hold a public hearing on the matter. Grantee must be given at least ten days' notice of the hearing. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to all the rights of due process consistent with the town procedures including but not limited to, the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. The grantee shall make available to the town, if requested, any records, documents or other information reasonably necessary to its consideration of the matter. Following the public hearing, the town may determine: 
(i)  Whether a failure to comply with a franchise provision has occurred; 
(ii)  Whether such failure is excusable; and 
(iii)  Whether such failure has been cured or will be cured by the grantee. After the hearing, grantee will be provided with a written copy of any action taken by the town council, along with supporting documents. 
C.  [Town options.] If the town determines that a failure to comply with a provision of the franchise has occurred and that such failure is not excusable and has not been or will not be cured by the grantee in a manner and in accordance with a schedule reasonably satisfactory to the town, then the town may take any actions provided in subsection 24.02. 
D.  In the event grantee fails to make a franchise fee payment as require by subsection 18.01, fails to make the PEG payments specified in subsection 14.10, paragraphs A through E, or fails to maintain insurance in accordance with section 9, the town is not required to conduct the public hearing identified in paragraph A above, but may proceed directly to subsection 24.02 for the procedures in paragraph A above. 
24.02  Town action in event of breach. In the event that grounds exist which give the town reason to believe that the grantee failed to comply with a material provision of this franchise, then the town may, at any time during the term of this franchise, to the extent lawful: 
A.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; 
B.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages from the grantee as compensation for such material breach; 
C.  Seek liquidated damages pursuant to subsection 24.03; and/or 
D.  In the case of breach of a material provision of the franchise or other material violation as set forth in subsections 25.01 and 25.02, seek to revoke the franchise pursuant to subsection 25.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town may not pursue monetary damages or liquidated damages for late payment of franchise fees in addition to the interest specified in subsection 18.03, or for late payment of the PEG capital fee in addition to the interest specified in subsection 14.10, paragraph F. 
24.03  Liquidated damages. In the event the town's selected course of action following the process set forth in subsections 24.01 and 24.02 is to impose liquidated damages, the town shall give grantee written notice of its intent, and a reasonable period of time following receipt of the notice, not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days unless a longer period is approved by the town council, to cure the alleged violation. If grantee remains in violation of the franchise following this cure period, the town may charge to and collect from the grantee the liquidated damages set forth below, with the liquidated damages beginning to accrue no earlier than the day following the end of the cure periods. The parties agree that actual damages that might be sustained by the town by reason of the breach by grantee of the provisions of this franchise set forth below, are uncertain and difficult of ascertainment, and that the sums set forth below would be reasonable compensation for such breach, and grantee promises to pay, and the town agrees to accept, such sums as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, in the event of such breach. Additionally such sums of money shall be considered liquidated damages due the town by grantee by reason of inconvenience to the public and because of public works supervision and maintenance and other town administrative time and involvement which resulted in the expenditure of public funds due to grantee's failure to comply with certain provisions in this franchise. Grantee covenants that any such sums paid to the town under this provision of the franchise shall not be included in the development of any rate, change, or price for services charged to subscribers. 
A.  For failure of grantee to provide any report, certificate or map to the town as required by this franchise, $50.00 per day. 
B.  For failure of grantee to respond, restore or repair the public rights-of-way within 48 hours of notice by town under subsection 7.03, $250.00 per day for every day following 48 hours after grantee's receipt of the notice. Should the town adopt any lawful and generally applicable ordinance governing the public rights-of-way which includes administrative fees for failure to restore the public rights-of-way, such fees in the ordinance shall apply to the grantee and supersede the ability of the town to collect liquidated damages under this provision of the franchise. 
C.  If town is required to relocate grantee's facilities under subsection 7.04, grantee shall pay $1,000.00 to the town in addition to reimbursement of the costs incurred by the town in relocating the facilities. Should the town adopt any lawful and generally applicable ordinance governing the public rights-of-way which includes administrative fees for town-performed relocation of grantee facilities, such fees in the ordinance shall apply to the grantee and supersede the ability of the town to collect liquidated damages under this provision of the franchise. 
D.  For failure of grantee to provide the PEG channels as required by subsections 14.01, 14.02, or 14.08, $100.00 per day. 
E.  For failure of grantee to provide the return lines required by subsection 14.06, $100.00 per day. 
F.  For failure of grantee to provide the town the ability to activate the EAS as required by subsection 15.01, $500.00 per day. 
G.  For failure of grantee to provide the notice of rates as required by subsection 20.02, $50.00 per day. 
H.  For failure to comply with the service extension requirements set forth in section 28, the greater of $250.00 per day or $1.00 per day per impacted subscriber. 
24.04  Force majeure. Other than its failure, refusal, or inability to pay its debts and obligations, including, specifically, the payments to town required by this franchise, grantee shall not be declared in default or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this franchise in those cases in which performance of such provision is prevented by reasons beyond its control. 
24.05  Reservation of rights. The rights reserved to the town under this section are in addition to all other rights of the town whether reserved by this franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any other right the town may have. 
SECTION 25  
25.0. - Revocation of franchise. 
25.01  General. In addition to all rights and powers of the town by virtue of this franchise or otherwise, the town reserves, as an additional and as a separate and distinct power, the right to revoke the franchise in accordance with the procedures specified herein if any of the following events occur or for any of the following reasons: 
A.  Grantee by act or omission substantially violates any material term, condition, or provision of this franchise and shall fail or refuse to effect material compliance following the notice and opportunity to cure specified under subsection 24.01; or 
B.  Grantee knowingly or willingly attempts to evade any material provision of this franchise; or 
C.  Repeated and substantial violation or willful disregard of: 
(i)  Town's lawful ordinances and regulations related to the public rights-of-way; or 
(ii)  The customer service standards in exhibit A; or 
(iii)  The cable system technical performance requirements in subsections 12.01 and 12.02. 
D.  The occurrence of any event which may reasonably lead to the foreclosure or other similar judicial or non-judicial sale of all or any material part of the cable system; or 
E.  Grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt or all or any part of grantee's facilities are sold under an instrument to secure a debt and are not redeemed by grantee within 30 days from the date of such sale; provided, however, this shall not be an event of termination or cancellation in the event of bankruptcy proceeding and the trustee, receiver, or debtor in possession agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this franchise; or 
F.  Grantee has been found by a court of law to have practiced any fraud or deceit in its conduct or relations under this franchise with the town, subscribers or potential subscribers. 
25.02  Material provisions. Material terms of this franchise include, but are not limited to: 
A.  The indemnification required by section 8. 
B.  The insurance required by subsection 9.01. 
C.  The channel capacity required by subsection 10.01.

25.03  Method of revocation. Should the town council determine, following the process set forth in subsections 24.01 and 24.02, that its selected course of action shall be to seek revocation of the franchise, the town shall give grantee written notice of such intent. The notice shall set forth the causes and reasons for the proposed revocation, shall advise grantee that it will be provided an opportunity to be heard by town regarding such proposed action before any such action is taken, and shall set forth the time, date, and place of the hearing. In no event shall such hearing be held less than 30 days following delivery of such notice to grantee. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to all rights of due process consistent with the town procedures, including but not limited to the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. Any such revocation of this franchise shall be by ordinance. 
25.04  Grantee may appeal town's decision. The grantee may appeal the town's decision to revoke the franchise to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the town's decision de novo and to modify or reverse such decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of the town. 
SECTION 26  
26.0. - Assignment of franchise. 
26.01  Town approval of assignment required. This franchise shall be a privilege personal to the grantee and shall not be assigned or transferred, or otherwise encumbered, without the prior consent of the town. Two exceptions to the requirement of town consent are: 
A.  If such assignment or transfer is to an affiliate of comparable technical and financial capability as well as proven experience in managing and operating cable systems; or 
B.  For a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness. Transfer to an affiliate shall mandate notification from grantee concerning the transfer or assignment. 
C.  For all other requests by grantee to assign or transfer this franchise, grantee shall provide appropriate written notification pursuant to FCC regulations. Within 30 days of receiving the request for transfer, the town shall notify the grantee in writing of the information it requires to determine the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee. If the town has not taken action on the grantee's request for transfer within 120 days after receiving such request, and provided the town has promptly received from grantee the information it requested in connection with the request, consent by the town shall be deemed given. The town may condition its consent to the transfer upon such terms and conditions reasonably related to the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the transferee. No assignment to any person shall be effective until the transferee has filed with the town an instrument in writing, duly executed, reciting the fact of such assignment, accepting the terms of this franchise, and agreeing to comply with all of the provisions hereof, subject to applicable law. 
26.02  Town approval of transfer of control required. The grantee shall promptly notify the town of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or disposition or acquisition by any other person in control of the grantee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the town shall have consented thereto provided that the town has acted within the time constraints required by law. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, disposition, or acquisition of control, the town may inquire into the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the prospective controlling party, but shall do so within 30 days of receipt of the requested transfer from the grantee. Grantee shall assist the town in such inquiry and will respond within ten days unless a longer time is reasonably necessary or allowed by law. 
SECTION 27  
27.0. - Failure of town to enforce franchise. 
27.01  No waiver of terms. The grantee shall not be excused from complying with each and all of the terms, conditions, and provisions of this franchise even though the town should upon one or more occasions fail to insist upon, require, or seek compliance with any such term, condition, or provision. 
SECTION 28  
28.0. - Service availability. 
28.01  Service availability. The grantee shall provide cable service throughout the entire franchise area, subject to the provisions below. 
28.02  Annexations. If the town annexes any contiguous territory which is being provided cable service by the grantee or its affiliates, the annexed area will be subject to the provisions of this franchise upon the effective date of the annexation; provided, however, that grantee shall be allowed a reasonable time under the circumstances to make any required modifications to the cable system, cable services, billing system, etc., as may be required to accommodate such change, and provided that if the area is serviced by an affiliate, a transfer of ownership of the cable system in that area to the grantee shall not be required by the town. If the annexed area is being provided comparable cable service by another provider, grantee shall have the right, but not the requirement, to extend its cable system to the annexed area. In the event that the annexed territory is contiguous and not being provided cable service by any provider, grantee agrees that it shall within 12 months extend its cable system into the newly annexed territory under the terms of subsection 28.03. In the event that the annexed area is not contiguous to the franchise area existing as of the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall not have the obligation to extend to such area. 
28.03  Extension policy. Within six months of a qualified request as described herein, grantee must extend and make cable service available to every lot or tract of land for which the owner or occupant thereof has requested cable service in all unserved areas having at least ten dwelling units constructed or planned for construction per 1,320 cable bearing strand feet or 25 dwelling units per cable bearing strand mile, as measured from the portion of the existing cable system which is to be extended. Extensions shall be at grantee's cost. For purposes of this section, "planned for construction" shall have the meaning of fully prepared lots. 
If more than 150 feet of distance lies between the nearest distribution cable and the point of connection of service to the property for which service is requested, the grantee may charge the potential subscriber non-standard installation charges as permitted by federal law. 
If the unserved area is a new underground development, grantee shall participate in joint trenching with the utilities installing service to the area, provided grantee is provided adequate notice and access to the trenches and is not otherwise prevented from participating due to conditions beyond its control. The ability of the grantee to participate in joint trenching shall not impact the grantee's requirement to provide extensions pursuant to this subsection. 
28.04  Contributions in aid of construction. In the event that potential subscribers request cable service in an area that does not meet the density requirements of subsection 28.03, the subscriber(s) will be given the alternative to provide a contribution in aid of construction of the cable system extension equal to three-fourths of the grantee's actual out-of-pocket costs to provide extension less than 1,320 cable bearing strand feet. That portion of any extension greater than 1,320 cable bearing feet shall be paid by the subscriber(s) at the grantee's actual out-of-pocket cost. In the event that any portion of the extension for which a subscriber has provided contribution in aid of construction ultimately meets the extension requirements in subsection 28.03, grantee shall reimburse all subscribers that have made such contributions in aid of construction, provided that such subscribers provide proof of the contribution in aid of construction to grantee. 
SECTION 29  
29.0. - Valuation. 
29.01  Purchase price of cable system. If the franchise is revoked for cause and the parties agree that the town may purchase the cable system, the town may purchase the cable system at an equitable price. If renewal of the franchise is lawfully denied and the parties agree that the town may purchase the cable system, the town may purchase the cable system at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. Should the parties fail to agree upon the then current fair market value, the same shall be determined in an appropriate proceeding filed in any court having jurisdiction. 
SECTION 30  
30.0. - Recourse, understanding, and construction. 
30.01  Requirements and enforcement. Except as expressly provided herein, grantee shall have no monetary recourse whatsoever against town of any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of the provisions or requirements of this franchise or because of the enforcement thereof by town or because of the lack of town's authority to grant all or any part of this franchise. 
30.02  Grantee's understanding. Grantee expressly acknowledges that in accepting this franchise, it relied solely upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of town to grant this franchise and that grantee was not induced to accept this franchise by any understanding, promise, or other statement, verbal or written, by or on behalf of town or by any third person concerning any term or condition not expressed herein. 
30.03  Construction of franchise. By acceptance of this franchise, grantee acknowledges that it has carefully read the provisions hereof and is willing to and does accept all of the risks of the meanings of such. 
SECTION 31  
31.0. - Acceptance of franchise. 
31.01  Method of acceptance. Within 30 days from the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall file with the town secretary a written statement in the following form signed in its name and behalf:

31.02  Acceptance of franchise not a waiver. Acceptance of this franchise by grantee shall not constitute a waiver by it of any of its rights.  
32.0. - Severability. 
32.01  Provisions severable. If any provision, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this franchise is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this franchise. It is the intent of town in adopting this franchise that no portion or provision thereof shall become inoperative or fail by reason of any invalidity or unconstitutionality of any other portion or provision, and to this end all provisions; of this franchise are declared to be severable. 
SECTION 33  
33.0. - Conflicts. 
33.01  Conflicts. All ordinances and provisions of the town that are in conflict with this franchise shall be and same are hereby repealed, and all ordinances and provisions of ordinances of said town not so repealed are retained in full force and effect.

EXHIBIT A 
 
1.1.A. - Customer service standards. 
1)  Section 1: Definitions. 
A.  Normal operating conditions: Those service conditions which are within the control of the grantee. Those conditions which are not within the control of the grantee include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, labor strikes or slowdowns, telephone network outages, interruption of electric power service which is not a direct result of the grantee's actions, and severe or unusual weather conditions. Those conditions which ordinarily are within the control of the grantee include, but are not limited to, special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate adjustments, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, backup power during power outages, changes in billing cycles, changes in channel line-ups that are within grantee's control, construction, rebuilds, maintenance (including repairs related thereto) and/or upgrade of the cable system. 
B.  Outage: A service interruption affecting multiple subscribers in a contiguous area that has the same source problem. 
C.  Service call: The action taken by the grantee to correct a service interruption affecting an individual subscriber. 
D.  Service interruption: The loss of picture or sound on one or more channels. 
E.  Standard installation: Installations where the length of the drop is up to 150 feet.  
Section 2. - Telephone availability. 
A.  The grantee shall maintain a toll-free number to respond to all calls and inquiries from subscribers in the franchise area and/or town residents regarding cable service. Grantee representatives trained and qualified to answer questions related to cable service in the franchise area must be available to receive requests for service calls or report outages 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and other inquiries at least 45 hours per week, including some evening and weekend hours. Grantee representatives shall identify themselves by name when answering this number. 
B.  The grantee's telephone numbers shall be listed, with appropriate description (e.g. administration, customer service, billing, repair, etc.), in the directory published by the local telephone company or companies serving the franchise area. 
C.  In the event that the grantee chooses to use an automated response unit ("ARU") or a voice response unit ("VRU") to distribute calls, the system shall have as a first tier menu option (not including a routing option for foreign language), an option "for all other inquiries." If a foreign language routing option is provided, and the subscriber does not enter an option, the menu will default to the first tier menu of English options. 
After the first tier menu (not including a foreign language routing option) has run through twice, if customers do not select any option, the ARU or VRU will forward the call to a queue for a live representative. The grantee may reasonably substitute this requirement with another method of handling calls from customers who do not have touch-tone telephones. 
The total elapsed time between when a subscriber's call is first answered by an ARU or VRU to the end of the last tier menu shall not be longer than 90 seconds. For purposes of this subsection, the "last tier menu" is the last tier before the subscriber is routed to a live representative, or specific information is given to the subscriber, such as instructions for troubleshooting or directions to an office. 
The town may review the options provided to callers and recommend to the grantee that additional options be provided. The grantee shall consider the town's recommendations. 
D.  Under normal operating conditions, calls received by the grantee shall be answered within 30 seconds after the subscriber has selected their final menu option. The grantee shall meet this standard for 90 percent of the calls it receives, as measured on a calendar quarter basis. Measurement of this standard shall include all calls received by the grantee, whether they are answered by a live representative, automated attendant, or abandoned before completion. 
If the grantee does not meet the 90 percent standard described in this paragraph D. during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the town against the grantee as follows: 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 percent and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $750.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 65 percent and less than 75 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $2,500.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs less than 65 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $5,000.00. 
For any consecutive quarter(s) in which the grantee performs at a level below 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town the amount listed above for the most recent quarter, plus the amount paid to the town for the previous quarter. For example, if the grantee performs at 79 percent one quarter and 60 percent in the next quarter, the grantee shall pay the town $2,500.00 for the first quarter and $7,500.00 [$5,000.00 for the most recent quarter plus $2,500.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, callers to the grantee shall receive a busy signal less than three percent of the time during any calendar quarter. 
F.  Not more than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, the grantee shall report to the town the following for all call centers receiving calls from subscribers except for temporary telephone numbers set up for national promotions: 
 Total number of calls received by the grantee 
 Number of calls answered by these categories: live representative, automated attendant, and abandoned 
 Number of calls answered within 30 seconds 
 Percentage of calls answered within 30 seconds 
 Percentage of time all trunks were busy 
The material substance of the report shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the town. 
If the town does not receive the quarterly calls report when due, the town shall give notice to the grantee. The grantee shall be assessed liquidated damages in the amount of $50.00 per day for every day following receipt of the notice that the report is not provided to the town. The grantee shall not be assessed liquidated damages for failure to report on statistics which cannot be produced for reasons outside of its control, provided that the grantee supplies an explanation to the town as to why the statistics required herein could not be produced. 
G.  The grantee shall notify the town's designee as promptly as possible, by any available means, whenever there is a situation that prevents all subscribers from being able to reach the grantee by telephone.

Section 3. - Service centers. 
A.  The grantee shall provide the town with a written list of service centers and hours of operation for each location that subscribers can visit for any of the following functions, and notify the town of any subsequent changes in either location or hours 30 days in advance.

Section 4. - Installations and service appointments. 
A.  All installations will be in accordance with FCC rules, including but not limited to, appropriate grounding, connection of equipment to ensure reception of cable service, and the provision of required consumer information and literature to adequately inform the subscriber about the utilization of the grantee-supplied equipment and cable services. 
B.  Under normal operating conditions, standard installations shall be performed within seven days after an order has been placed, except for those subscribers who specifically request an installation date later than seven days after order placement. 
The company shall meet this standard for 90 percent of the standard installations it performs, as measured on a calendar quarter basis, excepting out customer requests for connection later than seven days after order placement. 
If the grantee does not meet the 90 percent standard described in this paragraph B. during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the town against the grantee as follows: 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 percent and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $750.00.

For any consecutive quarter(s) in which the grantee performs at a level below 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town the amount listed above for the most recent quarter, plus the amount paid to the town for the previous quarter. For example, if the grantee performs at 79 percent one quarter and 60 percent in the next quarter, the grantee shall pay the town $2,500.00 for the first quarter and $7,500.00 [$5,000.00 for the most recent quarter plus $2,500.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter. 
In addition, any individual subscriber who does not have their standard installation completed within the seven-day period shall be entitled to receive a free standard installation upon request, except for those subscribers who request installation later than seven days after order placement. 
C.  The grantee shall provide the town with a report within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, noting the following: 
 Number of total standard installations completed for the quarter, excluding those requested outside of the seven-day period by the subscriber. 
 Number of standard installations completed within the seven-day period. 
 Number of standard installations not completed within the seven-day period. 
 Percentage of standard installations completed within the seven-day period, excluding those requested outside of the seven-day period by the subscriber. 
At the grantee's option, the measurements and reporting above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The grantee shall notify the town of such a change not less than 30 days in advance. 
D.  The grantee will offer subscribers "appointment window" alternatives for installations, service calls, and other installation activities of a maximum four-hour scheduled time block between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. except during months where available light does not permit appointments after 6:00 p.m. At the grantee's discretion, the grantee may offer subscribers appointments other than these four-hour time blocks if agreeable to the subscriber. The grantee may offer to schedule subscriber appointments for a specific time and shall schedule the subscriber to be the first call of the day or last call of the day if requested by the subscriber and warranted by the circumstances. The grantee shall also perform some service calls outside of the hours specified above in the evenings and on weekends. 
E.  At the request of the subscriber, the grantee will call the subscriber prior to an installation or service call appointment. The call shall be made by the grantee at the approximate time and to the telephone number requested by the subscriber. 
F.  At the time this franchise was entered into, grantee was voluntarily participating in the industry "on-time guarantee" program. Under the terms of that program, if the grantee does not arrive for an installation or service call appointment within the scheduled time frame agreed to with the subscriber, the subscriber is entitled to receive either a free standard installation in the event of an installation appointment, or a $20.00 credit in the event of a missed service call appointment. Calling a subscriber during the appointment window does not negate the subscriber's entitlement to credit for a missed appointment. The grantee will participate in this program and reserves the right to substitute another customer service program for the "on-time guarantee" at its discretion, provided that the subscriber benefits are reasonably comparable to those provided by the current program. 
G.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber after 6:00 p.m. on the business day prior to the day of the scheduled appointment. 
H.  If the grantee's representative is running late for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the grantee will document an effort to contact the subscriber directly. If, however, the subscriber is unavailable at the time the contact attempt is made, the grantee will attempt at least a second documented contact during the previously agreed upon appointment window or before the specifically scheduled time. The appointment will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is mutually agreeable. 
I.  If it is necessary to place a temporary drop on the ground, the grantee shall bury the temporary drop within ten business days, under normal operating conditions. The ten-day period shall be extended for days that the grantee is unable to bury the drop due to unfavorable weather conditions or is unable to gain access to a temporary drop located on private property. If grantee fails to bury the drop within this authorized time period, grantee shall pay the town $100.00 a day for each day that a drop remains on the ground.  
Section 5. - Service interruptions and outages. 
A.  The grantee shall make repairs promptly, and interrupt cable service only as necessary and for the shortest time period possible. Unless otherwise required by law or approved by the town, the grantee will not schedule routine testing or maintenance which would cause a service interruption or outage on Friday, Saturday or Sunday night. 
B.  The grantee shall promptly notify the town of any significant outage of the cable system. For the purposes of this section, a significant outage of the cable system shall mean any service interruption lasting at least four continuous hours that affects at least ten percent of the subscribers in the franchise area. 
C.  The grantee shall exercise its best efforts to limit any outage for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, or constructing the cable system. Except in an emergency or other situation necessitating a more expedited or alternative notification procedure, the grantee may schedule an outage for a period of more than four hours during any 24-hour period only after the town and each affected subscriber in the town have been given 15 days' prior notice of the proposed outage. 
D.  Technicians employed by the grantee who are capable of responding to outages must be available to respond 24 hours a day, seven days per week. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee must respond to a call or written notice from a subscriber regarding a service interruption within 24 hours. The grantee must begin actions to correct all other cable service problems the next business day after notification by the subscriber or the town of a cable service problem. 
F.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall complete service calls within 72 hours after being notified of a service interruption, not including situations where the subscriber is not reasonably available for a service call to correct the service interruption within the 72-hour period. 
G.  The grantee shall meet the standard in paragraph F. of this section for 90 percent of the service calls it completes, as measured on a quarterly basis. 
If the grantee fails to meet this standard during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the town against the grantee as follows: 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 [percent] and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $750.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 65 percent and less than 75 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $2,500.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs less than 65 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $5,000.00. 
For any consecutive quarter(s) in which the grantee performs at a level below 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town the amount listed above for the most recent quarter, plus the amount paid to the town for the previous quarter. For example, if the grantee performs at 79 percent one quarter and 60 percent in the next quarter, the grantee shall pay the town $2,500.00 for the first quarter and $7,500.00 [$5,000.00 for the most recent quarter plus $2,500.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter. 
H.  The grantee shall provide the town with a report within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, noting the following:

 Number of service calls completed within the 72-hour period. 
 Percentage of service calls completed within the 72-hour period, not including service calls where the subscriber was reasonably unavailable for a service call within the 72-hour period 
 At the grantee's option, the measurements and reporting above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The grantee shall notify the town of such a change at least 30 days in advance. 
I.  Within 30 days following the end of each calendar year, grantee shall provide a report of all service calls for the year by category. 
J.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall provide credit upon subscriber request to affected subscriber(s) when there is an outage or service interruption of all channels for a period of four consecutive hours or more. The credit for such an outage shall equal, at a minimum, a proportionate amount of the affected subscriber(s) current monthly bill. In order to qualify for the credit, the subscriber must promptly report the problem and allow the grantee to verify the outage if requested by the grantee. 
K.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall provide a credit upon subscriber request to any subscriber experiencing an outage or service interruption of any specific cable service or channel for a period of four consecutive hours or more. The credit shall equal, at a minimum, a proportionate amount of the affected cable services. In order to qualify for the credit, the subscriber must promptly report the problem and allow the grantee to verify the outage if requested by the grantee. 
L.  Under normal operating conditions, if an outage affects all video programming cable services in an area which serves more than ten percent of total grantee subscribers in the franchise area, for more than 24 consecutive hours, the grantee shall issue an automatic credit to the affected subscribers in the amount of the value of basic plus expanded basic service for the proportionate time the cable service was out. Such credit will be reflected on subscriber billing statements within 45 days following the outage. Such credit under this provision does not negate the subscriber's right to request additional credit under items J. and K. herein.  
Section 6. - Customer complaints. 
A.  The grantee shall maintain a written log or an equivalent stored in computer memory and capable of access and reproduction in printed form, of all cable-related subscriber contacts which result in a service call. Such log shall, at a minimum, list the date and time of such contact, the nature of the complaint, and when and what actions were taken by the grantee in response thereto. Such log shall be kept at the grantee's office in or near the franchise area, for a period of at least three years and shall be available for inspection during regular business hours by town upon request, subject to section 631 of the Cable Act regarding subscriber privacy. 
Additionally, the grantee shall maintain a written or electronic log of every subscriber complaint referred by the town, including the dates, times and detailed information related to the complaint and resolution. 
If the town receives a pattern of complaints from subscribers which indicates a recurring problem, town may require the grantee to maintain a manual or electronic log of the problem being tracked until such time as the calls to the town are reasonably reduced. 
B.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall resolve subscriber complaints referred by the town within 72 hours. The grantee shall notify the town of those matters that necessitate an excess of 72 hours to resolve, but those matters must be finally resolved within ten days of the initial complaint. The town may require reasonable documentation to be provided by the grantee to substantiate the request for additional time to resolve the problem. If the grantee fails to resolve a complaint within the required 72 hours (or extended period), the grantee shall pay to the town $100.00 dollars per day for each day the complaint is not resolved within the specified time frame. 
For purposes of this subsection, "resolve" means that the grantee shall perform those actions which, in the normal course of business, are necessary to respond to the subscriber's problem. 
C.  The grantee's customer service representatives shall have the authority to provide credit for interrupted cable service or any of the other credits, to waive fees, and to schedule service appointments. Any difficulties that cannot be resolved by the customer service representative shall be referred to the appropriate supervisor who shall contact the customer within four hours and resolve in accordance with this section.  
Section 7. - Billing. 
A.  Subscriber bills must be itemized, in accordance with cable services purchased by subscribers and related equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, credits, and late charges.

The billing period is the time period for which cable services are being billed. For example, if the customer's billing period is from the first to the thirty-first of the month, the due date shall not be earlier than the fifteenth day of the month. 
D.  A specific due date shall be listed on the bill of every subscriber whose account is current. Delinquent accounts may receive a bill that lists the due date as "upon receipt"; however, the current portion of that bill shall not be considered past due except in accordance with B. and C. above. 
E.  Any subscriber who, in good faith, disputes all or part of any bill shall have the option of withholding the disputed amount without disconnect or late fees being assessed until the dispute is resolved, provided that: 
* The subscriber pays all undisputed charges; 
* The subscriber provides notification of the dispute to grantee within five days of the due date; and 
* The subscriber cooperates in determining the accuracy and/or appropriateness of the charges in dispute. 
It shall be within the grantee's sole discretion to determine when the dispute has been resolved; however, the town has the right to determine if the grantee has met its obligations to the subscriber under this subsection. 
F.

The town recognizes that only option (4) above is available as of the effective date of this franchise for subscription to the grantee's cable internet service, but that the grantee is taking steps to make options (1) through (3) available in the near future. The town reserves the right to enforce the requirement above for the cable internet service if the grantee has not voluntarily made available the other payment options within 18 months of the effective date of this franchise.  
Section 8. - Deposits, refunds and credits. 
A.  The grantee may require refundable deposits from subscribers with (1) a poor credit or poor payment history, (2) who refuse to provide credit history information to the grantee, or (3) who rent subscriber equipment from the grantee, so long as such deposits are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis. The maximum deposit the grantee may charge subscribers with poor credit or poor payment history or who refuse to provide credit information is the average of a typical subscriber's bill over the most recent six-month period. The maximum deposit the grantee may charge for subscriber equipment is the cost (not depreciated value) of the equipment that the grantee would need to purchase to replace the equipment rented to the subscriber. 
B.  The grantee shall pay simple annual interest at five percent on deposits collected for equipment that are unrelated to poor credit or poor payment history if the deposit is held by the grantee for a period in excess of one year, and the subscriber's account is current at the time the deposit is refunded.

C.  Under normal operating conditions, refund checks will be issued within 45 days following the resolution of the event giving rise to the refund. 
D.  Credits for cable service will be issued no later than the subscriber's next bill which is printed following the determination that a credit is warranted, and the credit is approved and processed. Such approval and processing shall not be unreasonably delayed. 
E.  Bills shall be considered paid when appropriate payment is received by the grantee or its authorized agent. Appropriate time considerations shall be included in the grantee's collection procedures to assure that payments due have been received before late notices or termination notices are sent.

A.  The grantee shall not, except to the extent expressly permitted by law, impose any fee or charge for service calls to a subscriber's premises to perform any repair or maintenance work related to grantee equipment necessary to receive cable service, except where any such problem which was caused by a negligent or wrongful act of the subscriber (including, but not limited to a situation in which the subscriber reconnects grantee equipment incorrectly), or by the failure of the subscriber to take reasonable precautions to protect the grantee's equipment (for example, a dog chew). 
B.  Any late fee that grantee assesses on subscribers in the town for delinquent payment shall not exceed the prevailing late fee assessed by grantee or its affiliates on cable service within the entire Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, metropolitan area.

C.  No late fee may be assessed on cable services until one month following the date of the bill on which the charges first appeared. The amount of the late fee shall be subject to any applicable federal, state or local consumer protection laws or other lawful and applicable regulations.  
Section 10. - Disconnection /denial of service. 
A.  The grantee shall not terminate cable service for nonpayment of a delinquent account unless the grantee provides a notice of the delinquency and impending termination at least 15 days prior to the proposed termination.

The notice of delinquency and impending termination may be part of a billing statement. 
B.  In the event that cable service is terminated pursuant to a bulk contract and the grantee is permitted to enter into cable service arrangements with individual dwellings previously serviced under such contract, the grantee shall not hold such individual subscriber(s) liable for any nonpayment or underpayments related specifically to the contract. Subscribers may be held accountable for payment for cable services subscribed to during the period of the contract, which were in addition to the cable services provided pursuant to the contract. 
C.  Cable service terminated in error must be restored without charge within 24 hours of notice. If subscriber was billed for the period during which cable Service was terminated in error, an automatic credit shall be issued to subscriber if the service interruption was reported by the subscriber. The amount of the automatic credit shall be in accordance with section 5, paragraph J. of these customer service standards. 
D.  Subject to section 23 of this franchise, the grantee shall furnish and maintain cable services to each person who makes a request to receive any grantee-offered cable service. Nothing in these standards shall limit the right of the grantee to deny cable service for nonpayment of previously provided cable services, refusal to pay any required deposit, theft of cable service, damage to the grantee's equipment, or abusive and/or threatening behavior toward the grantee's employees or representatives. 
E.  No period of notice prior to requested termination of service can be required of subscribers by the grantee. No charge shall be imposed upon the subscriber for or related to total disconnection of cable service, or for any cable service delivered after the effective date of the disconnect request (unless there is a delay in returning grantee equipment). If the subscriber fails to specify an effective date for disconnection, the subscriber shall not be responsible for cable service received after the day following the date the disconnect request is received by the grantee.

Unless otherwise specified, "cable system" is used in this franchise to refer to the particular cable system authorized under the franchise and operated by the grantee within the franchise area. 
G.  Channels. A portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is capable of delivering a video signal, an audio signal, a voice signal or a data signal. A channel can be either "downstream," in which case the signal is transmitted by grantee from grantee's facilities to subscriber premises, or "upstream," in which case the signal is transmitted in the reverse direction from subscriber premises to grantee's facilities. For purposes of rate regulation, the town retains all lawful authority, and grantee retains any lawful rights, to interpret the definition of "channels" in a manner consistent with this franchise and regulations promulgated by the FCC. 
H.  Control. The actual working control of a grantee in whatever manner exercised. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the purposes hereof, a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred at any point in time when there is: 
(i)  A change in working or effective voting control, in whatever manner effectuated, of the grantee; 
(ii)  An agreement of the holders of voting stock or rights of the grantee which effectively vests or assigns policy decision-making in any person other than the grantee; or 
(iii)  A sale, assignment or transfer of more than 35 percent of the shares or interest in the grantee. 
I.  Days. Calendar days unless otherwise specified. 
J.  Drop. An aerial or underground portion of the cable system, which extends from the tap to the demarcation point of the subscriber's residence or business.

P.  Grantee. Advantex Communications/Grande Communications, or any person who succeeds Advantex Communications/Grande Communications, in accordance with the provisions of this franchise. 
Q.  Gross revenue. Any and all revenue, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, received by grantee, its affiliates who are cable operators (as defined by section 602(5) of the Communications Act) of the cable system, or other persons providing cable service over the cable system that are classified as cable operators pursuant to section 602(5) of the Communications Act, which is derived from or attributable to the operation of the grantee's cable system to provide cable services, regardless of whether the grantee or other third-party provider actually bills for the cable service. By way of illustration and not limitation, gross revenue includes all fees charged subscribers for any and all cable services provided by grantee over the cable system such as basic cable service revenues, expanded basic cable service revenues, pay cable service revenues, revenues resulting from connection or reconnection to the cable system in order to receive cable services, revenues resulting from the lease, rental, use, repair, or servicing of cable system equipment used to receive cable service, revenues from late, delinquent, or other administrative fees applied to cable services, and franchise fees assessed on cable services which are collected from subscribers. Gross revenues shall also include advertising revenues received by the grantee which are attributable to cable services delivered over the cable system in the town, revenues resulting from the lease, use or rental of channels or channel capacity to provide cable services, revenues received by the grantee from commissions on sales from shopping cable services, and revenues received from programmers providing cable service programming over the cable system. Gross revenues shall not include those payments described in subsection 14.10 of this franchise. 
(i)  The town recognizes that, in the future, grantee may allocate revenue between cable services (which are subject to the franchise fee) and non-cable services (which are not subject to the franchise fee but may be subject to other fees and/or taxes), when these two types of service are bundled together in a discounted package offered to subscribers. Due to the uncertainties that currently exist, both in the business and regulatory environment on this issue, the town and the grantee hereby reserve all rights, claims, defenses and remedies regarding the town's authority to impose and/or enforce requirements related to the revenue allocation methodology to be used when cable services and non-cable services are offered to subscribers in a discounted package, for the purpose of calculating franchise fee payments. 
(ii)  In the event that the town believes that grantee has unlawfully or unfairly allocated revenue between cable services and non-cable services for the purpose of calculating franchise fee payments, the town and the grantee shall meet upon advance notice from the town to discuss the allocation methodology. If the town and the grantee cannot agree on the matter within a reasonable period of time, the town and grantee may submit the matter to a mutually agreeable third party for mediation. The cost of the mediation shall be shared equally between the town and the grantee. At any time, either the town or the grantee can bring the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction, or pursue any other remedies available to them in this franchise or by law. Unless otherwise approved by the town, the venue for any judicial dispute between the town and grantee arising out of this provision shall be the Civil District Court, Denton County, Texas, or the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas. If the court determines that the allocation of revenue to cable services violates this franchise, then the town would be entitled to the benefits of such a decision. 
(iii)  The parties intend for the definition of gross revenue to be as inclusive as possibly consistent with existing applicable law. If there is a change in federal law subsequent to the effective date of this franchise, such change shall not impact this gross revenues definition in such a way to reduce gross Revenues unless the change specifically preempts the affected portion of the definition above. 
R.  Institutional network. A portion of the cable system constructed and maintained by grantee and which is only available for private, non-commercial use by governmental and/or educational entities pursuant to agreement between the grantee and the town. 
S.  Pay cable services. The delivery over the cable system of cable service programming to subscribers for a fee or charge over and above the charge for basic cable service or expanded basic cable service on a per program, per-channel, per connection or per-time period of connection basis. 
T.  PEG channels. All public access channels, educational access channels and government access channels, collectively. 
U.  PEG programming. Programming produced for and exhibited over the PEG channels. 
V.  Person. Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization of any kind. 
W.  Public access channel. The non-commercial channel(s) on the cable system reserved for public users and used in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the town, or its designee. 
X.  Public rights-of-way. The surface, the air space above the surface, and the area below the surface of any public street, highway, lane, path, alley, sidewalk, boulevard, drive, bridge, tunnel, easement or similar property in which the town holds any property interest or exercises any rights of management or control and which, consistent with the purposes for which it was acquired or dedicated, may be used for the installation and maintenance of a cable system. No reference in this franchise to a public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the town that its interests or other rights in such property are sufficient to permit its use for the installation and maintenance of a cable system, and the grantee shall be deemed to gain only those rights which the town has the undisputed right and power to give. 
Y.  Subscriber. Any person lawfully receiving cable service delivered by means of the grantee's cable system.

The town agrees that any public utility owning or controlling such poles or underground conduits may, without amendment to its franchise, allow, and is encouraged to allow, grantee to make such use thereof pursuant to any agreement reached between such utility and grantee. Nothing in this franchise shall authorize grantee to attach any part of its cable system to any town-owned conduits or facilities until grantee has entered into a separate agreement with the town, supported by independent consideration, for such rights of attachment or use. 
3.03  Additional services. By granting this franchise, the town does not waive, and specifically retains, any right to regulate and receive compensation as allowed by law for services offered over the cable system which are not cable services. Upon request, grantee shall inform the town of any non-cable service offered over the cable system of which grantee is aware. Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to limit any lawful authority of the town to impose a tax, fee, or other assessment of any kind on any person (other than the grantee, its affiliates, or other persons which are cable operators of the cable system pursuant to section 602(5) of the Communications Act), with respect to cable service or other communications service provided by such person over the cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received by the grantee, its affiliates or other persons who are cable operators of the cable system pursuant to section 602(5).

The grantee shall pay the amounts billed within 30 days. The parties agree that any amounts paid pursuant to this subsection are not franchise fees and fall within one or more of the exceptions to the definition of franchise fee under federal law. Nothing in this subsection is intended to affect in any way (by expansion or contraction) grantee's rights under applicable law governing rates. 
SECTION 4  
4.0 - Term, evaluation, and renewal.

In the event grantee, after written notice, fails or refuses to act within 15 days of such written notice, town shall have the power to remove or abate the same at the expense of grantee, all without compensation or liability for damages to grantee except in instances where the damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents.

7.01  Use. All structures, wires, cables, equipment, and facilities erected or maintained by grantee within the town shall be located as to cause minimum interference with the proper and intended use of the public rights-of-way and with the rights or reasonable convenience of the owners or occupants of property which adjoins any of such public rights-of-way. The location of all poles, towers, anchors, wires, cables, electronic conductors, conduits, manholes and other structures and appurtenances in, over, under, along, and across the present and future public rights-of-way in the town shall be fixed under the supervision of the town or an authorized agent appointed by the town. Grantee agrees to comply with all other town laws, rules, or ordinances that govern the use of public rights-of-way that currently exist or may be applicable during the term of this franchise, provided that such are promulgated under the town's lawful police powers. In the event that there is conflict between requirements of this franchise and other generally applicable and lawful town ordinances governing grantee's ability to use the public rights-of-way, the stricter provisions shall apply. 
7.02  Excavation. Grantee may excavate only for the construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, and maintenance of all or a portion of its facilities used to provide cable service under this franchise. Except in the case of emergency maintenance, grantee shall provide the town written notice within 15 days of any proposed disturbance to any public rights-of-way prior to the commencement thereof. Grantee shall provide the town with notice within 24 hours following any emergency maintenance that disturbed the public rights-of-way. Owners or occupants of adjoining property shall be given reasonable notice. When the grantee shall make or cause to be made excavations or shall place obstructions in any public rights-of-way, the public shall be protected by barriers and lights placed, erected, and maintained by the grantee in accordance with any existing or future town, state, or federal requirements. No public rights-of-way shall be encumbered by construction, maintenance, removal, restoration, or repair work by grantee for a longer period than shall be necessary to execute such work. 
7.03  Restoration. The surface of any public rights-of-way disturbed by grantee in laying, constructing, maintaining, operating, using, extending, removing, replacing, or repairing its cable system shall be restored by grantee as soon as reasonably possible, but in no instance greater than 30 days after the completion of the work under normal operating conditions, at its cost and expense, to as good a condition as before the commencement of the work.

In the event restoration is scheduled to take longer than 30 days for any other reason, grantee shall provide the town with written notice as to the reason(s) for the delay. Such restoration shall be maintained by grantee to the satisfaction of the town for one year from the date of completion of such restoration work. If there is an unreasonable delay by grantee in restoring and maintaining public rights-of-way after such excavations or repairs have been made, town shall have the right, following written notice to grantee to which grantee has 48 hours in which to respond, to restore or repair the same and to require grantee to pay to the town the reasonable cost of such restoration or repair all without compensation or liability for damages to the grantee unless such damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. In the event town determines that grantee's use of any of town's public rights-of-way as set forth in this franchise poses an immediate danger to the health, safety or general welfare of the public, town shall have the right to restore or repair same and shall require grantee to pay to the town the reasonable costs incurred regarding same, all without compensation or liability for damages to the grantee unless the damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. 
7.04  Relocation. Whenever by reason of the construction, repair, maintenance, relocation, widening, raising, or lowering of the grade of any public rights-of-way by the town or by the location or manner of construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of any public property, structure, or facility by the town, it shall be deemed necessary by the town for grantee to move, relocate, change, alter, or modify any of its facilities or structures, such change, relocation, alteration, or modification shall be promptly made by grantee, when directed in writing to do so by the town. Grantee shall pay the cost of such relocation unless there are funds allocated to affected users of the public right-of-way, including grantee, for the reimbursement of such costs. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the town shall make application for such funds on behalf of the grantee, upon request of grantee, if grantee cannot make such application itself. In the event grantee, after such notice, fails or refuses to commence, pursue, or complete such relocation work within a reasonable time, the town shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to remove or abate such structures or facilities and to require grantee to pay to the town the reasonable cost of such removal or abatement, all without compensation or liability for damages to grantee unless such damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. 
7.05  Temporary removal of wire for building moving. Upon written request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the town, grantee shall remove, raise, or lower its wires and cables temporarily to permit the moving of houses, buildings, or other bulky structures. The reasonable expense of such temporary removal, raising, or lowering shall be paid by the benefited person, and grantee may require such payment in advance, grantee being without obligation to remove, raise, or lower its wires and cables until such payment shall have been made. Grantee shall be given not less than 72 hours' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire and cable adjustments. 
7.06  Tree trimming. From time to time, the town council may pass ordinances regulating the trimming or removal of trees on or along town property, and grantee shall comply with these ordinances. 
7.07  Placement of fixtures. Grantee shall not place poles, towers, or similar fixtures where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telecommunications, water hydrant, water main, drainage, sanitary sewer or other facilities located within the town's public rights-of-way as authorized by the town, and all such poles, towers, and similar facilities shall be placed as directed by the town and in such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel or use or visibility of the public rights-of-way. 
7.08  Removal of fixtures. Grantee shall remove its structures, wires, cables, equipment, and facilities of any and all kinds from the public rights-of-way within 30 days following the non-use or cessation of use of such structures, wires, cables, equipment, and facilities. 
7.09  Approval of plans and specifications. With the exception of installation of individual drops and/or emergency repairs, grantee shall provide complete plans and specifications for all construction within public rights-of-way to the town for its review in accordance with applicable town ordinances and permit application procedures. Approval of plans and specifications shall not be unreasonably delayed or denied. In the event of rejection, grantee shall submit revised plans and specifications for approval. This provision shall apply to each construction sequence if the construction is accomplished in phases. 
7.10  Underground installation. In those portions of the town having telephone lines and electric utility lines underground, whether required by ordinance or not, any and all of grantee's lines, cables, and wires shall also be underground. Grantee's lines, cables, wires, and similar facilities located above ground prior to the effective date of this franchise shall be relocated underground by grantee at the same time that other above-ground utility lines (e.g., electric and telecommunications lines) located within the immediate vicinity of grantee's facilities are placed underground. Grantee shall pay the cost of such relocation unless there are funds allocated to affected users of the public right-of-way, including grantee, for the reimbursement of such costs. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the town shall make application for such funds on behalf of the grantee upon request of grantee if grantee cannot make such application itself. It shall be the policy of the town that existing poles for electric and communications purposes be utilized by grantee whenever possible and that underground installation, even when not required, is preferable to the placing of additional poles. 
7.11  Facilities location. From time to time, the town or its representatives, may request identification of the specific location of certain grantee cable system facilities. The grantee agrees to respond to such request within 48 hours of the receipt of the request. In the event that grantee fails to provide the necessary information, and damage is caused to grantee facilities as a direct result of withholding said information, the grantee shall hold the town harmless from all liability, damage, cost or expense resulting from any town action in this regard unless such damage was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the town or its agents. 
The town shall have the right to be informed as to matters in connection with or affecting the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operations, and repair of the cable system facilities of the grantee within the public rights-of-way including, but not necessarily limited to, the identification and location of the grantee's cable system facilities within the public rights-of-way and to updates of such information as changes regarding same occur. At a minimum, this requires grantee to maintain on file with the town a current set of strand and trench drawings of the cable system. Such strand and trench maps shall be updated as changes occur in the cable system, and shall provide, as follows: 
A.  CAD drawings must be submitted in .dxf (drawing exchange file) or other mutually agreeable format.

(iv)  Units feet. 
In addition to providing the location of grantee's facilities, grantee agrees to obtain facilities location information from other users of the public rights-of-way prior to grantee's construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operations and repair of the cable system facilities. 
Upon request by the town, the grantee shall furnish the town information relevant to such matters, which is prepared, maintained, and available in the ordinary course of business.

B.  Expenses. If any action or proceeding is brought against the town or any of its officers, agents, employees, or contractors with respect to which payment may be sought for claims for damages or penalties described in this section, the grantee, upon written notice from the town, shall assume the investigation or defense and fully control any resolution or compromise thereof, including the employment of counsel and the payment of all expenses including the reasonable value of any services rendered by any officers, agents, employees or contractors of the town which are not unreasonably duplicative of services provided by grantee and its representatives. The town shall fully cooperate with the grantee. 
C.  Separate counsel. The town shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof, and the grantee shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if employed with the approval and consent of the grantee or if representation of both the grantee and the town by the same attorney would be inconsistent with accepted canons of professional ethics. 
D.  Indemnification. It is the intent of this section and by its acceptance of this franchise, grantee specifically agrees that grantee, for itself and its agents, employees, subcontractors, and the agents and employees of said subcontractors, shall indemnify and hold the town, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, elected officials, successors and assigns harmless from all liability actions, causes of action, lawsuits, judgments, claims, damages, penalties, costs or fees, including attorney's fees and costs of defense, for any injury to or the death of any person or damage to or destruction of any property arising out of, resulting from or based upon, in whole or in part, any act or omission of grantee, its officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, and agents under this franchise, including without limitation the construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system. In the event that any action, suit or proceeding is brought or claim is made against the town based upon or arising out of any such act or omission of the grantee under this franchise, the town shall give notice in writing of such action, suit, proceeding or claim to the grantee. However, the failure of the town to promptly provide such notice in writing to grantee shall not relieve grantee of its duties and obligations under this section. The town shall not and does not by reason of this granting of this franchise, or any failure to act by the town which may impact the grantee's performance under this franchise, assume any liability of grantee whatsoever for injury to persons, damage to property, or penalties of any kind whatsoever. The provisions of this section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this franchise.

9.07  Issuing companies. Companies issuing the insurance policies shall have no recourse against the town for payment of any premiums or assessments which all are set at the sole risk of the grantee. Insurance policies obtained by grantee shall provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the town in connection with any damage covered by these policies. 
SECTION 10  
10.0 - Cable system characteristics. 
10.01  Channel capacity. As of the effective date of this franchise, the cable system shall have the potential of providing no fewer than 74 channels. At no time during the term of this franchise shall grantee offer fewer than 68 channels to subscribers. All channels being offered to subscribers within the franchise area will adhere to the technical standards set forth in section 12. 
10.02  New construction. Any areas of the town where grantee constructs new cable system facilities shall be built, at a minimum, to the same technical specifications as the cable system existing in the town as of the effective date of this franchise. Specifically, including any new construction areas, the average node size in the town shall be no greater than 800 homes per node, unless the grantee provides the town with valid technical justification for a greater average node size. 
10.03  Cable system capabilities. The cable system will have the following attributes during the term of this franchise: 
A.  Activated return capability from subscriber locations, upon the completion of the upgrade of the cable system to a digital format. 
B.  Emergency standby power rated at a minimum of 12 hours at the headend, four hours at each fiber optic node located throughout the cable system with at least 100 subscribers, and one and one-half hours at any other power supply on the distribution portion of the cable system. 
10.04  Comparability of town cable system to others in metroplex. Grantee's cable system in the town shall be capable of offering cable services that are comparable to other cable systems owned or operated by the grantee or an affiliate of the grantee in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area ("comparable systems") pursuant to the terms of this subsection. If the town believes that there are comparable systems providing more advanced cable services than those offered in the town, the town may send a written request to grantee, not to exceed one notice every three years, requesting information on the cable services offered by the comparable systems. Within 60 days of receiving the request, grantee shall provide the town with information on any cable services that are offered in the comparable systems, but not being offered in the town. If the identified cable services are being offered by grantee or its affiliates to at least 50 percent of the total subscribers in the comparable systems, the town may require that grantee make available such cable services on the cable system in the town. Should the town determine that grantee shall commence provision of such cable services, the town and grantee shall negotiate a schedule for deployment that takes into consideration the impact on subscriber rates, the ability of grantee to recover the cost of such increased capacity or cable services over the remaining life of the franchise from the incremental revenue derived from such additional cable services, and the financial condition of grantee. The parties recognize that, as of the effective date of this franchise, the town is not permitted to require the provision of specific video programming services pursuant to this subsection. 
10.05  Future upgrades. In the event grantee, either voluntarily, or under the terms of subsection 10.04, undertakes an upgrade or rebuild of the cable system during the term of this franchise, at least 30 days prior to the implementation of any upgrade and/or replacement activities, grantee shall provide to the town a written plan which shall include general information as to the construction necessary for the project, and the procedure or method grantee will employ to ensure minimal interruption of cable service. All construction and technical specifications included in the plan(s) submitted by grantee shall be in conformity with the provisions of this franchise, including any lawful and generally applicable town permitting process.

A.  Grantee's cable system within the town shall meet all FCC and other applicable federal technical and signal quality standards for cable systems, including any such standards or regulations as hereinafter may be amended or adopted to the extent that compliance with such amended standards is mandated by federal law or regulation. In the event that such amended standards are not mandated by federal law or regulation, and provide for a less strict performance standard and/or less frequent testing requirements, such modifications will not be included as a part of this franchise unless the town chooses to incorporate by means of a resolution or amendment hereto. 
B.  Antennas, supporting structures, headend and associated equipment, and outside plant used in the cable system shall comply with any applicable federal, state, county, or generally applicable town laws. 
C.  Grantee shall not design, install or operate its facilities in a manner that will interfere with the signals of any broadcast station, the electrical or telephone system located in any building, the cable system of another franchisee, or individual or master antennas used for receiving television or other broadcast signals. 
D.  If the town contacts grantee prior to the next FCC-required test period (i.e., before December 15 and June 15 of each year), a town representative may be present during the testing. Upon request, grantee shall provide summary written reports of the results of such tests to the town.

Upon request of a subscriber, grantee shall provide by sale and/or lease a device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing or use of a particular cable service(s) during periods selected by that subscriber. Subscribers shall be notified individually, in writing, by the grantee of the availability of the device no less frequently than annually. 
12.04  Customer service. The grantee shall provide customer service in accordance with the town's customer service standards set forth in exhibit A. Such standards shall apply to all affiliates that provide cable services to subscribers and any other company that provides cable services under written agreement with the grantee. 
12.05  Quality of service. Throughout the term of this franchise, the grantee shall maintain the quality of service and meet operational standards in the maintenance and operation of its cable system as are required herein. 
Should the town find that the grantee has failed to maintain such quality of service or operational standards, the town may notify the grantee in writing and specifically set forth therein the improvements required to rectify such deficiencies. 
SECTION 13

Grantee shall comply with any FCC or other lawful and applicable federal, state, or local requirements regarding altering or adapting programming for the hearing impaired. Grantee shall not take any action to remove or alter closed captioning provided for the hearing impaired as a part of any programming. Grantee shall deliver intact such closed captioning in the manner in which it arrives at the headend or from another origination source to the cable system. 
13.03  Interconnection. Grantee's subscriber cable system in the town may be interconnected with contiguous cable systems that are owned and operated by grantee or an affiliate, provided that such systems are served by the same headend that serves the town. 
13.04  Use of cable system to provide internet access by multiple providers. The town believes that nondiscriminatory access to the cable system for multiple providers of internet service may be a benefit to subscribers. Therefore, the town reserves the right to adopt requirements for such access to the cable system, subject to applicable law. Prior to such action, the town shall notify the grantee in writing at least 45 days in advance of its intent to impose such a requirement, and hold a hearing, which affords the grantee and other interested members of the public the right to be heard. By approval and acceptance of this franchise, neither the town nor the grantee has waived any rights, obligations, claims, defenses or remedies regarding the town's authority to impose such conditions. 
SECTION 14  
14.0 - Public, educational, and government (PEG) access. 
14.01  Initial channels. As of the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall dedicate three channels for the carriage of PEG programming. The grantee shall ensure that such channels are of a technical quality comparable to any other channel offered over the cable system. 
14.02  Additional channels. Grantee shall make available up to one additional PEG channel (for a total of four PEG channels) under the procedures below. Grantee shall make available up to four additional PEG channels (for a total of eight PEG channels) under the procedures detailed in this section if all the video programming services offered by grantee on the cable system are in a digital format. 
If the town or one of its PEG channel designees believes that additional channel capacity is needed for PEG programming, the interested party may file a request with the town manager. In his/her deliberations, the town manager will consider supply and demand, and, in particular, the ability and resources to produce additional PEG programming, the interest of the community in the additional PEG programming as measured through a survey methodology that is mutually acceptable between the town and the grantee, consideration of the programming that would be displaced, how much programming is produced on the existing PEG channels, how much programming on the existing PEG channels is repeated, how much programming on the existing PEG channels is character-generated, whether it is feasible to cluster PEG programming into blocks of time such that the channel space can be compatibly shared between multiple PEG programming providers, and if several PEG programming providers should combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. 
Should the town manager find that the evidence exists to support the activation of an additional channel for PEG programming, then the town manager shall provide his/her decision in writing and grantee shall provide the channel within 90 days of receiving the request. Grantee may appeal the decision of the town manager to the town council. 
14.03  Underutilized PEG channels. Grantee and the town agree that it is their mutual goal to fully and efficiently use the channel capacity of the cable system, which may include allowing the grantee to use underutilized time on the PEG channels. If grantee believes that any PEG channel has underutilized time, grantee may file a request with the town manager to use that time. In response to the request, the town manager will consider a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, the community's needs and interests, and the source, quantity, type and schedule of the programming carried on the channel. The town manager will also consider, taking into account the mission of the PEG programming, whether it is feasible to cluster PEG programming into blocks of time such that the channel space can be compatibly shared between the PEG programming provider and the grantee and/or if several PEG programming providers can combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. The town manager shall render his/her decision regarding the matter within 60 days of receiving the request. Should the town manager find that the PEG channel or portion of the channel may be used by the grantee, then grantee may begin using such time 90 days after receipt of the decision. The grantee's request shall not be unreasonably denied. Any permission granted pursuant to this subsection for use of a PEG channel or a portion thereof shall be considered temporary. 
At such time as a PEG programming provider believes that it has the resources and ability to utilize any PEG channel currently used by the grantee pursuant to this subsection, the PEG programming provider may request that the town return such PEG channel or portion of a PEG channel being used by the grantee to the PEG programming provider. In response to the request, the town will consider a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, the community's needs and interests, the quantity and schedule of the programming the applicant proposes to carry on the PEG channel, and the applicant's ability and resources to acquire or produce the proposed PEG channel programming. The town will also consider whether it is feasible for the PEG programming provider to cluster programming into blocks of time such that the PEG channel can be compatibly shared between the PEG programming provider and the grantee and/or if several PEG programming providers can combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. The town shall render its decision regarding the matter within 90 days of receiving the request. Should the town find that the evidence exists to support the return of a PEG channel or portion of a PEG channel to the PEG programming provider, then the grantee shall surrender the requested time on the PEG channel within 90 days of receiving the decision. 
14.04  Delivery of PEG programming. PEG programming shall be produced, recorded and transmitted in a format which is compatible with the technology used by the cable system, whether audio, video, or other information (including, by way of example and not limitation, secondary audio, text, digital information, high definition signals and compressed signals). Such uses must be in furtherance of PEG programming uses. 
14.05  Management and control of PEG channels. The town or its designee shall at its discretion manage the use of all PEG channels and facilities and allocate and reallocate the PEG channels amongst public, educational and government access programming. The town may authorize a third party(ies) to control and manage the use of any or all PEG channels and related facilities provided by grantee under this franchise. The town or its designee may formulate rules for the operation of PEG channels consistent with this franchise and federal law. 
14.06  Routing of PEG channel content. Grantee shall continue to provide the necessary upstream channel capacity and equipment to originate PEG channel content from the Town of Flower Mound Town Hall, located at 2121 Cross Timbers Road, Flower Mound, Texas, 75028, for dissemination over the cable system to subscribers, so long as this site is used to originate PEG programming. Grantee shall provide the necessary upstream channel capacity and equipment to route PEG channel content from additional sites as identified by the town within 120 days of said request, provided that the town is responsible for the costs of all construction and equipment. Grantee shall provide the town with an estimate of the construction and equipment costs prior to beginning construction of any new return line. Grantee shall not be responsible for constructing any new return line until the town has approved such costs in writing. 
14.07  Relocation of access channels. Grantee will use reasonable efforts to minimize the movement of PEG channel assignments. Grantee shall provide the town with a minimum of 90 days' notice, and use its best efforts to provide 120 days' notice, prior to the time any PEG channel designation is changed, unless the change is required by federal law, in which case grantee shall give the town the maximum notice possible. In addition, grantee shall pay to the town an amount equal to the town's costs in remarketing the location of the PEG channels and managing the relocation administratively and technologically, up to a maximum of $0.50 per subscriber. Grantee shall only be allowed to recover such amounts paid to the town as "external costs" (as that term is used in 47 C.F.R. section 76.922) if the movement of channels is required by federal, state, or local law. Grantee, at grantee's expense, will place the town's notices of the channel change on or with one regular monthly billing, upon the town's request. Any new channel designations for the PEG channels provided pursuant to this franchise shall be in full compliance with FCC signal quality and proof-of-performance standards. 
14.08  Reception of PEG access signals. All PEG access channels provided for under this section shall be a part of the basic cable service. 
14.09  Technical assistance. Within one hour of a request from the town and/or its designee, identifying a problem and requesting assistance from the grantee regarding a PEG channel, grantee will respond by telephone to address the problem. Within four hours, grantee shall provide technical assistance or diagnostic services to determine whether or not a problem with a PEG channel is the result of matters for which grantee is responsible and, if so, grantee will take prompt corrective action. Such assistance will be at no charge to the town. 
14.10  PEG support. 
A.  Grantee shall provide the town with an initial grant of $5,000.00 at such time as the town requests it during the first year of this franchise for PEG capital, followed by a subsequent contribution of $20,000.00, once the threshold of 5,000 doors passed is reached. The town shall give grantee at least 90 days' advance written notice to submit payment of the grant. Grantee shall be allowed to pass through this payment to subscribers over the term of this franchise. 
B.  Upon at least 90 days' advance written notice the town may require the grantee to provide an additional amount each month not to exceed $0.50 per month, per residential subscriber, as additional capital support for PEG programming. Grantee shall be allowed to pass through these payments to subscribers. 
C.  Grantee shall not be responsible for collecting or paying the PEG capital fee described in subsection 14.10, paragraph B or C on gratis accounts or for subscribers covered by bulk agreements. Each payment shall be due and payable no later than 30 days following the end of the quarter from when the PEG capital fee takes effect. The town may adjust the amount of the PEG capital fee on an annual basis (not to exceed the sum of the amounts specified in subsection 14.10, paragraphs B and C. 
D.  No PEG access channel may be used for the exhibition of any advertisement. For purposes of this section "advertisement" is defined as a message, announcement, or other programming material which is exhibited or otherwise transmitted in exchange for any remuneration and which is intended to (1) promote any service, facility, or product offered by any person who is engaged in such offering for profit; (2) to express the views of any person with respect to any matter of public importance or interest; or (3) to support or oppose any candidate for political office. 
E.  Current PEG equipment. Equipment that is currently provided to the town for PEG channel programming shall become the property of the town at no charge to the town or its subscribers. Equipment which is currently used to provide programming for the public access channel, will also become the property of the town, at no charge to the town or the subscribers. 
F.  Late payment. Grantee shall pay a late charge in an amount which is the greater of $100.00 or 10 percent per annum, compounded daily, on PEG capital fee payments, or portions thereof, that are paid subsequent to the payment dates specified above. 
G.  The town shall have the authority to distribute and re-distribute the PEG capital fee in a manner that is deemed by the town to be in the best interest of the subscribers with respect to PEG programming, in accordance with applicable law. 
SECTION 15  
15.0 - Emergency use of the cable system. 
15.01  Emergency or disaster. In accordance with and at the time required by the provisions of FCC regulations part 11, subpart D, section 11, and as such provisions may from time to time be amended, grantee shall install and maintain an emergency alert system (EAS) for use in transmitting pursuant to such regulations in the event of an emergency. Grantee shall provide the town with the ability to activate the EAS from multiple locations to override both audio and video of all programming services simultaneously during a period of emergency or disaster. Such emergency alert capability shall be operational throughout the term of this franchise. Grantee shall provide the appropriate training to town personnel as may be necessary to operate the equipment and facilities necessary to satisfy this provision of the franchise. 
15.02  Interconnection of EAS. In the event that the town enters into franchise agreements with other cable service providers, to the extent technically and legally feasible, grantee shall cooperate with the town to create a system and/or procedure to simultaneously activate the EAS over all cable systems operating in the town. The cost of such interconnection shall be borne by the other cable operators connecting to the grantee's facilities. 
SECTION 16  
16.0 - Employment requirements. 
16.01  Equal opportunity in employment. Grantee shall afford equal opportunity in employment to all qualified persons. No person shall be discriminated against in employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 
SECTION 17  
17.0 - Other business activity. 
17.01  Limitations and restrictions. Subject to applicable state and federal law, this franchise only authorizes the grantee to provide those services or engage in business activities specifically identified herein. Such limitation is not a prohibition on grantee from providing services or engaging in business activities which the town cannot lawfully restrict or condition. 
SECTION 18  
18.0 - Payment to town. 
18.01  Amount and time. As compensation for the right, privilege, and franchise herein conferred, grantee shall pay to the town each year during the term of this franchise a sum equal to five percent of the grantee's gross revenue. Such payments shall be made quarterly within 45 days after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Accompanying the payment, grantee shall file a financial statement prepared according to generally accepted accounting practice showing in detail the gross revenues used in the computation of said payment. Such statement shall be signed by an officer or certified public accountant of the grantee. 
18.02  Right of inspection of records. The town shall have the right to inspect grantee's records showing the gross revenues from which payments to the town are computed and to audit and recompute any and all amounts paid under this franchise. The town's right to audit and the grantee's obligation to retain records related to a franchise fee audit shall expire three years after each franchise fee payment has been made to the town. Pursuant to subsection 2.01, paragraph Q, subparagraph (i), as part of any franchise fee audit, the town shall specifically have the right to review records related to the allocation of revenue to Cable services in the event grantee offers cable services bundled with non-cable services. 
18.03  Late payment charge. Grantee shall pay a late charge in an amount which is the greater of $100.00 or ten percent per annum, compounded daily, on franchise fee payments, or portions thereof, that are paid subsequent to the payment dates specified in subsection 18.01. The town shall provide written notice to the grantee that such payments have not been received in accordance with the dates specified in subsection 18.01, but such notice does not negate any late charge owed to the town beginning on the day following the required date of receipt under subsection 18.01. In the event the town identifies, as a result of an audit, amounts owed by the grantee from prior periods, the grantee shall pay a late charge of eight percent per annum, compounded quarterly, on the amounts identified, calculated from the date each portion of the underpayment was originally due until the date grantee remits the underpayment to the town. In the event that any audit or recomputation of fees results in an underpayment of greater than five percent (prior to the late charge) for the audit period, grantee shall reimburse the town for its costs to conduct the audit or recomputation. 
18.04  Acceptance. Payments received from the grantee under this section shall not in any way limit or impair any of the privileges or rights of the town, whether under this franchise or otherwise. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is the correct amount, nor shall acceptance be construed as a release of any claim that the town may have for additional amounts payable under the provisions of this section, subject to the limitations in subsection 18.02. 
18.05  Evasion of franchise fees. Any transaction or arrangement made for the purpose of or knowingly results in the evasion of franchise fees payable under this franchise is prohibited. 
18.06  Additional commitments not franchise fees. The franchise fee payable hereunder shall be exclusive of and in addition to all ad valorem taxes, special assessments, fees for municipal improvements, the PEG capital fee, and other lawful obligations of grantee to town. Although the total sum of franchise fee payments and additional commitments set forth elsewhere in this franchise may total more than five percent of grantee's gross revenues in any annual period, grantee agrees that the additional commitments herein are neither franchise fees as defined under any federal law in effect as of the effective date of this franchise, nor are the additional payments to be offset or credited against any franchise fee payments due to the town, nor do they represent an increase in franchise fees to be passed through to subscribers.

19.04  Confidentiality. The town agrees to treat as confidential any books or records that constitute proprietary or confidential information under federal or state law, to the extent grantee makes the town aware of such confidentiality. Grantee shall be responsible for clearly and conspicuously stamping the word "Confidential" on each page that contains confidential or proprietary information, and shall provide a brief written explanation as to why such information is confidential under state or federal law. If the town believes it must release any such confidential books and records in the course of enforcing this franchise, or for any other reason, it shall advise grantee in advance so that grantee may take appropriate steps to protect its interests. If the town receives a demand from any person for disclosure of any information designated by grantee as confidential, the town shall, so far as consistent with applicable law, advise grantee and provide grantee with a copy of any written request by the party demanding access to such information within a reasonable time. Until otherwise ordered by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction, the town agrees that, to the extent permitted by state and federal law, it shall deny access to any of grantee's books and records marked confidential as set forth above to any person. 
SECTION 20  
20.0 - Regulation of rates. 
20.01  Town regulation of grantee's rates. The town council shall regulate, by ordinance, the rates for any and all of those cable services and related installations and equipment of grantee subject to regulation by the town, consistent with FCC rules governing rate regulation and the provisions of the Communications Act. In such event the town council shall first prescribe by ordinance the procedure and standards to be followed and the extent and scope of such rate regulations, all of which matters shall be consistent with due process and shall conform to any and all of those federal and state laws, rules, and regulations then applicable. Subject to its authority to regulate rates the town shall have access to all books and records related to grantee's rates including bulk contract rate information, subject to applicable law.

For purposes of this subsection, "school" means all state-accredited K-12 public and private schools. In addition, grantee shall provide, at no cost, one outlet of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service to new or relocated, owned, or leased and occupied town buildings, schools, and libraries where service is not being provided as of the effective date of this franchise upon request, and if the drop line from the feeder cable to such building does not exceed 150 feet, or if the town, school, or library agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 feet, including the cost of such excess labor and materials. Such obligation to provide free cable service shall not extend to areas of town buildings where the grantee would normally enter into a commercial contract to provide such cable service (e.g., golf courses, airport restaurants and concourses, and recreation center work out facilities). Outlets of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service provided in accordance with this subsection may only be used to distribute cable services throughout such buildings upon the express agreement of the grantee. Any cable service provided under this subsection may only be used for lawful purposes. 
SECTION 22  
22.0 - Prohibition of discriminatory or preferential practices.

23.01  Franchise non-exclusive. The rights, privileges, and franchise granted hereby are not exclusive and nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent town from granting any like or similar rights, privileges, and franchise to any other person within all or any portion of town. The town shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that any person providing video programming services and/or cable services does not enter into the public rights-of-way in the franchise area on terms or conditions materially more favorable or less burdensome to such person than those applied to the grantee pursuant to this franchise. 
23.02  Disputes. In the event that the town grants a franchise to another person to provide video programming and/or cable services in the town, grantee shall have no longer than three months from the date grantee receives a copy of such franchise to notify the town, in writing, of any alleged discrimination between this franchise and the burdens and rights provided in such other franchise. Failure to notify the town shall estop grantee from any further action related to allegations of discrimination regarding the granting of such franchise. This subsection is not intended to prevent grantee from any action related to the town's actual administration of such franchise that the grantee believes is discriminatory. 
SECTION 24  
24.0 - Material breach of franchise, notice and liquidated damages. 
24.01  Notice of default; opportunity to cure; public hearing. 
A.  Notice of default. The town shall notify the grantee, in writing, of an alleged failure to comply with a provision of this franchise, which notice shall specify the alleged failure with reasonable particularity. The grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to: 
(i)  Correct the violation before the town may take further action or with respect to any such violation, if by reason of the nature thereof such violation cannot with due diligence be wholly cured within such period of 30 days, then the 30-day period shall be extended for such period of time as may be necessary to complete the correction of the same with all due diligence, but in no event longer than 90 days unless a further extension of time is approved by the town council; or 
(ii)  Provide a written response to the town, presenting facts and arguments in refutation or excuse of such alleged failure. 
B.  If the town is unsatisfied with the grantee's response under subsection 24.01, paragraph A, the town shall hold a public hearing on the matter. Grantee must be given at least ten days' notice of the hearing. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to all the rights of due process consistent with the town procedures, including, but not limited to, the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. The grantee shall make available to the town, if requested, any records, documents or other information reasonably necessary to its consideration of the matter. Following the public hearing, the town may determine: 
(i)  Whether a failure to comply with a franchise provision has occurred; 
(ii)  Whether such failure is excusable; and 
(iii)  Whether such failure has been cured or will be cured by the grantee. After the hearing, grantee will be provided with a written copy of any action taken by the town council, along with supporting documents. 
C.  If the town determines that a failure to comply with a provision of the franchise has occurred and that such failure is not excusable and has not been or will not be cured by the grantee in a manner and in accordance with a schedule reasonably satisfactory to the town, then the town may take any actions provided in subsection 24.02. 
D.  In the event grantee fails to make a franchise fee payment as require by subsection 18.01, fails to make the PEG payments specified in subsection 14.10, paragraphs A through E, or fails to maintain insurance in accordance with section 9, the town is not required to conduct the public hearing identified in paragraph A above, but may proceed directly to subsection 24.02 for the procedures in paragraph A above. 
24.02  Town action in event of breach. In the event that grounds exist which give the town reason to believe that the grantee failed to comply with a material provision of this franchise, then the town may, at any time during the term of this franchise, to the extent lawful: 
A.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; 
B.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages from the grantee as compensation for such material breach; 
C.  Seek liquidated damages pursuant to subsection 24.03; and/or 
D.  In the case of breach of a material provision of the franchise or other material violation as set forth in subsections 25.01 and 25.02, seek to revoke the franchise pursuant to subsection 25.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town may not pursue monetary damages or liquidated damages for late payment of franchise fees in addition to the interest specified in subsection 18.03, or for late payment of the PEG capital fee in addition to the interest specified in subsection 14.10, paragraph F. 
24.03  Liquidated damages. In the event the town's selected course of action following the process set forth in subsections 24.01 and 24.02 is to impose liquidated damages, the town shall give grantee written notice of its intent, and a reasonable period of time following receipt of the notice, not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days unless a longer period is approved by the town council, to cure the alleged violation. If grantee remains in violation of the franchise following this cure period, the town may charge to and collect from the grantee the liquidated damages set forth below, with the liquidated damages beginning to accrue no earlier than the day following the end of the cure periods. The parties agree that actual damages that might be sustained by the town by reason of the breach by grantee of the provisions of this franchise set forth below are uncertain and difficult of ascertainment, and that the sums set forth below would be reasonable compensation for such breach, and grantee promises to pay, and the town agrees to accept, such sums as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, in the event of such breach. Additionally such sums of money shall be considered liquidated damages due the town by grantee by reason of inconvenience to the public and because of public works supervision and maintenance and other town administrative time and involvement which resulted in the expenditure of public funds due to grantee's failure to comply with certain provisions in this franchise. Grantee covenants that any such sums paid to the town under this provision of the franchise shall not be included in the development of any rate, change, or price for services charged to subscribers. 
A.  For failure of grantee to provide any report, certificate or map to the town as required by this franchise, $50.00 per day. 
B.  For failure of grantee to respond, restore or repair the public rights-of-way within 48 hours of notice by town under subsection 7.03, $250.00 per day for every day following 48 hours after grantee's receipt of the notice. Should the town adopt any lawful and generally applicable ordinance governing the public rights-of-way which includes administrative fees for failure to restore the public rights-of-way, such fees in the ordinance shall apply to the grantee and supersede the ability of the town to collect liquidated damages under this provision of the franchise. 
C.  If town is required to relocate grantee's facilities under subsection 7.04, grantee shall pay $1,000.00 to the town in addition to reimbursement of the costs incurred by the town in relocating the facilities. Should the town adopt any lawful and generally applicable ordinance governing the public rights-of-way which includes administrative fees for town-performed relocation of grantee facilities, such fees in the ordinance shall apply to the grantee and supersede the ability of the town to collect liquidated damages under this provision of the franchise. 
D.  For failure of grantee to provide the PEG channels as required by subsections 14.01, 14.02, or 14.08, $100.00 per day. 
E.  For failure of grantee to provide the return lines required by subsection 14.06, $100.00 per day. 
F.  For failure of grantee to provide the town the ability to activate the EAS as required by subsection 15.01, $500.00 per day. 
G.  For failure of grantee to provide the notice of rates as required by subsection 20.02, $50.00 per day. 
H.  For failure to comply with the service extension requirements set forth in section 28, the greater of $250.00 per day or $1.00 per day per impacted subscriber. 
I.  Force majeure. Other than its failure, refusal, or inability to pay its debts and obligations, including, specifically, the payments to town required by this franchise, grantee shall not be declared in default or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this franchise in those cases in which performance of such provision is prevented by reasons beyond its control. 
24.04  Reservation of rights. The rights reserved to the town under this section are in addition to all other rights of the town whether reserved by this franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any other right the town may have. 
SECTION 25  
25.0 - Revocation of franchise. 
25.01  General. In addition to all rights and powers of the town by virtue of this franchise or otherwise, the town reserves, as an additional and as a separate and distinct power, the right to revoke the franchise in accordance with the procedures specified herein if any of the following events occur or for any of the following reasons: 
A.  Grantee by act or omission substantially violates any material term, condition, or provision of this franchise and shall fail or refuse to effect material compliance following the notice and opportunity to cure specified under subsection 24.01; or 
B.  Grantee knowingly or willingly attempts to evade any material provision of this franchise; or 
C.  Repeated and substantial violation or willful disregard of: 
(i)  Town's lawful ordinances and regulations related to the public rights-of-way; or 
(ii)  The customer service standards in exhibit A; or 
(iii)  The cable system technical performance requirements in subsections 12.01 and 12.02.

E.  Grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt or all or any part of grantee's facilities are sold under an instrument to secure a debt and are not redeemed by grantee within 30 days from the date of such sale; provided, however, this shall not be an event of termination or cancellation in the event of bankruptcy proceeding and the trustee, receiver, or debtor in possession agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this franchise; or 
F.  Grantee has been found by a court of law to have practiced any fraud or deceit in its conduct or relations under this franchise with the town, subscribers or potential subscribers. 
25.02  Material provisions. Material terms of this franchise include, but are not limited to: 
A.  The indemnification required by section 8.

C.  The channel capacity required by subsection 10.01.

The notice shall set forth the causes and reasons for the proposed revocation, shall advise grantee that it will be provided an opportunity to be heard by town regarding such proposed action before any such action is taken, and shall set forth the time, date, and place of the hearing. In no event shall such hearing be held less than 30 days following delivery of such notice to grantee. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to all rights of due process consistent with the town procedures, including but not limited to the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. Any such revocation of this franchise shall be by ordinance. 
25.04  Grantee may appeal town's decision. The grantee may appeal the town's decision to revoke the franchise to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the town's decision de novo and to modify or reverse such decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of the town. 
SECTION 26  
26.0 - Assignment of franchise. 
26.01  Town approval of assignment required. This franchise shall be a privilege personal to the grantee and shall not be assigned or transferred, or otherwise encumbered, without the prior consent of the town. Two exceptions to the requirement of town consent are: 
A.  If such assignment or transfer is to an affiliate of comparable technical and financial capability as well as proven experience in managing and operating cable systems; or 
B.  For a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness. Transfer to an affiliate shall mandate notification from grantee concerning the transfer or assignment. 
C.  For all other requests by grantee to assign or transfer this franchise, grantee shall provide appropriate written notification pursuant to FCC regulations. Within 30 days of receiving the request for transfer, the town shall notify the grantee in writing of the information it requires to determine the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee. If the town has not taken action on the grantee's request for transfer within 120 days after receiving such request, and provided the town has promptly received from grantee the information it requested in connection with the request, consent by the town shall be deemed given. The town may condition its consent to the transfer upon such terms and conditions reasonably related to the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the transferee. No assignment to any person shall be effective until the transferee has filed with the town an instrument in writing, duly executed, reciting the fact of such assignment, accepting the terms of this franchise, and agreeing to comply with all of the provisions hereof, subject to applicable law. 
26.02  Town approval of transfer of control required. The grantee shall promptly notify the town of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or disposition or acquisition by any other person in control of the grantee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the town shall have consented thereto provided that the town has acted within the time constraints required by law. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, disposition, or acquisition of control, the town may inquire into the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the prospective controlling party, but shall do so within 30 days of receipt of the requested transfer from the grantee. Grantee shall assist the town in such inquiry and will respond within ten days unless a longer time is reasonably necessary or allowed by law. 
SECTION 27  
27.0 - Failure of town to enforce franchise. 
27.01  No waiver of terms. The grantee shall not be excused from complying with each and all of the terms, conditions, and provisions of this franchise even though the town should upon one or more occasions fail to insist upon, require, or seek compliance with any such term, condition, or provision. 
SECTION 28  
28.0 - Service availability. 
28.01  Service availability. The grantee shall provide cable service throughout the entire franchise area, subject to the provisions below. 
28.02  Annexations. If the town annexes any contiguous territory which is being provided cable service by the grantee or its affiliates, the annexed area will be subject to the provisions of this franchise upon the effective date of the annexation; provided, however, that grantee shall be allowed a reasonable time under the circumstances to make any required modifications to the cable system, cable services, billing system, etc., as may be required to accommodate such change, and provided that if the area is serviced by an affiliate, a transfer of ownership of the cable system in that area to the grantee shall not be required by the town. If the annexed area is being provided comparable cable service by another provider, grantee shall have the right, but not the requirement, to extend its cable system to the annexed area. In the event that the annexed territory is contiguous and not being provided cable service by any provider, grantee agrees that it shall within 12 months extend its cable system into the newly annexed territory under the terms of subsection 28.03. In the event that the annexed area is not contiguous to the franchise area existing as of the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall not have the obligation to extend to such area. 
28.03  Extension policy. Within six months of a qualified request as described herein, grantee must extend and make cable service available to every lot or tract of land for which the owner or occupant thereof has requested cable service in all unserved areas having at least ten dwelling units constructed or planned for construction per 1,320 cable bearing strand feet or 25 dwelling units per cable bearing strand mile, as measured from the portion of the existing cable system which is to be extended. Extensions shall be at grantee's cost. For purposes of this section, "planned for construction" shall have the meaning of fully prepared lots. 
If more than 150 feet of distance lies between the nearest distribution cable and the point of connection of service to the property for which service is requested, the grantee may charge the potential subscriber non-standard installation charges as permitted by federal law. 
If the unserved area is a new underground development, grantee shall participate in joint trenching with the utilities installing service to the area, provided grantee is provided adequate notice and access to the trenches and is not otherwise prevented from participating due to conditions beyond its control. The ability of the grantee to participate in joint trenching shall not impact the grantee's requirement to provide extensions pursuant to this subsection. 
28.04  Contributions in aid of construction. In the event that potential subscribers request cable service in an area that does not meet the density requirements of subsection 28.03, the subscriber(s) will be given the alternative to provide a contribution in aid of construction of the cable system extension equal to three-fourths of the grantee's actual out-of-pocket costs to provide extension less than 1,320 cable bearing strand feet. That portion of any extension greater than 1,320 cable bearing feet shall be paid by the subscriber(s) at the grantee's actual out-of-pocket cost. In the event that any portion of the extension for which a subscriber has provided contribution in aid of construction ultimately meets the extension requirements in subsection 28.03, grantee shall reimburse all subscribers that have made such contributions in aid of construction, provided that such subscribers provide proof of the contribution in aid of construction to grantee. 
SECTION 29  
29.0 - Valuation. 
29.01  Purchase price of cable system. If the franchise is revoked for cause and the parties agree that the town may purchase the cable system, the town may purchase the cable system at an equitable price. If renewal of the franchise is lawfully denied and the parties agree that the town may purchase the cable system, the town may purchase the cable system at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. Should the parties fail to agree upon the then current fair market value, the same shall be determined in an appropriate proceeding filed in any court having jurisdiction. 
SECTION 30  
30.0 - Recourse, understanding, and construction. 
30.01  Requirements and enforcement. Except as expressly provided herein, grantee shall have no monetary recourse whatsoever against town of any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of the provisions or requirements of this franchise or because of the enforcement thereof by town or because of the lack of town's authority to grant all or any part of this franchise. 
30.02  Grantee's understanding. Grantee expressly acknowledges that in accepting this franchise, it relied solely upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of town to grant this franchise and that grantee was not induced to accept this franchise by any understanding, promise, or other statement, verbal or written, by or on behalf of town or by any third person concerning any term or condition not expressed herein. 
30.03  Construction of franchise. By acceptance of this franchise, grantee acknowledges that it has carefully read the provisions hereof and is willing to and does accept all of the risks of the meanings of such. 
SECTION 31  
31.0 - Acceptance of franchise. 
31.01  Method of acceptance. Within 30 days from the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall file with the town secretary a written statement in the following form signed in its name and behalf: 
"To the Honorable Mayor and Town Council of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas: For itself, its successors, and assigns, Advantex Communications/Grande Communications, duly authorized to do business in the State of Texas, hereby accepts the attached Franchise and agrees to be bound by all of its terms, conditions, and provisions, subject to applicable law. 
Advantex Communications/Grande Communications

31.02  Acceptance of franchise not a waiver. Acceptance of this franchise by grantee shall not constitute a waiver by it of any of its rights. 
SECTION 32  
32.0 - Severability. 
32.01  Provisions severable. If any provision, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this franchise is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this franchise. It is the intent of town in adopting this franchise that no portion or provision thereof shall become inoperative or fail by reason of any invalidity or unconstitutionality of any other portion or provision, and to this end all provisions of this franchise are declared to be severable. 
[SECTION 33.0]  
33.0 - Conflicts.

EXHIBIT A  
1.1.A - Customer service standards. 
1)  Section 1. Definitions. 
A.  Normal operating conditions. Those service conditions which are within the control of the grantee. Those conditions which are not within the control of the grantee include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, labor strikes or slowdowns, telephone network outages, interruption of electric power service which is not a direct result of the grantee's actions, and severe or unusual weather conditions. Those conditions which ordinarily are within the control of the grantee include, but are not limited to, special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate adjustments, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, backup power during power outages, changes in billing cycles, changes in channel line-ups that are within grantee's control, construction, rebuilds, maintenance (including repairs related thereto) and/or upgrade of the cable system. 
B.  Outage. A service interruption affecting multiple subscribers in a contiguous area that has the same source problem. 
C.  Service call. The action taken by the grantee to correct a service interruption affecting an individual subscriber. 
D.  Service interruption. The loss of picture or sound on one or more channels. 
E.  Standard installation. Installations where the length of the drop is up to 125 feet.  
Section 2. - Telephone availability. 
A.  The grantee shall maintain a toll-free number to respond to all calls and inquiries from subscribers in the franchise area and/or town residents regarding cable service. Grantee representatives trained and qualified to answer questions related to cable service in the franchise area must be available to receive requests for service calls or report outages 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and other inquiries at least 45 hours per week, including some evening and weekend hours. Grantee representatives shall identify themselves by name when answering this number. 
B.  The grantee's telephone numbers shall be listed, with appropriate description (e.g. administration, customer service, billing, repair, etc.), in the directory published by the local telephone company or companies serving the franchise area. 
C.  In the event that the grantee chooses to use an automated response unit ("ARU") or a voice response unit ("VRU") to distribute calls, the system shall have as a first tier menu option (not including a routing option for foreign language), an option "for all other inquiries." If a foreign language routing option is provided, and the subscriber does not enter an option, the menu will default to the first tier menu of English options. 
After the first tier menu (not including a foreign language routing option) has run through twice, if customers do not select any option, the ARU or VRU will forward the call to a queue for a live representative. The grantee may reasonably substitute this requirement with another method of handling calls from customers who do not have touch-tone telephones. 
The total elapsed time between when a subscriber's call is first answered by an ARU or VRU to the end of the last tier menu shall not be longer than 90 seconds. For purposes of this subsection, the "last tier menu" is the last tier before the subscriber is routed to a live representative, or specific information is given to the subscriber, such as instructions for troubleshooting or directions to an office. 
The town may review the options provided to callers and recommend to the grantee that additional options be provided. The grantee shall consider the town's recommendations. 
D.  Under normal operating conditions, calls received by the grantee shall be answered within 30 seconds after the subscriber has selected their final menu option. The grantee shall meet this standard for 90 percent of the calls it receives, as measured on a calendar quarter basis. Measurement of this standard shall include all calls received by the grantee, whether they are answered by a live representative, automated attendant, or abandoned before completion. 
If the grantee does not meet the 90 percent standard described in this paragraph D. during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the town against the grantee as follows: 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 [percent] and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $25.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $250.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $75.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $750.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 65 percent and less than 75 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $2,500.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs less than 65 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $500.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $5,000.00. 
For any consecutive quarter(s) in which the grantee performs at a level below 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town the amount listed above for the most recent quarter, plus the amount paid to the town for the previous quarter. For example, if the grantee performs at 79 percent one quarter and 60 percent in the next quarter, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00 for the first quarter and $750.00) [$500.00 for the most recent quarter plus $250.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $2,500.00 for the first quarter and $7,500.00 [$5,000.00 for the most recent quarter plus $2,500.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, callers to the grantee shall receive a busy signal less than three percent of the time during any calendar quarter. 
F.  Not more than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, beginning with the fourth quarter of calendar year 2004, the grantee shall report to the town the following for all call centers receiving calls from subscribers except for temporary telephone numbers set up for national promotions: 
 Total number of calls received by the grantee 
 Number of calls answered by these categories: live representative, automated attendant, and abandoned 
 Number of calls answered within 30 seconds 
 Percentage of calls answered within 30 seconds 
 Percentage of time all trunks were busy 
The material substance of the report shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the town. 
If the town does not receive the quarterly calls report when due, the town shall give notice to the grantee. The grantee shall be assessed liquidated damages in the amount of $5.00 per day for every day following receipt of the notice that the report is not provided to the town, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $50.00 per day. The grantee shall not be assessed liquidated damages for failure to report on statistics which cannot be produced for reasons outside of its control, provided that the grantee supplies an explanation to the town as to why the statistics required herein could not be produced. 
G.  The grantee shall notify the town's designee as promptly as possible, by any available means, whenever there is a situation that prevents all subscribers from being able to reach the grantee by telephone. 
H.  At the grantee's option, the measurements and reporting above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The grantee shall notify the town of such a change at least 30 days in advance of any implementation.  
Section 3. - Service centers. 
A.  The grantee shall provide the town with a written list of service centers and hours of operation for each location that subscribers can visit for any of the following functions, and notify the town of any subsequent changes in either location or hours 30 days in advance. Such locations shall be open at least 40 hours during the week, including some evening and weekend hours. 
 To accept payments 
 To exchange or accept return of grantee-provided equipment 
 To schedule technical calls and delivery and pick up of converter boxes, remotes and similar grantee-supplied equipment from subscribers 
 To answer subscriber inquiries  
Section 4. - Installations and service appointments. 
A.  All installations will be in accordance with FCC rules, including but not limited to, appropriate grounding, connection of equipment to ensure reception of cable service, and the provision of required consumer information and literature to adequately inform the subscriber about the utilization of the grantee-supplied equipment and cable services. 
B.  Under normal operating conditions, standard installations shall be performed within seven days after an order has been placed, except for those subscribers who specifically request an installation date later than seven days after order placement. 
The company shall meet this standard for 90 percent of the standard installations it performs, as measured on a calendar quarter basis, excepting out customer requests for connection later than seven days after order placement. 
If the grantee does not meet the 90 percent standard described in this paragraph B. during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the town against the grantee as follows: 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 [percent] and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $25.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $250.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $75.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $750.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 65 percent and less than 75 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $2,500.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs less than 65 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $500.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $5,000.00. 
For any consecutive quarter(s) in which the grantee performs at a level below 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town the amount listed above for the most recent quarter, plus the amount paid to the town for the previous quarter. For example, if the grantee performs at 79 percent one quarter and 60 percent in the next quarter, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00 for the first quarter and $750.00 [$500.00 for the most recent quarter plus $250.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $2,500.00 for the first quarter and $7,500.00 [$5,000.00 for the most recent quarter plus $2,500.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter. 
In addition, any individual subscriber who does not have their standard installation completed within the seven-day period shall be entitled to receive a free standard installation upon request, except for those subscribers who request installation later than seven days after order placement. 
C.  The grantee shall provide the town with a report, beginning with the fourth quarter of calendar year 2004, within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, noting the following: 
* Number of total standard installations completed for the quarter, excluding those requested outside of the seven-day period by the subscriber 
* Number of standard installations completed within the seven-day period 
* Number of standard installations not completed within the seven-day period 
* Percentage of standard installations completed within the seven-day period, excluding those requested outside of the seven-day period by the subscriber 
At the grantee's option, the measurements and reporting above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The grantee shall notify the town of such a change not less than 30 days in advance. 
D.  The grantee will offer subscribers "appointment window" alternatives for installations, service calls, and other installation activities of a maximum four-hour scheduled time block between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. except during months where available light does not permit appointments after 6:00 p.m. At the grantee's discretion, the grantee may offer subscribers appointments other than these four-hour time blocks if agreeable to the subscriber. The grantee may offer to schedule subscriber appointments for a specific time and shall schedule the subscriber to be the first call of the day or last call of the day if requested by the subscriber and warranted by the circumstances. The grantee shall also perform some service calls outside of the hours specified above in the evenings and on weekends. 
E.  At the request of the subscriber, the grantee will call the subscriber prior to an installation or service call appointment. The call shall be made by the grantee at the approximate time and to the telephone number requested by the subscriber. 
F.  At the time this franchise was entered into, grantee was voluntarily participating in the industry "on-time guarantee" program. Under the terms of that program, if the grantee does not arrive for an installation or service call appointment within the scheduled time frame agreed to with the subscriber, the subscriber is entitled to receive either a free standard installation in the event of an installation appointment, or a $20.00 credit in the event of a missed service call appointment. Calling a subscriber during the appointment window does not negate the subscriber's entitlement to credit for a missed appointment. The grantee will participate in this program and reserves the right to substitute another customer service program for the "on-time guarantee" at its discretion, provided that the subscriber benefits are reasonably comparable to those provided by the current program. 
G.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber after 6:00 p.m. On the business day prior to the day of the scheduled appointment. 
H.  If the grantee's representative is running late for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the grantee will document an effort to contact the subscriber directly. If, however, the subscriber is unavailable at the time the contact attempt is made, the grantee will attempt at least a second documented contact during the previously agreed upon appointment window or before the specifically scheduled time. The appointment will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is mutually agreeable. 
I.  If it is necessary to place a temporary drop on the ground, the grantee shall bury the temporary drop within ten business days, under normal operating conditions. The ten-day period shall be extended for days that the grantee is unable to bury the drop due to unfavorable weather conditions or is unable to gain access to a temporary drop located on private property. If grantee fails to bury the drop within this authorized time period, grantee shall pay the town $100.00 a day for each day that a drop remains on the ground.  
Section 5. - Service interruptions and outages. 
A.  The grantee shall make repairs promptly, and interrupt cable service only as necessary and for the shortest time period possible. Unless otherwise required by law or approved by the town, the grantee will not schedule routine testing or maintenance which would cause a service interruption or outage on Friday, Saturday or Sunday night. 
B.  The grantee shall promptly notify the town of any significant outage of the cable system. For the purposes of this section, a significant outage of the cable system shall mean any service interruption lasting at least four continuous hours that affects at least ten percent of the subscribers in the franchise area. 
C.  The grantee shall exercise its best efforts to limit any outage for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, or constructing the cable system. Except in an emergency or other situation necessitating a more expedited or alternative notification procedure, the grantee may schedule an outage for a period of more than four hours during any 24-hour period only after the town and each affected subscriber in the town have been given 15 days' prior notice of the proposed outage. 
D.  Technicians employed by the grantee who are capable of responding to outages must be available to respond 24 hours a day, seven days per week. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee must respond to a call or written notice from a subscriber regarding a service interruption within 24 hours. The grantee must begin actions to correct all other cable service problems the next business day after notification by the subscriber or the town of a cable service problem. 
F.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall complete service calls within 72 hours after being notified of a service interruption, not including situations where the subscriber is not reasonably available for a service call to correct the service interruption within the 72-hour period. 
G.  The grantee shall meet the standard in paragraph F. of this section for 90 percent of the service calls it completes, as measured on a quarterly basis. 
If the grantee fails to meet this standard during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the town against the grantee as follows: 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 [percent] and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $25.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $250.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $75.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $750.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 65 percent and less than 75 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $2,500.00. 
* Any quarter where the grantee performs less than 65 percent, the grantee shall pay the town $500.00, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $5,000.00. 
For any consecutive quarter(s) in which the grantee performs at a level below 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the town the amount listed above for the most recent quarter, plus the amount paid to the town for the previous quarter. For example, if the grantee performs at 79 percent one quarter and 60 percent in the next quarter, the grantee shall pay the town $250.00 for the first quarter and $750.00 [$500.00 for the most recent quarter plus $250.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $2,500.00 for the first quarter and $7,500.00 [$5,000.00 for the most recent quarter plus $2,500.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter. 
H.  The grantee shall provide the town with a report, beginning with the fourth quarter of calendar year 2004, within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, noting the following: 
 Number of total service calls completed for the quarter, not including service calls where the subscriber was reasonably unavailable for a service call within the 72-hour period. 
 Number of service calls completed within the 72-hour period. 
 Percentage of service calls completed within the 72-hour period, not including service calls where the subscriber was reasonably unavailable for a service call within the 72-hour period. 
 At the grantee's option, the measurements and reporting above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The grantee shall notify the town of such a change at least 30 days in advance. 
I.  Within 30 days following the end of each calendar year, grantee shall provide a report of all service calls for the year by category. 
J.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall provide credit upon subscriber request to affected subscriber(s) when there is an outage or service interruption of all channels for a period of four consecutive hours or more. The credit for such an outage shall equal, at a minimum, a proportionate amount of the affected subscriber(s) current monthly bill. In order to qualify for the credit, the subscriber must promptly report the problem and allow the grantee to verify the outage if requested by the grantee. 
K.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall provide a credit upon subscriber request to any subscriber experiencing an outage or service interruption of any specific cable service or channel for a period of four consecutive hours or more. The credit shall equal, at a minimum, a proportionate amount of the affected cable services. In order to qualify for the credit, the subscriber must promptly report the problem and allow the grantee to verify the outage if requested by the grantee. 
L.  Under normal operating conditions, if an outage affects all video programming cable services in an area which serves more than ten percent of total grantee subscribers in the franchise area, for more than 24 consecutive hours, the grantee shall issue an automatic credit to the affected subscribers in the amount of the value of basic plus expanded basic service for the proportionate time the cable service was out. Such credit will be reflected on subscriber billing statements within 45 days following the outage. Such credit under this provision does not negate the subscriber's right to request additional credit under items J. and K. herein.  
Section 6. - Customer complaints. 
A.  The grantee shall maintain a written log or an equivalent stored in computer memory and capable of access and reproduction in printed form, of all cable-related subscriber contacts which result in a service call. Such log shall, at a minimum, list the date and time of such contact, the nature of the complaint, and when and what actions were taken by the grantee in response thereto. Such log shall be kept at the grantee's office in or near the franchise area, for a period of at least three years and shall be available for inspection during regular business hours by town upon request, subject to section 631 of the Cable Act regarding subscriber privacy. 
Additionally, the grantee shall maintain a written or electronic log of every subscriber complaint referred by the town, including the dates, times and detailed information related to the complaint and resolution. The grantee shall cooperate with the town in the development of this log format. 
If the town receives a pattern of complaints from subscribers which indicates a recurring problem, town may require the grantee to maintain a manual or electronic log of the problem being tracked until such time as the calls to the town are reasonably reduced. 
B.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall resolve subscriber complaints referred by the town within 72 hours. The grantee shall notify the town of those matters that necessitate an excess of 72 hours to resolve, but those matters must be finally resolved within ten days of the initial complaint. The town may require reasonable documentation to be provided by the grantee to substantiate the request for additional time to resolve the problem. If the grantee fails to resolve a complaint within the required 72 hours (or extended period), the grantee shall pay to the town $10.00 per day for each day the complaint is not resolved within the specified time frame, until such time as grantee reaches the threshold of 5,000 doors passed, at which point the liquidated damages amount will be increased to $100.00 per day. 
For purposes of this subsection, "resolve" means that the grantee shall perform those actions which, in the normal course of business, are necessary to respond to the subscriber's problem. 
C.  The grantee's customer service representatives shall have the authority to provide credit for interrupted cable service or any of the other credits, to waive fees, and to schedule service appointments. Any difficulties that cannot be resolved by the customer service representative shall be referred to the appropriate supervisor who shall contact the customer within four hours and resolve in accordance with this section.  
Section 7. - Billing. 
A.  Subscriber bills must be itemized, in accordance with cable services purchased by subscribers and related equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, credits, and late charges. If the grantee chooses to itemize franchise fees and/or other governmentally imposed fees as a separate line item(s), such fees must be shown in accordance with applicable law. The grantee shall maintain records of the date and place of mailing of bills and upon request shall certify in writing to town the date of mailing of each group of bills. 
B.  Every subscriber with a current account balance sending payment directly to grantee shall be given at least 20 days from the date statements are mailed to the subscriber until the payment due date. Automatic withdrawals for payment shall be performed in accordance with Uniform Commercial Code. 
C.  Within one year of the effective date of the franchise, to the extent that the grantee chooses to bill in advance for cable services, every subscriber with a current account balance sending payment directly to the grantee shall be given at least 15 days from the first day of the billing period until the payment due date. The billing period is the time period for which cable services are being billed. For example, if the customer's billing period is from the first to the thirty-first of the month, the due date shall not be earlier than the fifteenth day of the month. 
D.  A specific due date shall be listed on the bill of every subscriber whose account is current. Delinquent accounts may receive a bill that lists the due date as "upon receipt"; however, the current portion of that bill shall not be considered past due except in accordance with B. and C. above. 
E.  Any subscriber who, in good faith, disputes all or part of any bill shall have the option of withholding the disputed amount without disconnect or late fees being assessed until the dispute is resolved, provided that: 
* The subscriber pays all undisputed charges; 
* The subscriber provides notification of the dispute to grantee within five days of the due date; and 
* The subscriber cooperates in determining the accuracy and/or appropriateness of the charges in dispute. 
It shall be within the grantee's sole discretion to determine when the dispute has been resolved; however, the town has the right to determine if the grantee has met its obligations to the subscriber under this subsection. 
F.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall investigate and resolve all billing complaints received from subscribers within five business days of receipt of the complaint if the dispute is regarding charges that are no greater than six months old, or within 15 business days if the dispute involves charges that are more than six months old. 
G.  Subscriber bills from the grantee shall include the name, address and telephone number of the appropriate regulatory agencies, including the town. The town shall have the opportunity to approve the name, address and telephone number of the town that appears on the bills. 
H.  The grantee shall provide a telephone number and address on the bill for subscribers to contact the grantee. 
I.  The grantee shall forward a copy of any billing inserts or other mailing sent to subscribers to the town upon request. 
J.  The grantee shall provide all subscribers with the option of paying for cable service by (1) cash, (2) check, (3) an automatic payment plan, where the amount of the bill is automatically deducted from a checking account designated by the subscriber, or (4) by using a major credit card, as determined by the grantee, on a preauthorized basis. 
The town recognizes that only option (4) above is available as of the effective date of this franchise for subscription to the grantee's cable internet service, but that the grantee is taking steps to make options (1)(3) available in the near future. The town reserves the right to enforce the requirement above for the cable internet service if the grantee has not voluntarily made available the other payment options within 18 months of the effective date of this franchise.  
Section 8. - Deposits, refunds and credits. 
A.  The grantee may require refundable deposits from subscribers with (1) a poor credit or poor payment history, (2) who refuse to provide credit history information to the grantee, or (3) who rent subscriber equipment from the grantee, so long as such deposits are applied on a non-discriminatory basis. The maximum deposit the grantee may charge subscribers with poor credit or poor payment history or who refuse to provide credit information is the average of a typical subscriber's bill over the most recent six-month period. The maximum deposit the grantee may charge for subscriber equipment is the cost (not depreciated value) of the equipment that the grantee would need to purchase to replace the equipment rented to the subscriber. 
B.  The grantee shall pay simple annual interest at five percent on deposits collected for equipment that are unrelated to poor credit or poor payment history if the deposit is held by the grantee for a period in excess of one year, and the subscriber's account is current at the time the deposit is refunded. The grantee shall pay interest on other deposits if required by state law or other generally applicable law. 
C.  Under normal operating conditions, refund checks will be issued within 45 days following the resolution of the event giving rise to the refund. 
D.  Credits for cable service will be issued no later than the subscriber's next bill which is printed following the determination that a credit is warranted, and the credit is approved and processed. Such approval and processing shall not be unreasonably delayed. 
E.  Bills shall be considered paid when appropriate payment is received by the grantee or its authorized agent. Appropriate time considerations shall be included in the grantee's collection procedures to assure that payments due have been received before late notices or termination notices are sent.  
Section 9. - Rates, fees and charges. 
A.  The grantee shall not, except to the extent expressly permitted by law, impose any fee or charge for service calls to a subscriber's premises to perform any repair or maintenance work related to grantee equipment necessary to receive cable service, except where any such problem which was caused by a negligent or wrongful act of the subscriber (including, but not limited to, a situation in which the subscriber reconnects grantee equipment incorrectly), or by the failure of the subscriber to take reasonable precautions to protect the grantee's equipment (for example, a dog chew). 
B.  Any late fee that grantee assesses on subscribers in the town for delinquent payment shall not exceed the prevailing late fee assessed by grantee or its affiliates on cable service within the entire Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, metropolitan area. The grantee shall provide written advance notice to subscribers of the possible assessment of a late fee, including the amount of the late fee, on bills or by separate notice, and upon request by the town the grantee will provide to the town written explanation of any change to the late fee. 
C.  No late fee may be assessed on cable services until one month following the date of the bill on which the charges first appeared. The amount of the late fee shall be subject to any applicable federal, state or local consumer protection laws or other lawful and applicable regulations.  
Section 10. - Disconnection /denial of service. 
A.  The grantee shall not terminate cable service for nonpayment of a delinquent account unless the grantee provides a notice of the delinquency and impending termination at least 15 days prior to the proposed termination. The notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the subscriber to whom the cable service is billed. This notice shall not be given until five days after the original due date for the charges. The notice of delinquency and impending termination may be part of a billing statement. 
B.  In the event that cable service is terminated pursuant to a bulk contract and the grantee is permitted to enter into cable service arrangements with individual dwellings previously serviced under such contract, the grantee shall not hold such individual subscriber(s) liable for any nonpayment or underpayments related specifically to the contract. Subscribers may be held accountable for payment for cable services subscribed to during the period of the contract, which were in addition to the cable services provided pursuant to the contract. 
C.  Cable service terminated in error must be restored without charge within 24 hours of notice. If subscriber was billed for the period during which cable service was terminated in error, an automatic credit shall be issued to subscriber if the service interruption was reported by the subscriber. The amount of the automatic credit shall be in accordance with section 5, paragraph J. of these customer service standards. 
D.  Subject to section 23 of this franchise, the grantee shall furnish and maintain cable services to each person who makes a request to receive any grantee-offered cable service. Nothing in these standards shall limit the right of the grantee to deny cable service for non-payment of previously provided cable services, refusal to pay any required deposit, theft of cable service, damage to the grantee's equipment, or abusive and/or threatening behavior toward the grantee's employees or representatives. 
E.  No period of notice prior to requested termination of service can be required of subscribers by the grantee. No charge shall be imposed upon the subscriber for or related to total disconnection of cable service, or for any cable service delivered after the effective date of the disconnect request (unless there is a delay in returning grantee equipment). If the subscriber fails to specify an effective date for disconnection, the subscriber shall not be responsible for cable service received after the day following the date the disconnect request is received by the grantee. For purposes of this subsection, the term "disconnect" shall include subscribers who elect to cease receiving cable service from the grantee and to receive cable service or other multi-channel video service from another person or entity. 
F.  Upon the termination of cable service and upon request by the subscriber, the grantee shall either entirely remove its drop or secure the drop in a method reasonably acceptable to town.  
Section 11. - Communications with subscribers. 
A.  All grantee personnel, contractors and subcontractors contacting subscribers or potential subscribers outside of the office of the grantee shall wear a clearly visible identification card bearing their name and photograph. The grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. In addition, all grantee representatives shall wear appropriate clothing while working at a customer's premises. Every service vehicle of the grantee, its contractors or subcontractors shall be clearly identified as such to the public. Specifically, grantee vehicles shall have the grantee's logo and phone number plainly visible; those of contractors and subcontractors working for the grantee shall have the contractor's/subcontractor's name and phone number plus markings (such as a magnetic door sign) indicating they are under contract to the grantee. 
B.  All contact with a subscriber or potential subscriber by a person representing the grantee shall be conducted in a courteous manner. 
C.  The grantee shall send annual written notices to all subscribers informing them that any complaints or inquiries not satisfactorily handled by the grantee may be referred to the town. Such notification shall be either: 
* A separate document included with a billing statement; 
* Included on the portion of the monthly bill that is to be retained by the subscriber; or 
* A separate mailing. 
D.  The grantee shall notify subscribers in writing and as soon as possible of any pricing changes or additional charges (excluding temporary marketing on sales discounts or offers) and/or any changes in cable services, including channel line-ups. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of 30 days in advance of such changes if within the control of the grantee, and the grantee shall provide a copy of the notice to the town including how and when the notice was given to subscribers.

A copy of notices required in this paragraph E. will be given to the town at least 15 days prior to distribution to subscribers if the reason for notice is due to a change that is within the control of grantee and as soon as possible if not within the control of grantee. 
F.  Notices of changes in rates shall indicate the new rate and the amount the rate has increased or decreased from the current rate. Specific words such as "increase" or "decrease" must be used to describe the changes.

ARTICLE II. - TELEPHONE  
DIVISION 1. - SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY[5] 
An ordinance whereby the Town of Flower Mound, Texas, and Southwestern Bell Telephone Company agree that, for the purpose of operating its telecommunications business, the telephone company shall maintain and construct its poles, wires, anchors, fiber, cables, manholes, conduits and other physical plant and appurtenances in, along, across, on, over, through, above and under all public streets, avenues, highways, alleys, sidewalks, bridges or public property in said town; prescribing the annual compensation due the town under this ordinance; prescribing the conditions governing the use of public rights-of-way and the performance of certain construction work on public rights-of-way for the telephone company's telecommunications business; providing an indemnity clause; specifying governing laws; providing for a release of all claims under prior ordinances; providing for future contingencies; providing for written acceptance of this ordinance by the telephone company; and providing for a term and an effective date. 
Whereas, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (hereinafter referred to as the "telephone company") is now and has been engaged in the telecommunications business in the State of Texas and in furtherance thereof, has erected and maintained certain items of its physical plant in the town of Flower Mound, Texas (hereinafter referred to as the "town") for many years pursuant to such rights as have been granted it by and under the laws of the State of Texas, and subject to the reasonable exercise of the powers granted by and under said laws to the town and as reflected in prior ordinances of the town; and 
Whereas, the telephone company has operated its telecommunications business in the town under successive ordinances of the town, the last of which was Ordinance No. 20-89, adopted May 15, 1989, which provided compensation of the town for that agreement based upon a percentage of gross receipts received by the telephone company from certain services rendered within the corporate limits of the town; and 
Whereas, certain disputes have arisen regarding those prior ordinances and it is recognized by the parties that changes in the telecommunications industry, changes in technology, changes in state and federal law, and changes in the accounting practices mandated by the Uniform System of Accounts promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), along with regulatory requirements of the Texas Public Utility Commission ("PUC"), have caused the traditional method of determining the amount of compensation to municipalities to become administratively impractical for telecommunications utilities. In order to resolve these issues in a manner satisfactory to both the town and the telephone company, the town and the telephone company have chosen the method of determining the amount of compensation provided for in this ordinance to eliminate the expense and time related to audits, to achieve administrative simplicity, to provide the town with predictable revenues and an opportunity for growth and to avoid the expense and delays of further litigation which otherwise would be necessary to resolve the issues in controversy between the parties; and 
Whereas, it is to the mutual advantage of both the town and the telephone company that an agreement should be entered into between the telephone company and the town establishing the conditions under which the telephone company shall maintain and construct its physical plant in the town in the future; 
Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Town Council of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas, that:

Section 10. - Indemnity. 
The telephone company shall indemnify and hold the town harmless from all costs, expenses (including attorney's fees) and damages to persons or property arising directly or indirectly out of the construction, maintenance or operation of the telephone company's facilities located within the public rights-of-way found to be caused solely by the negligence of the telephone company. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the telephone company and the town; nor is this provision intended to abrogate the common law or statutory rights of either the town or the telephone company to indemnity or contribution from the other.  
Section 11. - Administration of ordinance. 
(a)  The town may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to this ordinance and the telephone company shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis by providing information which is prepared, maintained and available in the ordinary course of business.

(c)  The town may establish, after reasonable notice, such rules and regulations as may be appropriate for the administration of this ordinance and the construction of the telephone company's facilities on town property to the extent permitted by law.  
Section 12. - Compensation to the town. 
(a)  As compensation for the use, occupancy, oversight, supervision and regulation of the town's rights-of-way and for any other consideration provided by the town under this agreement, and in lieu of and in full compensation for any lawful tax or license or charge or right-of-way permit fee or inspection fee, whether charged to the telephone company or its contractor(s), or any right-of-way easement or street or alley rental or franchise tax or other character of charge for use and occupancy of the rights-of-way within the town, except the usual general ad valorem taxes, special assessments in accordance with state law or sales taxes now or hereafter levied by the town in accordance with state law, the town hereby imposes a charge upon the gross receipts (as hereinafter defined) of the telephone company. The amount of the charge for the first year this ordinance is in effect shall be $23,500.00. For the second year, the charge shall be increased by the growth factor as set forth in paragraph 12(c), if applicable. For the third and subsequent years, while this ordinance remains in effect, the above charge is subject to adjustment by application of the growth factor set out in paragraph 12(c). In no event shall such charge be less than the above amount for each year this ordinance is in effect, except as provided in the case of disannexation as set forth in paragraph 12(e), or as provided in section 16 herein. 
The telephone company will, according to tariff, bill such charge to the customers billed the customer service charges included within the term "gross receipts," as defined herein. Gross receipts, for purposes of this charge, shall include only customer service charges which meet all four of the following conditions: (1) such charges are for telephone company services provided within the town; (2) such charges are billed through the telephone company's customer records information system ("CRIS"); (3) such charges are the recurring charges for the local exchange access rate element specified in the telephone company's tariffs filed with the PUC; and (4) such charges are subject to an interstate end user common line ("EUCL") charge as imposed by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"). 
For the second and subsequent years while this ordinance remains in effect, the above charge is subject to adjustment by application of the growth factor set out in paragraph 12(c). This adjustment for the growth factor will be made effective as of each anniversary date of this ordinance. 
The telephone company shall adjust its billings to customers to account for any undercollection or overcollection of the charge due the town. 
(b)  The charge for each year shall be paid in four equal payments. The first payment under this ordinance shall be due on the last day of the fifth month following the effective date hereof, with subsequent payments due on the last day of each third successive month thereafter during the term of this ordinance. In the event of any over or undercollection from customers at the expiration of this ordinance, the telephone company may make a pro rata one-time credit or charge to the customer billing for affected customers who are billed for a service included within gross receipts, as defined in paragraph 12(a). This will be accomplished within 150 days following the date of expiration of this ordinance. If however, it is impractical to credit any overcollection to customers, then such overcollection shall be paid to the town. 
(c)  The growth factor shall be calculated by dividing the telephone company's revenues within the corporate limits of the town subject to state sales taxes ("sales tax revenues") for the 12-month period ending three months prior to the next anniversary date of this ordinance by the sales tax revenues for the 12-month period ending three months prior to either the initial effective date or the preceding anniversary date of this ordinance, as applicable. The growth factor calculated by the method set forth in the preceding sentence, if greater than one, shall be multiplied by the current year's charge to determine the dollar amount of the charge for the next year. If the growth factor calculated above is one or less, the charge for the next year shall be equal to the current year's charge. The telephone company will adjust its customer billing to account for the growth factor calculated above. 
Once the growth factor calculation is completed, the telephone company will provide the town with the sales tax revenues upon which the growth factor calculation was based. 
The town agrees to rely upon audits by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts of state sales taxes as reported by the telephone company which are performed in compliance with V.T.C.A, Tax Code §§ 151.023 and 151.027. The growth factor shall be recomputed to reflect any final, nonappealable adjustments made pursuant to an audit finding by the Texas Comptroller of an inaccuracy in the telephone company's reports of revenues subject to state sales taxes. The charge shall be recalculated using the growth factor recomputed as specified in the preceding sentence, and the recalculated charge shall be used for all future calculations required by this ordinance. Any overpayment or underpayment resulting from such recalculation shall be subtracted from or added to the first installment due the following year. If any overpayment or underpayment shall be due during the final year of this ordinance, then payment shall be made as follows. In the case of overpayment by the telephone company, the town shall pay such overpayment to the telephone company within 150 days following the expiration of this ordinance and, in the case of underpayment by the telephone company, the telephone company shall pay such underpayment to the town within 150 days following the expiration of this ordinance. 
(d)  Such payments shall not relieve the telephone company from paying all applicable municipally owned utility service charges. Should the town not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing charge shall be in lieu of the taxes, licenses, charges, rights-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes aforesaid, then the town agrees that it will apply so much of such payments as may be necessary to the satisfaction of the telephone company's obligation, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, rights-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes. 
(e)  In the event that either (1) territory within the boundaries of the town shall be disannexed and a new incorporated municipality created which includes such territory or (2) an entire, existing incorporated municipality shall be consolidated or annexed into the town, then notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, the charge shall be adjusted. To accomplish this adjustment, within 30 days following the action effecting a disannexation/annexation as described above, the town shall provide the telephone company with maps of the affected area(s) showing the new boundaries of the town. 
In the event of an annexation as described above, the charge for the town will be adjusted to include the amount of the payment by the telephone company to the existing incorporated municipality being annexed. In the event that the annexed municipality had no ordinance imposing a charge or in the event of a disannexation, then the adjustment to the charge will be calculated using the effective date of the imposition of local sales taxes as determined by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The adjustment shall be the percent increase/decrease in the telephone company's gross receipts as defined herein for the town for the first calendar month following the local sales tax effective date compared to the last month prior to such effective date. This adjustment to the charge will be made on the first day of the second month following the local sales tax effective date and the adjusted charge shall be prorated from that date through the remainder of the payment year. The charge as adjusted shall be used for all future calculations required by this ordinance.  
Section 13. - Assignment of ordinance. 
This ordinance and any rights or privileges hereunder shall not be assignable to any other entity without the express consent of the town. Such consent shall be evidenced by an ordinance which shall fully recite the terms and conditions, if any, upon which such consent is given.  
Section 14. - Mutual releases. 
Upon final approval, as defined in the stipulation of settlement, the town hereby fully releases, discharges, settles and compromises any and all claims which the town has made or could have made arising out of or connected with Ordinance Number 20-89, adopted May 15, 1989, and renewed or extended from time to time thereafter, and its predecessor ordinances, if any (hereinafter referred to collectively as "ordinances"). This full and complete release of claims for any matters under the ordinances shall be for the benefit of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company; its parent; its affiliates; their directors, officers, attorneys and employees; successors and assigns; and includes any and all claims, actions, causes of action and controversies, presently known or unknown, arising directly or indirectly out of or connected with the telephone company's obligations to the town pursuant to the provisions of the ordinances.

It is the intent of the town and the telephone company to enter into the foregoing mutual releases in order to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both the town and the telephone company. This ordinance and the mutual releases set forth in this section represent a compromise of each party's claims as well as each party's defenses, and is not intended to be and is not an admission of liability or vulnerability by either party to the other with respect to either the claims or the defenses asserted against the other.  
Section 15. - Adoption of stipulation of settlement. 
The town hereby adopts, ratifies, confirms, and agrees to be bound by the terms of the stipulation of settlement in Cause No. D-142,176 in the 136th Judicial District Court in and for Jefferson County, Texas (the "class litigation"), in its entirety, in all respects as if the town were an original signatory thereto. The town acknowledges that as a member of the settlement class in the class litigation it has received and reviewed the stipulation of settlement and that the town has had access to and/or has consulted counsel, to the extent that it desired to do so, in connection with its evaluation of the stipulation of settlement.  
Section 16. - Repeal of conflicting ordinances and agreements. 
Ordinance Number 20-89, adopted May 15, 1989, and all predecessor ordinances are hereby repealed; provided, however, such repeal shall take effect at 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the effective date specified in the section of this ordinance entitled "Acceptance of Agreement and Effective Date."

All other ordinances and agreements and parts of ordinances and agreements in conflict herewith are also repealed, to the extent of such conflict only, which repeal shall take effect at the time and on the date specified in the preceding sentence.

(b)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, the town and telephone company agree that in the event this ordinance is submitted for review to any court in which the currently existing case styled City of Port Arthur et al, v.

Be it ordained by the Town Council of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas: 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note Printed herein is the gas franchise with Atmos Energy Corporation, as adopted by Ordinance No. 59-12 on November 5, 2012, inasmuch superseding former Ordinance No. 57-10 , §§ 110, adopted September 20, 2010. Amendments to the franchise are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. For stylistic purposes, headings have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. 
 
Sec. 1. - Grant of authority. 
The Town of Flower Mound, Texas, hereinafter called "town," hereby grants to Atmos Energy Corporation, Mid-Tex Division, hereinafter called "Atmos Energy," its successors and assigns, consent to use and occupy the present and future streets, alleys, highways, public utility easements, public ways and other public places ("public rights-of-way"), for the purpose of laying, maintaining, constructing, protecting, operating, and replacing therein and thereon pipelines and all other appurtenant equipment (the "system") to deliver, transport, and distribute gas in, out of, and through town for persons, firms, and corporations, including all the general public, and to sell gas to persons, firms, and corporations, including all the general public, within the town corporate limits, as such limits may be amended from time to time during the term of this franchise, said consent being granted for a term ending December 31, 2032.  
Sec. 2. - Construction, maintenance, operation & relocation of Atmos Energy facilities. 
A.  Atmos Energy shall lay, maintain, construct, operate, and replace its pipes, mains, laterals, and other equipment in a manner to minimize interference with traffic, place or cause to be placed appropriate barriers to mark excavations or obstructions, and restore to approximate original condition all public rights-of-way that it may disturb, at Atmos Energy's sole cost unless Atmos Energy is entitled to reimbursement pursuant to this agreement. In determining the location of the facilities of the town and other users of public right-of-way within town, town shall strive to minimize interference with then existing facilities of Atmos Energy and will require that other users of public rights-of-way minimize interference with existing facilities of Atmos Energy. In the event of a conflict between the location of the proposed facilities of Atmos Energy and the location of the existing facilities of town or other users of public rights-of-way within public rights-of-way that cannot otherwise be resolved, town or an authorized agent of town shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective facilities within the public rights-of-way. 
Atmos Energy or contractors working on behalf of Atmos Energy shall not be required to pay for street cutting permits, street excavation permits or other special permits related to excavations in public rights-of-way in connection with Atmos Energy's operations in public rights-of-way. If town's annual capital improvement plan ("plan") includes projects that will affect Atmos Energy's facilities located in the public rights-of-way, town shall notify Atmos Energy of the plan's availability online, as well as the availability of any updates or changes as soon as the plan, update, or change becomes accessible. Town will endeavor to notify Atmos Energy as soon as reasonably possible of any town projects that will affect Atmos Energy's facilities located in the public rights-of-way. When required by town to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, and/or other facilities lying within public rights-of-way, Atmos Energy shall do so as soon as practically possible with respect to the scope of the project. In no event shall Atmos Energy be required to remove or relocate its facilities in less than 30 days from the time notice is given to Atmos Energy by town, unless town agrees to pay for the removal or relocation at a cost agreed to by both parties and the relocation may be practically accomplished in less than 30 days. 
B.  If town, in constructing its sewers, drainage, water lines, streets, or utilities, should request that Atmos Energy remove or relocate its mains, laterals, and other facilities lying within public rights-of-way, Atmos Energy shall do so at its own expense for facilities that are in conflict, unless such work is for the primary purpose of beautification or accommodating a private developer. Facilities are deemed to be in conflict to the extent that the proposed town facilities are determined by either the town or Atmos Energy to be inconsistent with gas distribution industry standard safe operating practices for existing facilities. Unless Atmos Energy provides agreement in advance, Atmos Energy shall not be required to relocate facilities to a depth greater than the original depth of the facilities or four feet, whichever is deeper, as measured below the new surface elevation. 
When Atmos Energy is required by town to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, and other facilities lying within public rights-of-way to accommodate a request by town, and costs of utility removals or relocations are eligible under federal, state, county, local or other programs for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by Atmos Energy as a result of such removal or relocation, and such reimbursement is required to be handled through town, town shall include Atmos Energy's costs and expenses in any application by town for reimbursement if Atmos Energy submits its cost and expense documentation to town prior to the filing of the application. In the event the town has actual knowledge that such proposal provides reimbursement for utility relocation, the town shall provide reasonable written notice to Atmos Energy of the deadline for Atmos Energy to submit documentation of the costs and expenses of such relocation to town in order for town to submit its application for reimbursement to such program in a timely manner. In the event that the town submits an application resulting in funding and does not provide sufficient written notice to Atmos Energy as set forth in this paragraph, and, as a result, the opportunity for company to receive reimbursement through town from such program of costs and expenses incurred by company as a result of such removal or relocation is lost or forfeited, then the town shall be responsible for 50 percent of the cost of the removal or relocation of Atmos Energy's facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town is under no obligation to make application to any program. 
If Atmos Energy is required by town to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, or other facilities lying within public rights-of-way for any reason other than the construction or reconstruction of sewers, drainage, water lines, streets, or utilities by town, Atmos Energy shall be entitled to reimbursement from town or others of the cost and expense of such removal or relocation. 
C.  When Atmos Energy is required to remove or relocate its mains, laterals or other facilities to accommodate construction by town, without reimbursement from town, Atmos Energy shall have the right to seek recovery of relocation costs as provided for in applicable state and/or federal law. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit, alter, or modify in any way the right of Atmos Energy to seek or recover a surcharge from customers for the cost of relocation pursuant to applicable state and/or federal law. Town shall not oppose recovery of relocation costs when Atmos Energy is required by town to perform relocation. Town shall not require that Atmos Energy document request for reimbursement as a pre-condition to recovery of such relocation costs. Nothwithstanding any provision of this agreement, the town shall have the right to participate and challenge any other capital costs or expenses of Atmos Energy and request full documentation to the full extent provided by state law. 
D.  If town abandons any public right-of-way in which Atmos Energy has facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Atmos Energy's right to maintain its use of the former public right-of-way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public right-of-way is abandoned to reimburse Atmos Energy for all removal or relocation expenses if Atmos Energy is requested and agrees to remove or relocate its facilities following abandonment of the public right-of-way. If the party to whom the town has abandoned public right-of-way requests Atmos Energy to remove or relocate its facilities and Atmos Energy agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another public right-of-way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation. 
E.  If Atmos Energy employees damage the facilities owned by town within the public rights-of-way which are properly located by the town, Atmos Energy shall reimburse such expenses as are necessary to repair town facilities. Atmos Energy agrees to notify the appropriate town official as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of such damage. If town employees damage facilities owned by Atmos Energy within the public rights-of-way which are properly located by Atmos Energy, town shall reimburse such expenses as are necessary to repair Atmos Energy facilities. Town agrees to notify the appropriate personnel of Atmos Energy as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of such damage. 
F.  Atmos Energy shall be required to extend distribution mains in any public rights-of-way up to 50 feet for any one residential customer only if such customer, at a minimum, uses gas for unsupplemented space heating and water heating. Atmos Energy shall not be required to extend transmission mains in any public right-of-way within town or to make a tap on any transmission main within town unless Atmos Energy agrees to such extension by a written agreement between Atmos Energy and a customer.  
Sec. 3. - Indemnity and insurance. 
A.  In consideration of the granting of this franchise, Atmos Energy agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Town, its officers, agents and employees (the "indemnitees") from and against all suits, actions or claims of injury to any person or persons, or damages to any property brought or made for or on account of any death, injuries to, or damages received or sustained by any person or persons or for damage to or loss of property arising out of, or occasioned by Atmos Energy's intentional and/or negligent acts or omissions in connection with Atmos Energy's operations; except that the indemnity provided for in this paragraph shall not apply to any liability determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnitees. It is understood that it is not the intention of the parties hereto to create liability for the benefit of third parties, but that this section shall be solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and shall not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any person or entity. 
B.  Atmos Energy's insurance of its obligations and risks undertaken pursuant to this franchise may be in the form of self-insurance to the extent permitted by applicable law, under an Atmos Energy plan of self-insurance maintained in accordance with sound accounting and risk-management practices or by obtaining insurance as follows:

C.  Atmos Energy will provide proof of insurance in accordance with this franchise within 30 days of the effective date of the franchise. Atmos Energy will not be required to furnish separate proof when applying for permits.  
Sec. 4. - Non-exclusive franchise. 
The rights, privileges, and franchises granted by this ordinance are not to be considered exclusive, and town hereby expressly reserves the right to grant, at any time, like privileges, rights, and franchises as it may see fit to any other person or corporation for the purpose of transporting, delivering, distributing, or selling gas to and for town and the inhabitants thereof.  
Sec. 5. - Reasonable charges, rules and regulations. 
In addition to the rates charged for gas supplied, Atmos Energy may make and enforce reasonable charges, rules, and regulations for service rendered in the conduct of its business including a charge for services rendered in the inauguration of natural gas service, and may require, before furnishing service, the execution of a contract therefore. Atmos Energy shall have the right to contract with each customer with reference to the installation of, and payment for, any and all of the gas piping from the connection thereof with Atmos Energy's main in the streets or alleys to and throughout the consumer's premises. Atmos Energy shall own, operate and maintain all service lines, which are defined as the supply lines extending from Atmos Energy's main to the customer's meter where gas is measured by Atmos Energy. The consumer shall own, operate, and maintain all yard lines and house piping. Yard lines are defined as the underground supply lines extending from the point of connection with Atmos Energy's customer meter to the point of connection with consumer's house piping.  
Sec. 6. - Reliability of service. 
Atmos Energy shall furnish reasonably adequate service to the public at reasonable rates and charges therefore; and Atmos Energy shall maintain its property, equipment and appliances in good order and condition.  
Sec. 7. - Payments to town. 
A.  Atmos Energy, its successors and assigns, agrees to pay and town agrees to accept, on or before April 1, 2013 ("initial payment"), and on or before the same day of each succeeding year ("succeeding payments") during the term of this franchise, the last payment being made on the 1st day of April, 2032 a sum of money which shall be equivalent to five percent of the gross revenues, as defined in 7.B below, received by Atmos Energy during the preceding calendar year.

(1)  All revenues received by Atmos Energy from the sale of gas to all classes of customers (excluding gas sold to governmental customers or gas sold to another gas utility in the town for resale to its customers within town) within the town; 
(2)  All revenues received by Atmos Energy from the transportation of gas through the System of Atmos Energy within the town to customers located within the town (excluding any gas transported to another gas utility in town for resale to its customers within town); 
(3)  The value of gas transported by Atmos Energy for transport customers through the system of Atmos Energy within the town ("third party sales")(excluding the value of any gas transported to another gas utility in Town for resale to its customers within town), with the value of such gas to be established by utilizing Atmos Energy's monthly weighted average cost of gas charged to industrial customers in the Mid-Tex division, as reasonably near the time as the transportation service is performed; and 
(4)  "Gross revenues" shall also include fees collected pursuant to this ordinance and the following "miscellaneous charges": charges to connect, disconnect, or reconnect gas; charges to handle returned checks from consumers within the Town; and contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). Calculation and payment of franchise fees based on CIAC shall be (1) calculated on an annual calendar year basis, i.e., from January 1 through December 31 of each calendar year; and (2) paid at least once annually on or before April 30 each year based on the total CIAC recorded during the preceding calendar year. The last payment of franchise fees based on CIAC shall be on or before April 30, 2033 for the period January 1 through December 31, 2032. 
(5)  "Gross revenues" shall not include: 
(a)  Revenues billed but not ultimately collected or received by Atmos Energy; 
(b)  The revenue of any affiliate or subsidiary of Atmos Energy; 
(c)  Sales tax; 
(d)  Interest or investment income earned by Atmos Energy; and 
(e)  Monies received from the lease or sale of real or personal property, provided, however, that this exclusion does not apply to the lease of facilities within the public rights-of-way. 
C.  The initial payment for the rights and privileges herein provided shall be for the privilege period January 1 through December 31, 2013, and each succeeding payment shall be for the privilege period of the calendar year in which the payment is made. 
It is also expressly agreed that the aforesaid payments shall be in lieu of any and all other and additional occupation taxes, franchise taxes or charges (whether levied as an ad valorem, special, or other character of tax or charge), municipal license, permit, and inspection fees, bonds, street taxes, and street or alley rentals or charges, and all other and additional municipal taxes, charges, levies, fees, and rentals of whatsoever kind and character that town may now impose or hereafter levy and collect from Atmos Energy or Atmos Energy's agents, excepting only the usual general or special ad valorem taxes that town is authorized to levy and impose upon real and personal property. If the town does not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing sums of money shall be in lieu of taxes, licenses, fees, street or alley rentals or charges, easement or franchise taxes or charges aforesaid, then town agrees that it will apply so much of said sums of money paid as may be necessary to satisfy Atmos Energy's obligations, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals, easement or franchise taxes or charges aforesaid. 
D.  Effect of other municipal franchise ordinance fees accepted and paid by Atmos Energy. If Atmos Energy should at any time after the effective date of this ordinance agree to a new municipal franchise ordinance, or renew an existing municipal franchise ordinance, with another municipality in Atmos Energy's Mid-Tex Division, which municipal franchise ordinance determines the franchise fee owed to that municipality for the use of its public rights-of-way in a manner that, if applied to the town, would result in a franchise fee greater than the amount otherwise due town under this ordinance, then the franchise fee to be paid by Atmos Energy to town pursuant to this ordinance may, at the election of the town, be increased so that the amount due and to be paid is equal to the amount that would be due and payable to town were the franchise fee provisions of that other franchise ordinance applied to town. The town acknowledges that the exercise of this right is conditioned upon the town's acceptance of all terms and conditions of the other municipal franchise in toto. The town may request waiver of certain terms and company may grant, in its sole reasonable discretion, such waiver. 
E.  Atmos Energy franchise fee recovery tariff. 
(1)  Atmos Energy may file with the town a tariff or tariff amendment(s) to provide for the recovery of the franchise fees under this agreement. 
(2)  Town agrees that (i)as regulatory authority, it will adopt and approve the ordinance, rates or tariff which provide for 100 percent recovery of such franchise fees as part of Atmos Energy's rates; (ii) if the town intervenes in any regulatory proceeding before a federal or state agency in which the recovery of Atmos Energy's franchise fees is an issue, the town will take an affirmative position supporting 100% recovery of such franchise fees by Atmos Energy; and (iii) in the event of an appeal of any such regulatory proceeding in which the town has intervened, the town will take an affirmative position in any such appeals in support of the 100 percent recovery of such franchise fees by Atmos Energy. 
(3)  Town agrees that it will take no action, nor cause any other person or entity to take any action, to prohibit the recovery of such franchise fees by Atmos Energy. 
F.  Lease of facilities within public rights-of-way. Atmos Energy shall have the right to lease, license or otherwise grant to a party other than Atmos Energy the use of its facilities within the town's public rights-of-way provided (i) Atmos Energy first notifies the town of the name of the lessee, licensee or user; the type of service(s) intended to be provided through the facilities; and the name and telephone number of a contact person associated with such lessee, licensee or user; and (ii) Atmos Energy makes the franchise fee payment due on the revenues from such lease pursuant to section 7 of this ordinance. 
This authority to lease facilities within public rights-of-way shall not affect any such lessee, licensee or user's obligation, if any, to pay franchise fees.  
Sec. 8. - Acceptance of franchise. 
In order to accept this franchise, Atmos Energy must file with the town secretary its written acceptance of this franchise ordinance within 60 days after its final passage and approval by town. If such written acceptance of this franchise ordinance is not filed by Atmos Energy, the franchise ordinance shall be rendered null and void. 
When this franchise ordinance becomes effective, all previous ordinances of town granting franchises for gas delivery purposes that were held by Atmos Energy shall be automatically canceled and annulled, and shall be of no further force and effect.  
Sec. 9. - Paragraph headings; construction. 
The paragraph headings contained in this ordinance are for convenience only and shall in no way enlarge or limit the scope or meaning of the various and several paragraphs hereof. Both parties have participated in the preparation of this ordinance and this ordinance shall not be construed either more or less strongly against or for either party.  
Sec. 10. - Effective date. 
If Atmos Energy accepts this ordinance, it becomes effective as of January 1, 2013.

ORDINANCE NO. 47-96 
An ordinance amending the existing franchise between the Town of Flower Mound and Texas Utilities Electric Company to provide for a different consideration; providing an effective date; providing for acceptance by Texas Utilities Electric Company; and finding and determining that the meeting at which this ordinance is passed is open to the public as required by law. 
Whereas, Texas Utilities Electric Company (hereinafter called "TU Electric") is engaged in the business of providing electric utility service within the Town of Flower Mound (hereinafter called "town") and is using the public streets, alleys, grounds, and rights-of-way within the town for that purpose under the terms of a franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of the town and duly accepted by TU Electric; and 
Whereas, TU Electric has, pursuant to said franchise ordinance, been paying to the town a sum equal to three percent of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the town for the rights and privileges set forth in said franchise ordinance and, in addition thereto, has reimbursed the town for its ratemaking expenses pursuant to Section 2.106 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995; and 
Whereas, the town and TU Electric desire to amend said franchise ordinance to provide for a different consideration to consist of a sum equal to four percent of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the town; which different consideration includes, among other things, TU Electric's obligation to reimburse the town for its ratemaking and other regulatory expenses to be incurred by the town involving the regulation of TU Electric; 
Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Town Council of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas:  
Section 1. - Rates change. 
The consideration payable by TU Electric for the rights and privileges granted to TU Electric by the franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this town and duly accepted by TU Electric is hereby changed to be four percent of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the corporate limits of the town, said changed percentage to be applied to said gross receipts beginning on the first day of the month immediately following the date on which TU Electric accepts this ordinance, and being payable as specified in said franchise ordinance and based upon the same time periods as specified in said franchise ordinance and being payment for the said rights and privileges during the period specified in said franchise ordinance, said payment being in lieu of and shall be accepted as payment for all of TU Electric's obligations to pay municipal charges, fees, rentals, pole rentals, wire taxes, inspection fees, easement taxes, franchise taxes, certain regulatory expenses under Section 2.106 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995 or any similar or successor law, or other charges and taxes of every kind, except ad valorem taxes, sales and use taxes, and special taxes and assessments for public improvements.  
Section 2. - One-time payment; calculation. 
TU Electric shall make a one-time payment hereunder for the purpose of making the changed consideration as specified in section 1 hereof effective as specified in said section 1 without altering the payment dates specified in said franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this town and duly accepted by TU Electric, said one-time payment being due and payable 30 days after TU Electric's acceptance of this ordinance as provided in section 7 hereof, and being a sum calculated as follows: (a) TU Electric shall determine the monthly average of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the town during the period upon which the most recent franchise payment made to the town prior to the date determined in accordance with section 1 hereof was based; (b) the said monthly average of its said gross receipts shall be multiplied by one percent; and (c) the product so calculated shall be multiplied by the number of whole months from the date determined in accordance with section 1 hereof through the last day of the last month of the period for which the most recent franchise payment made to the town prior to said date determined in accordance with section 1 hereof was made.  
Section 3. - Reimbursement of expenses. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 1 hereof, if TU Electric files general rate cases and the town incurs cumulative expenses, otherwise reimbursable by TU Electric under Section 2.106 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995 or similar or successor law in excess of $4 million, then in such event, TU Electric shall reimburse all of the expenses incurred by the town in connection with all general rate cases filed during the period beginning with the effective date hereof and ending on September 30, 2008, in excess of said $4 million. The term "general rate case" as used in this ordinance means a rate case initiated by TU Electric in which it seeks to increase its rates charged to a substantial number of its customer classes in the town and elsewhere in its system and in which TU Electric's overall revenues are in setting such rates. The town agrees to exercise reasonable best efforts, considering the facts and circumstances, to keep its expenses on average to under $1,000,000.00 per general rate case.  
Section 4. - Ratemaking expenses; reimbursement. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1 hereof, TU Electric will continue to reimburse the town's ratemaking expenses, if any, in connection with the appeal and any remand of Public Utility Commission of Texas Docket No. 9300 that are otherwise reimbursable under Section 2.106 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995, but will not continue to reimburse the town's ratemaking expenses, if any, in connection with Public Utility Commission of Texas Docket No. 11735; the town hereby agrees that any ratemaking expenses incurred in connection with said Docket No. 11735 that the town incurs on appeal or on remand of said Docket No. 11735 will be the Town's sole responsibility and further agrees in the events that the town is a participant in the join intervention of cities managed by the steering committee of TU Electric Service Area Cities intervening in Docket No. 11735, that the town decides to continue to participate with the steering committee in such appeal of said order, and TU Electric is required to reimburse said steering committee for ratemaking expenses under Section 2.106 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995 that are incurred on appeal or remand of said Docket No. 11735to reimburse TU Electric the town's share of reimbursable expenses related to said appeal and remand and owed by TU Electric to said steering committee determined by the methodology chosen by the said steering committee (the town to notify TU Electric of the method so chosen by the steering committee prior to the submission of an invoice by the steering committee for the payment by TU Electric of said reimbursable expenses related to said appeal or remand)  
Section 5. - Formula for amount calculated. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3 hereof, in the event that the City of Dallas incurs cumulative expenses in connection with general rate cases filed by TU Electric during the period beginning with the effective date hereof and ending September 30, 2008, in excess of $4 million and TU Electric reimburses the City of Dallas such excess, then, in that event, TU Electric will reimburse the town's reasonable expenses actually incurred that are otherwise reimbursable under Section 2.106 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1995, Article 1446c-0, V.A.T.S. (The "PURA"), limited, however to an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: 
A = [(B - $4,000,000.00) - B] × C, 
where: 
A = The amount reimbursable to the town; 
B = The total amount of expenses incurred by the City of Dallas prior to September 30, 2008, in connection with general rate cases filed by TU Electric, which expenses would be reimbursable under Section 2.106 of the PURA to the City of Dallas except for the terms of TU Electric's current franchise with the City of Dallas, but excluding all such expenses incurred in connection with Public Utility Commission of Texas Dockets Nos. 9300 and 11735; and 
C = The total amount of expenses incurred by the town prior to September 30, 2008, in connection with general rate cases filed by TU Electric, which expenses would be reimbursable under Section 2.106 of the PURA except for the terms of this franchise amendment but excluding all such expenses incurred in connection with Public Utility Commission of Texas Dockets Nos. 9300 and 11735; and  
Section 6. - Ordinance to remain in full force and effect. 
In all respects, except as specifically and amended by this ordinance, the said franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this town and duly accepted by TU Electric shall remain in full force and effect according to its terms until said franchise ordinance terminates as provided therein.  
Section 7. - Effective date; acceptance. 
This ordinance shall take effect from and after its final passage and TU Electric's acceptance. TU Electric shall, within 15 days from the passage of this ordinance, file its written acceptance of this ordinance with the office of the town secretary in substantially the following form: 
To the Honorable Mayor and Town Council:

ORDINANCE NO. 18-99 
An ordinance of the Town Council of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas, approving rate schedules for Texas Utilities Electric Company, providing an effective date therefor, providing conditions under which such rate schedules may be changed, modified, amended or withdrawn, finding and determining that the meeting at which this ordinance is passed is open to the public as required by law. 
Now therefore, be it ordained by the Town Council of the Town of Flower Mound, Texas, that:  
Section 1. - Time-of-use rate schedules. 
On January 15, 1999, Texas Utilities Electric Company (hereinafter referred to as "TU Electric") filed with the governing body of this municipality a statement of intent and application to implement within the corporate limits of this municipality proposed new rate schedules that provide additional rate options for its customers, which options are entirely voluntary on the part of the customer, namely its proposed rate GTU-M-general service time-of-use-municipality, proposed rate RTU 1-M-residential time-of-use service-municipality, and proposed rate GTUC-M-general service time-of-use voluntary curtailable-municipality (said three proposed new rate schedules hereinafter collectively referred to as the "time-of-use rate schedules").  
Section 2. - Approval. 
The time-of-use rate schedules are hereby approved, and TU Electric is authorized to render service and to collect charges as specified in the time-of-use rate schedules from its customers electing to receive electric service under said time-of-use rate schedules within the corporate limits of this municipality until such time as said rate schedules may be changed, modified, amended or withdrawn with the approval of the governing body of this municipality.  
Section 3. - Effective time period. 
The time-of-use rate schedules herein approved shall be effective from and after the final passage and approval of this ordinance.  
Section 4. - Notice. 
The filing of said time-of-use rate schedules shall constitute notice to the consumers of electricity within its municipality of the availability and application of such time-of-use rate schedules.  
Section 5. - Recovery of revenue prohibited. 
TU Electric shall not seek any additional rate or surcharge mechanism to recover any revenues lost on account of the application of these time-of-use rates, and there shall be no imputed revenues on account of any reduction in TU Electric's revenues that may result from the application of these time-of-use rates.  
Section 6. - Riders. 
The rate reductions approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in Docket No. 18490 shall be applied to the time-of-use rates approved herein, such that rider RRD shall be applicable to rate RTU 1-M, rider GSRD shall be applied to all customers taking secondary service under either rate GTU-M designated as GTU-M-SEC or under rate GTUC-M designated as GTUC-M-SEC, and rider RD shall be applied to all other customers on rate GTU-M or rate GTUC-M.  
Section 7. - Base rate case; rate classes. 
In its next general base rate case in which the time-of-use rates herein approved are at issue, TU Electric will either (a) include all customers taking service under rate GTUC or GTUC-M during the test year involved in such base rate case as a separate rate class in its cost allocation study, or (b) include in its cost allocation study the load and revenue data applicable to each GTUC or GTUC-M customer taking service under rate GTUC or GTU-CM during the test year involved in such base rate case with the load and revenue data of the rate class applicable to such GTUC or GTUC-M customer immediately prior to such customer's taking service under rate GTUC or GTUC-M.

Further, the Grantee agrees to pay to the Town of Flower Mound, Texas, on or before April 1, 2007, and on or before the same day of each succeeding year during the life of this franchise, a sum of money equal to four percent (4%) of the Gross Revenues for the previous calendar year, for the use of the streets, highways, easements, alleys, parks, and all other public lands and places within the Town of Flower Mound, Texas, for the Grantee's poles, wires, conduits, pipes, fixtures and all other equipment and appurtenances related to its electric system in the Town. Such payment shall be in lieu of any other tax or increased rate of tax, or other imposition, assessment or charges, except ad valorem taxes.

The Grantee is hereby authorized to surcharge to customers within the Town all or any portion of the Gross Revenues assessment. All bills for services rendered within the Town may be adjusted by the same percentage as the Gross Revenues assessment specified herein, less any percentage that is recovered by the Grantee through base rates or other charges. 
C.  Grantee Franchise Fee Recovery Tariff 
1.  To the extent required by applicable law, Grantee may file a tariff amendment(s) to provide for the recovery of the franchise fee payable hereunder. 
2.  The Town agrees: 
a.  to the extent the Town acts as regulatory authority, to adopt and approve that portion of any tariff which provides for 100 percent (100%) recovery (or such lesser amount requested by the Grantee) of the franchise fee payable hereunder as part of the Grantee's rates; 
b.  in the event the Town intervenes in any regulatory proceeding before a federal or state agency in which the recovery of such franchise fees is an issue, the Town will take an affirmative position supporting the 100 percent (100%) recovery of such franchise fees by the Grantee; and 
c.  in the event of an appeal of any such regulatory proceeding in which the Town has intervened, the Town will take an affirmative position in any such appeals in support of the 100 percent (100%) recovery of such franchise fees by the Grantee.

Section 9. - Rights nonexclusive.

Section 12. - Validity. 
If any section, sentence, clause or phase of this ordinance is for any reason held to be illegal, ultra vires or unconstitutional, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this ordinance.  
Section 13. - Effective date. 
The fact that the Town of Flower Mound, Texas, is in immediate need of the relief afforded by the provisions of this ordinance creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity requiring and demanding that any and all rules requiring ordinances to be read and repassed at more than one meeting be suspended, and that this ordinance take effect immediately upon its passage, and it is so ordained. 
Passed and approved on December 2, 1965.

This authority to lease facilities within the public rights-of-way shall not affect any such lessee, licensee, or user's obligation, if any, to pay franchise fees to the town.  
Sec. 3. - Purpose. 
The provisions set forth in this ordinance represent the terms and conditions under which cooperative shall construct, re-construct, extend, repair, remove, operate and maintain the system within the public rights-of-way of the town. In the franchise granted herein, the town does not in any manner surrender or waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the Constitution and statutes of the State of Texas as the same may be amended, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the town, except as may be set out herein. Not included in the franchise granted herein are any facilities (including any equipment attached in any way to Cooperative's facilities, whether owned by the cooperative or not) that provide data delivery, cable service, telephone service, and/or any other service or product unrelated to the cooperative's transmittal and delivery of electricity.  
Sec. 4. - Operation, construction and maintenance of electric distribution system. 
A.  Cooperative's system shall be initially constructed so as not to unreasonably interfere with any existing publicly-owned or publicly-franchised water and wastewater lines, gas lines, storm sewer lines, open drainage areas, cable, fiber optic cable, roadways, sidewalks, alleys, traffic control devices, public signs, or any other publicly-owned or publicly-franchised facility. The town shall have the right at any time to order and require cooperative to remove and abate any part of its electric distribution system that is unnecessarily dangerous to life or property, and in case cooperative, after notice, fails or refuses to act within a reasonable time, the town shall have the power to remove or abate the same at the expense of cooperative, all without compensation or liability for damages to cooperative. 
B.  Permits. 
1.  Cooperative's facilities shall interfere as little as reasonably possible with town-owned public works facilities and with vehicular and pedestrian use of public rights-of-way. 
2.  Except as provided in section 4(B)(3), cooperative shall not be required to submit a permit application for the placement of facilities outside of the public rights-of-way, however, cooperative shall provide detailed drawings, in accordance with cooperative's customary practice, reflecting cooperative's installations on private property so that town may verify compliance with town ordinances related to zoning, development, building regulations, and setbacks, and for easement verification. 
3.  Cooperative shall submit a permit application to town for the placement of new facilities, for upgrade or augmentation of existing facilities, or for replacement of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way, in utility easements granted or dedicated to the town on private property for installation of water, wastewater or drainage facilities, in utility easements on private property that contain water, wastewater or drainage facilities owned by the town, or in utility easements immediately adjacent to and adjoining public rights-of-way. Such permit application shall include: 
(a)  Complete plans and detailed drawings reflecting compliance with all applicable zoning, development, and building requirements of the town; and 
(b)  All additional information requested by town reasonably related to the permit request. 
4.  Except as otherwise provided in this section 4(B), following the submission of a permit application described herein, notice of town's approval or denial of cooperative's request for a permit shall be provided in accordance with town's usual procedures for processing of permit applications. 
5.  Town shall endeavor to complete its review of cooperative's application within 30 business days (excluding town holidays) after town's receipt of the permit application and, if applicable, any additional information requested by Town reasonably related to the permit request. However, the time associated with Cooperative's provision of a response to town's request for additional information pursuant to section 4(B)(3) above shall not be counted against the 30 business day time period. 
6.  If town has not approved or denied cooperative's request for a permit within 30 business days (excluding town holidays) after: 
(a)  Receipt by town of the permit application (if no additional information was requested by town), or 
(b)  Receipt by town of all additional information requested by town reasonably related to the permit request, then upon written request by cooperative, the town's department director in charge of the permit process shall, within 15 days after such written request, approve (and issue) or deny the permit in question. For good cause, town's department director may by written notice to cooperative extend such 15-day time period to approve or deny cooperative's application for up to an additional 30 days. 
7.  Cooperative may proceed with the placement of the facilities described in its permit application if written notice of town's approval or denial of cooperative's request for a permit is not provided within 15 days (or such additional number of days if extended by town's department director) of the date of Cooperative's request pursuant to section 4(B)(6) above. 
8.  A permit application for new overhead facilities not directly associated with a line extension for new electric service, or for overhead facilities to augment, upgrade, replace, or repair facilities within a public right-of-way on existing poles (existing pole lines) containing overhead facilities, may not be denied for aesthetic reasons. 
9.  A permit application approved by the town may be valid for a period of time consistent with the amount of time reasonably required for the cooperative to perform the work described in the permit application, and may be extended by cooperative for such time as reasonably required to complete such work upon town's receipt of cooperative's verification in writing of the need for such an extension. 
10.  In determining the location of the cooperative's new facilities within the town, the cooperative shall minimize interferences with then-existing or documented planned underground structures of the town or with the existing facilities of other users of the public rights-of-way. In determining the location of the facilities of the town and other utility franchisees and other users of the public rights-of-way within the town, the town shall take reasonable steps to minimize the interference with existing facilities of the cooperative and shall require other utility franchisees or users of the public rights-of-way to minimize interference with existing facilities of the cooperative. 
C.  Cooperative's property and operations within the public rights-of-way of the town shall be subject to such reasonable and lawful rules and regulations of the town or other governmental or regulatory authority as may be authorized by applicable law from time to time for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. This ordinance shall in no way affect or impair the rights, obligations or remedies of the parties under the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, or other state or federal law. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party's right to contest, appeal, or file suit with respect to any action or decision of the other party, including ordinances adopted by the town that cooperative believes are contrary to applicable laws. 
D.  Cooperative shall construct, re-construct, extend, repair, remove, maintain, operate and replace its facilities in accordance with its tariff and in conformance with the applicable provisions of the National Electric Safety Code or such comparable standards as may be adopted by the cooperative, provided such comparable standards are not in conflict with the National Electric Safety Code. Cooperative shall comply with applicable laws and standards. 
E.  Town may request that cooperative place new facilities underground, provided that, if cooperative otherwise would, pursuant to its tariff, construct those facilities overhead, the town or property developer shall (a) bear the cost differential between overhead and underground construction and facilities and (b) specify and provide, in compliance with the cooperative's reasonable specifications and requirements, a location for such underground facilities. 
F.  Cooperative and town have agreed that cooperative shall not be obligated to provide maps identifying all cooperative facilities within the town boundaries, provided however, that cooperative agrees to provide reproducible copies of maps showing the location of all cooperative primary electric lines within the public rights-of-way at least annually upon request by town. The maps shall be provided in electronic digital format, if available. In addition, upon request, cooperative shall cooperate with the town by identifying and locating, at locations specified by the town, cooperative's existing facilities such as underground conduits, manholes to access such underground conduits, and other appurtenances and by providing information to the town regarding cooperative's plans for future facilities. Maps provided to town by cooperative shall be maintained as confidential by the town as provided in section 15 hereof. Upon request, the town shall cooperate with the cooperative by identifying and locating, at locations specified by the cooperative, town's existing facilities such as water and sewer lines, storm drains, communications lines, and appurtenances.

Any and all excavations and obstructions in and upon the Public Rights-of-Way and other public places in the Town caused by the Cooperative's operations under the Franchise granted herein shall be repaired and removed as quickly as is reasonably possible, under the circumstances. All excavations shall be repaired in a good and workmanlike manner and restored to at least the condition that existed prior to the excavation. All utilities, irrigation equipment, utility equipment, and any other improvements located in the public rights-of-way and disturbed by the cooperative's operations under the franchise granted herein shall likewise be restored within a reasonable time to as good a condition as existed before the commencement of the work to the satisfaction of the town and in accordance with TCEQ stabilization regulations, as contained in the Texas Administrative Code, as amended. Replacement of sod is to be of like kind, smoothed, shaped, rolled and compacted for proper landscape maintenance. Cooperative warrants that any such restoration work performed in the public rights-of-way shall be in satisfactory condition for a period of two years after completion of restoration, to the extent that such restoration work has not been disturbed by others. In the event that the cooperative fails to repair or restore an excavation site within 14 calendar days after receipt of written notice from the town of a deficiency, the town may, at its option, perform the needed repair or restoration and the cooperative shall promptly reimburse the town for the cost of such repair or restoration. 
H.  Town shall have the right to inspect all reconstruction or installation work and to make such tests as it deems necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this ordinance, or other applicable town ordinances or pertinent provisions of law. 
I.  The public shall be protected by barriers and lights placed, erected, marked and maintained by the cooperative in accordance with standards set forth in the current Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as well as any other applicable local, state and federal requirements. Except for repairs, day-to-day maintenance, or in cases of emergency conditions, work conducted within the public rights-of-way shall require an approved permit issued by the town prior to commencement of work. In no instance shall cooperative be required to pay fees or post bonds related to its use of the public rights-of-way. 
J.  Cooperative shall have the authority to trim or remove trees and vegetation upon or overhanging its system that may endanger or interfere with the system and its operation, and to prevent the vegetation and the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the system. The cooperative's vegetation management practices shall be consistent with the safety requirements for pruning, repairing, maintaining, and removing trees endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (specifically the ANSI A300, titled "Best Management Practices, Utility Pruning of Trees"); NESC Section 218; and state law. Except during an emergency or the recovery after an emergency, cooperative shall notify the town and its residents at least three days prior to entering onto property to perform any tree trimming activities. Within one year after acceptance of the franchise granted herein, and on a yearly basis thereafter, the cooperative will engage in a campaign to educate its customers within the town through bill inserts or other reasonable methods regarding prudent tree selection and planting around power lines. The town will encourage new developments to make prudent tree selection and planting decisions around power lines. 
K.  Upon the written request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the town, cooperative shall remove, raise or lower its wires temporarily to permit the moving of a house, building or other bulky structure. The reasonable expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering shall be paid by the benefitted person or persons and cooperative may require such payment in advance. Cooperative shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice in writing to arrange for such temporary removal, raising or lowering. 
L.  Nothing contained in this ordinance shall be construed to require any pole attachments for electric light or power wires or electrical facilities or systems not provided by cooperative, or any non-electric wires, facilities or systems, to be attached to cooperative's poles or other physical plant. If the town or any other person or entity desires pole attachments for any such electric or non-electric wires, facilities or systems not provided by cooperative, then a further separate, non-contingent agreement shall be prerequisite to such attachments or such use of any trench space. Nothing herein shall prohibit cooperative from requiring reasonable, non-discriminatory terms and from charging just compensation pursuant to a pole attachment or joint use agreement; however, any pole attachment or joint use agreement with a third party shall not be enforceable by the town. 
M.  In areas of the town where the town finds that the public rights-of-way will not readily accommodate further facilities, the town may require cooperative to share trench space with the town or any other person authorized to use such public rights-of-way for the placement of its cables or ducts. Ducts, cables, or wires not owned by cooperative shall be placed in trenches in compliance with applicable safety and construction standards in a manner that does not interfere with cooperative's ducts, conduit, cables or wires. Nothing herein shall prohibit cooperative from requiring reasonable, non-discriminatory terms and from charging just compensation for the use of its facilities or trench space; however, any such agreement with a third party shall not be enforceable by the town. 
N.  The cooperative shall hold itself ready to furnish, subject to section 4(L) above, such space as may be required from time to time by the town upon the poles now owned or hereafter erected by the cooperative in the town for the use of the town's police, fire alarm, communications, and traffic signal systems (for purposes of this section hereafter referred to as "town systems"); provided that such town use and placement shall be in compliance with applicable safety and construction standards and shall not interfere with cooperative's system. The location on the poles of the town systems shall be determined on specific applications for space, at the time the applications are received from the town, and will be allotted in accordance with the National Electrical Safety Code. In its wire construction on cooperative's poles, the town shall comply with the applicable suggestions, standards and requirements of the National Electrical Safety Code and such construction shall not interfere with or cause damage to the cooperative's system. 
O.  Town shall not sell, lease or otherwise make available any rights granted by cooperative to town to use cooperative's facilities to any third party. Such rights are provided solely for the non-commercial, governmental use by the town.  
Sec. 5. - Relocation of facilities. 
A.  The town reserves the right to lay, and permit to be laid, storm, sewer, gas, water, wastewater and other pipe lines, cable, and conduits, or other improvements and to do and permit to be done any underground or overhead work that may be necessary or proper in, across, along, over, or under public rights-of-way occupied by cooperative. 
B.  The town also reserves the right to change in any manner any curb, sidewalk, highway, alley, public way, street, utility lines, storm sewers, drainage basins, drainage ditches, and other public improvements. Upon request by town, cooperative shall relocate, remove, or alter its facilities at its expense whenever such relocation, removal, or alteration is made necessary by public right-of-way or other public improvements, provided that the town shall provide cooperative with at least 30 days prior written notice and shall specify and provide a new location for such facilities within the public rights-of-way. If cooperative believes that the cost is excessive to relocate, remove, or alter its facilities per the town request, cooperative shall have the opportunity to present alternative proposals for the town's consideration. Town may request that cooperative relocate existing overhead facilities underground when cooperative is required to relocate facilities under this section 5(B), provided that the town or property developer shall (a) bear the cost differential between overhead and underground construction and facilities and (b) specify and provide, in compliance with the cooperative's reasonable specifications and requirements, a new location for such facilities. 
C.  When cooperative is required by town to remove or relocate its poles, towers, conduits, cables, and other facilities to accommodate public right-of-way improvements, and cooperative is eligible under federal, state, county, town or other local agencies or programs for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by cooperative as a result of such removal or relocation and such reimbursement is required to be handled through town, the cooperative's costs and expenses shall be included in any application by town for reimbursement, if cooperative submits its cost and expense documentation to town prior to the filing of the application. Town shall provide reasonable notice to cooperative of the deadline for cooperative to submit documentation of the costs and expenses of such removal or relocation to town. 
D.  If a public right-of-way in which cooperative has facilities is proposed to be vacated, eliminated, discontinued, or closed, cooperative shall be notified of same at least 60 days prior to such event, and all rights of cooperative under this ordinance to use same shall terminate, provided that a reasonable alternate route within the public right-of-way is available for relocation of such facilities. Cooperative shall, as soon as reasonably possible, remove the electric distribution system from such public right-of-way unless cooperative obtains any necessary easements from the affected property owner to use the former public right-of-way, or a court orders the provision of such easements. Where reasonably possible and to the extent consistent with the treatment of other utility facilities in the former public right-of-way, town shall reserve easements for cooperative to continue to use the former public right-of-way. Cooperative shall bear the cost of any removal or relocation of the electric distribution system unless the vacation, elimination, discontinuance or closure is primarily for the benefit of a private party, in which case the private party shall bear such costs. 
E.  If the town requires the cooperative to adapt or conform its facilities, or in any manner to alter, relocate, or change its property to enable any other entity to use, or use with greater convenience, said public rights-of-way, the cooperative shall not be bound to make such changes until such other entity shall have undertaken, with good and sufficient bond, to reimburse the cooperative for any costs, loss, or expense which will be caused by, or arises out of such change, alteration, or relocation of cooperative's property or facilities.  
Sec. 6. - Indemnity. 
A.  In consideration of the franchise granted herein, cooperative shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold the town, and its past and present officers, agents, and employees (the "indemnitees") harmless against any and all liability arising from any claim, lawsuit, judgments, or action brought or made for or on account of any death, injuries to, or damages received or sustained by any person or persons or for damage to or loss of property arising out of, or occasioned by cooperative's or any of its officers, agents, or employees, intentional and/or negligent acts or omissions in connection with cooperative's construction, maintenance and operation of cooperative's system in the public rights-of-way, including any court costs, expenses and defenses thereof. 
B.  This indemnity shall only apply to the extent that the loss, damage or injury is attributable to the negligence or wrongful act or omission of the cooperative, its officers, agents or employees, and does not apply to the extent such loss, damage or injury is attributable to the negligence or wrongful act or omission of the town, or the town's agents, representatives or employees or any other person or entity. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the cooperative and the town. 
C.  In the event of joint and concurrent negligence or fault of both the cooperative and the town, responsibility and indemnity, if any, shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the town under Texas law and without waiving any of the defenses of the parties under Texas law. Further, in the event of joint and concurrent negligence or fault of both the cooperative and the town, responsibility for all costs of defense shall be apportioned between the town and cooperative based upon the comparative fault of each. 
D.  In fulfilling its obligations to defend and indemnify town, cooperative shall have the right to select defense counsel, subject to town's approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Cooperative shall retain defense counsel within seven business days of town's written notice that town is invoking its right to indemnification under this section 6. If cooperative fails to retain counsel within such time period, town shall have the right to retain defense counsel on its own behalf, and cooperative shall be liable for all reasonable defense costs incurred by town.  
Sec. 7. - Liability insurance. 
Cooperative shall, at its sole cost and expense, obtain, maintain, or cause to be maintained, and provide, throughout the term of the franchise granted herein, insurance in the amounts, types and coverages set forth below. Such insurance may be in the form of self-insurance to the extent not precluded by applicable law or by obtaining insurance, as follows: 
A.  Commercial general or excess liability on an occurrence or claims made form with minimum limits of not less than $5,000,000.00 per occurrence and not less than $10,000,000.00 aggregate. To the extent that coverage is maintained on a claims made form, the minimum limits are not less than $10,000,000.00 per occurrence and not less than $20,000,000.00 aggregate. This coverage shall include the following: 
1.  Products/completed operations to be maintained for the warranty period specified in section 4(G), provided however that no bond shall be required. 
2.  Personal and advertising injury. 
3.  Contractual liability. 
4.  Explosion, collapse, or underground (XCU) hazards. 
B.  Automobile liability coverage with a minimum policy limit of not less than $1,000,000.00 combined single limit each accident. This coverage shall include all owned, hired and non-owned automobiles. 
C.  Statutory workers' compensation benefits in accordance with the statutes and regulations of the State of Texas. Cooperative must provide the town with a waiver of subrogation for workers' compensation claims. 
D.  Cooperative must name the town, which includes all authorities, commissions, divisions, and departments, as well as elected and appointed officials, agents, and volunteers, as additional insureds under the coverage required herein, except workers' compensation coverage. The certificate of insurance must state that the town is an additional insured. 
E.  Cooperative will require its contractors and subcontractors performing work within the public rights-of-way to maintain, at their sole cost and expense, commercial general or excess liability on an occurrence or claims made form with minimum limits of not less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and not less than $2,000,000.00 aggregate. Such insurance shall be required under the same conditions as specified herein for cooperative. Cooperative will maintain at all times, and will provide to town upon request, proof of its contractors' and subcontractors' compliance with this requirement. 
F.  The cooperative will provide proof of insurance in accordance with this ordinance within 30 days of the effective date hereof and annually thereafter. Cooperative will not be required to furnish separate proof when applying for permits. 
G.  All polices shall be endorsed to read: 
"THIS POLICY WILL NOT BE CANCELLED OR NON-RENEWED WITHOUT 30 DAYS ADVANCE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE TOWN EXCEPT WHEN THIS POLICY IS BEING CANCELLED FOR NONPAYMENT OF PREMIUM, IN WHICH CASE TEN (10) DAYS ADVANCE WRITTEN NOTICE IS REQUIRED.  
Sec. 8. - Non-exclusive franchise. 
The franchise granted herein is not exclusive, and nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to prevent the town from granting other like or similar rights, privileges and franchises to any other person, firm, or corporation.  
Sec. 9. - Compensation to the town. 
A.  In consideration of the grant of said right, privilege and franchise by the town and as full payment for the right, privilege and franchise of using and occupying the said public rights-of-way, cooperative shall pay to the town a franchise fee as set forth herein ("franchise fee"). 
1.  The franchise fee shall be in lieu of any and all occupation taxes, assessments, municipal charges, fees, easement taxes, franchise taxes, license, permit and inspection fees or charges, street taxes, bonds, street or alley rentals, and all other taxes, charges, levies, fees and rentals of whatsoever kind and character which the town may impose or hereafter be authorized or empowered to levy and collect, excepting only the usual general or special ad valorem taxes which the town is authorized to levy and impose upon real and personal property, sales and use taxes, and special assessments for public improvements. 
2.  The franchise fee on gross revenues and CIAC shall be paid quarterly, within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter (i.e., by May 15, August 15, November 15, and February 15 of each year of this franchise term); and the franchise fee on pole attachment revenue shall be paid annually by May 15. 
3.  Quarterly payments shall be a sum comprised of the following: 
(a)  A sum equal to five percent of gross revenues received by cooperative for the immediately preceding calendar quarter; and 
(b)  A sum equal to four percent of CIAC received by cooperative for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. 
4.  The franchise fee on pole attachment revenue shall be four percent of pole attachment revenue received by cooperative for the immediately preceding calendar year. 
5.  Payments shall continue in like manner for any extension of the franchise granted herein as provided in section 13 hereof. 
B.  With each payment of compensation required by section 9(A), cooperative shall furnish to the town a statement, executed by an authorized officer of cooperative or designee, in sufficient detail to show how each component of the payment described herein was arrived at and how the amount paid to the town was determined for the pertinent quarter. 
C.  If either party discovers that cooperative has failed to pay the entire or correct amount of compensation due, the correct amount shall be determined by mutual agreement between the town and cooperative and the town shall be paid by cooperative within 30 calendar days of such determination or such additional time as mutually agreed to by the town and cooperative. Any overpayment to the town through error or otherwise will, at the sole option of the town, either be refunded or offset against the next payment due from cooperative. Acceptance by the town of any payment due under this section shall not be deemed to be a waiver by the town of any breach of this ordinance, nor shall the acceptance by the town of any such payments preclude the town from later establishing that a larger amount was actually due or from collecting any balance due to the town. 
D.  Interest on late payments and underpayments shall be calculated in accordance with the interest rate for customer deposits established by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in accordance with Texas Utilities Code § 183.003, as amended, for the time period involved. 
E.  No taxes, fees, or other payments by cooperative to the town, including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, shall reduce the franchise fees payable to the town hereunder, except as agreed to in writing by the town in section 9. 
F.  Within 30 days after the effective date of this ordinance, the town shall provide cooperative (at the notice address specified in section 18) with maps clearly showing the location of the boundaries of the town. Within 30 days after town annexes property into, or disannexes property from, the territory of town, town shall provide cooperative (at the notice address specified in section 18) with maps clearly showing the location of the boundaries of such annexed or disannexed property. Within 60 days, or such additional time as mutually agreed to by the town and cooperative, after cooperative's receipt by certified mail of: (i) written notice from the town that the town has annexed territory into the town; and (ii) Maps showing clearly the areas annexed, the cooperative shall revise its accounting records to include the annexed territory, and cooperative's customers therein, within the town. 
After such time period, each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered by cooperative to each retail customer whose consuming facility's point of delivery is located within such annexed area shall be included in the calculation of the amount described in section 9(A) above. 
G.  Cooperative is hereby authorized to surcharge to customers within the town all or any portion of the franchise fee that is the subject of this ordinance. All bills for service rendered within the town may be adjusted so as to recover the franchise fee that is the subject of this ordinance, less any percentage that is recovered by cooperative through base rates or other charges.  
Sec. 10. - Accounting matters. 
A.  Cooperative shall keep accurate books of account at its principal office for the purpose of determining the franchise fee amount due to the town under this ordinance. Cooperative shall retain such books, records, and documents and other evidence pertaining to the franchise granted herein and franchise fee payments due hereunder for a period of not less than five years, except if an audit is in progress or audit findings are yet unresolved, in which case records shall be kept until all audit tasks are completed and resolved. Each of the terms "books," "records," "documents," and "other evidence" as used herein shall be construed to include electronic files. 
B.  The town may conduct an audit or other inquiry in relation to a franchise fee payment made by cooperative or may pursue a cause of action in relation to cooperative's payment of any franchise fee only if such audit, inquiry, or pursuit of a cause of action concerns a payment made less than two years before the commencement of such audit, inquiry, or pursuit of a cause of action. Provided, the town shall not, after the effective date of this ordinance, initiate an audit of or seek any other remedies related to the franchise fee payments by the cooperative for any period prior to the effective date of this ordinance. The town may, if it sees fit, upon reasonable notice to the cooperative, examine, audit, and obtain copies of the books and records of the cooperative related to the franchise fee. Cooperative shall make available all requested books, records, documents and other evidence within 30 calendar days of town's written request for same. 
C.  If the results of any audit indicate that cooperative (i) paid the correct franchise fee, (ii) overpaid the franchise fee and is entitled to a refund or credit, or (iii) underpaid the franchise fee by five percent or less, then the town shall pay the costs of the audit. If the results of the audit indicate the cooperative underpaid the franchise fee by more than five percent, then the cooperative shall pay the reasonable costs of the audit. 
D.  Upon the reasonable request of the town, the cooperative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the auditor at the cooperative's offices where such records are maintained and such personnel are located, during the cooperative's regular business hours and upon reasonable notice, such personnel and records as the cooperative, in its reasonable discretion, determines are necessary or appropriate to the town's request in order to complete such audit, and shall make no charge to the town therefor; provided, however, any copy expenses or other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the cooperative as a result of requests by the town or its auditor, shall be the responsibility of the town and the town shall promptly pay the reasonable cost thereof to the cooperative. 
1.  If as the result of any town audit, cooperative is refunded/credited for an overpayment or pays the town for an underpayment of the franchise fee, such refund/credit or payment shall be made pursuant to the terms established in sections 9(C) and 9(D). 
2.  If as a result of a subsequent audit, initiated within two years of an audit which resulted in cooperative making a payment to the town due to an underpayment of the franchise fee of more than five percent, cooperative makes another payment to the town due to an underpayment of the franchise fee of more than five percent, the town may also recover interest on the total amount of underpayment at the interest rate in effect on the date of the invoice (calculated as provided in Section 9(D) hereof), plus two percent on the entire amount from the date of invoice. 
3.  If the results of the audit indicate that the cooperative underpaid the franchise fee by more than five percent, and the cooperative is unable to produce reasonable evidence that the results of the audit are not accurate, then the cooperative shall pay to the town a penalty equal to five percent of the total amount underpaid in addition to the total amount underpaid. No penalty shall be assessed for uncollected franchise fees by cooperative; however, the cooperative shall provide evidence of the actual amount of uncollected franchise fees. Interest on the total amount of underpayment shall be paid at the interest rate in effect on the date the original payment was due (calculated as provided in section 9(D) hereof), plus two percent, and interest shall be calculated from the time the original amount was due. Any additional amount due to town hereunder shall be paid within 30 days from the date of invoice. Any amount not paid within 30 days from the date of the invoice will cause interest to be payable at the interest rate in effect on the date of the invoice (calculated as provided in section 9(D) hereof), plus two percent on the entire amount from the date of invoice. 
E.  The cooperative shall assist the town in its review by responding to all requests for information no later than 30 days after receipt of a request unless a different schedule is agreed to by the town and cooperative.  
Sec. 11. - Right of renegotiation. 
A.  Should either cooperative or the town have cause to believe that a change in circumstances relating to the terms of the franchise granted herein may exist, it may request that the other party provide it with a reasonable amount of information to assist in determining whether a change in circumstances has taken place. If the cooperative elects to participate in customer choice (i.e., retail competition), it shall notify the town within 30 days of the cooperative's election to so participate. 
B.  Should either party hereto determine that based on a change in circumstances, it is in such party's best interest to renegotiate all or some of the provisions of this ordinance, then the other party agrees to enter into good faith negotiations. Said negotiations shall involve reasonable, diligent, and timely discussions about the pertinent issues and a resolute attempt to settle those issues. The obligation to engage in such negotiations does not obligate either party to agree to an amendment of this ordinance as a result of such negotiations. A failure to agree does not show a lack of good faith. If, as a result of renegotiation, the town and cooperative agree to a change in a provision of this ordinance, the change shall become effective upon passage of an ordinance by the town in accordance with the town charter and acceptance of the ordinance by cooperative.  
Sec. 12. - Transfer and assignment. 
The franchise granted herein shall not be assigned or transferred without the written consent of the town, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided, however, that cooperative may assign its rights under this ordinance to a parent, subsidiary, affiliate or successor entity without such consent, so long as (i) such parent, subsidiary, affiliate or successor assumes all obligations of cooperative hereunder; and (ii) is bound to the same extent as cooperative hereunder. Cooperative shall give the town 60 days prior written notice of any assignment to a parent, subsidiary, affiliate or successor entity. Any required consent shall be expressed by an ordinance that fully recites the terms and conditions, if any, upon which such consent is given. Any assignment or transfer effected prior to the town's approval thereof, if required, shall authorize the town to treat such assignment or transfer as an uncured event of default and immediately implement the provisions of section 14, including the right to terminate the franchise granted herein.  
Sec. 13. - Term. 
This ordinance shall become effective on the effective date and shall expire on December 31, 2022; provided that, unless written notice of non-renewal is given by either party hereto to the other not less than six months before the expiration of the Franchise granted herein, it shall be automatically renewed for an additional period of one year from such expiration date and shall be automatically renewed thereafter for like periods until canceled by written notice given not less than six months before the expiration of any such renewal period.  
Sec. 14. - Default, remedies and termination. 
A.  Events of default. The occurrence, at any time during the term of the franchise granted herein, of any one or more of the following events, shall constitute an event of default by cooperative under this ordinance: 
1.  The failure of cooperative to pay the franchise fee on or before the due dates specified herein. 
2.  Cooperative's breach or violation of any terms, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein or cooperative's failure to perform any material obligation contained herein. 
B.  Uncured events of default. 
1.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default which can be cured by the immediate payment of money to town or a third party, cooperative shall have 30 calendar days after receipt of written notice from town of an occurrence of such event of default (or such longer time as the town may specify in such notice) to cure same before town may exercise any of its rights or remedies pursuant to section 14(C). 
2.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default by cooperative which cannot be cured by the immediate payment of money to town or a third party, cooperative shall have 60 calendar days (or such additional time as may be agreed to by the town) after receipt of written notice from town of an occurrence of such event of default to cure same before town may exercise any of its rights or remedies pursuant to section 14(C). 
3.  If the event of default is not cured within the time period allowed for curing the event of default as provided for herein, such event of default shall, without additional notice, become an uncured event of default, which shall entitle town to exercise the remedies pursuant to section 14(C). 
C.  Remedies. Upon receipt of a notice of an alleged uncured event of Default as described in section 14(B), which notice shall specify the alleged failure with reasonable particularity, the cooperative shall, within the time periods specified in section 14(B) or such longer period of time as the town may specify in such notice, either cure such alleged failure or, in a written response to the town, present facts and arguments in refuting or defending such alleged failure, or state that such alleged failure will be cured and set forth the method and time schedule for accomplishing such cure. In the event that such cure is not forthcoming or the town determines that an unexcused uncured event of default has occurred, town shall be entitled to exercise any and all of the following cumulative remedies: 
1.  The commencement of an action against cooperative at law for monetary damages. 
2.  The commencement of an action in equity seeking injunctive relief or the specific performance of any of the provisions, which as a matter of equity, are specifically enforceable. 
3.  The termination of the franchise granted herein. 
D.  Remedies not exclusive. The rights and remedies of town and cooperative set forth in this ordinance shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity. Town and cooperative understand and intend that such remedies shall be cumulative to the maximum extent permitted by law and the exercise by town of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the exercise by town, at the same or different times, of any other such remedies for the same failure to cure. However, notwithstanding this section or any other provision of this ordinance, Town shall not recover both liquidated damages and actual damages for the same violation, breach, or noncompliance, either under this section or under any other provision of this ordinance. 
E.  Termination. The franchise granted herein may be terminated only in accordance with the provisions of section 14(C). Town shall notify cooperative in writing at least 30 business days in advance of the town council meeting at which the questions of termination shall be considered, and cooperative shall have the right to appear before the town council in person or by counsel and raise any objections or defenses cooperative may have that are relevant to the proposed forfeiture or termination. The final decision of the town council may be appealed to any court or regulatory authority having jurisdiction. Upon timely appeal by cooperative of the town council's decision terminating the franchise granted herein, the effective date of such termination shall be either when such appeal is withdrawn or a court order upholding the termination becomes final and unappealable. If no appeal is filed, the effective date of such termination shall be the 30th day following the date of the final termination decision of the town council. Until the termination becomes effective the provisions of the franchise granted herein shall remain in effect for all purposes. 
F.  The failure of the town to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this ordinance shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the town unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by the town.  
Sec. 15. - Public information. 
If the cooperative provides confidential or proprietary information to the town, the cooperative shall be solely responsible for identifying such information with markings calculated to bring the town's attention to the proprietary or confidential nature of the information, provided it is expressly understood and agreed that all maps and all information concerning franchise fee calculation and payments and audit information furnished by or on behalf of the cooperative to the town or its auditors or consultants shall be deemed strictly confidential and subject to the town's agreement in the next sentence. The town agrees to maintain the confidentiality of any information obtained from cooperative so designated to the fullest extent allowed by law. If the town is not permitted by applicable law to maintain such confidentiality, the town shall notify the cooperative of such fact at the time the town requests any such information from the cooperative or, in all other events, prior to receiving such information from the cooperative. Town shall not be liable to cooperative for the release of any information the town is required to release by law. Town shall provide notice to cooperative of any request for release of information designated as confidential or proprietary prior to releasing the information so as to allow cooperative adequate time to pursue available remedies for protection. If the town receives a request under the Texas Public Information Act that includes information designated by cooperative as proprietary or confidential, town will notify the Texas Attorney General of the asserted proprietary or confidential nature of the document(s). The town also will provide cooperative with a copy of such notification to the Texas Attorney General, and thereafter Cooperative is responsible for establishing that an exception under the Texas Public Information Act allows the town to withhold the information.  
Sec. 16. - Public purpose. 
All of the provisions contained in this ordinance are hereby declared to be for a public purpose, and are in the interests of the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.  
Sec. 17. - Severability; ordinance controlling. 
If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is for any reason held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, void or invalid (or for any reason unenforceable), the validity of the remaining portions of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby, it being the intent of the parties in adopting this ordinance that no provision hereof shall be inoperative or fail by reason of any unconstitutionality or invalidity of any other portion, provision, or regulation, and to that end, all provisions of this ordinance are declared to be severable. Both the cooperative and the town expressly recognize that this ordinance creates a binding and enforceable contract between them, which contract may not be amended without written consent of both the cooperative and the town. Should the town enact an ordinance or ordinances that create an inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this ordinance and such other ordinance or ordinances during the term of this franchise, then the provisions of this ordinance shall control to the extent of such inconsistency or conflict to the extent not prohibited by law.  
Sec. 18. - Notice. 
Any notices required or desired to be given from one party to the other party to this ordinance shall be in writing and shall be given and shall be deemed to have been served and received if: (i) delivered in person to the address set forth below; (ii) deposited in an official depository under the regular care and custody of the United States Postal Service located within the confines of the United States of America and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and addressed to such party at the address hereinafter specified; or (iii) delivered to such party by courier receipted delivery. Either party may designate another address within the confines of the continental United States of America for notice, but until written notice of such change is deemed served and received by the other party as provided above, the last address of such party designated for notice shall remain such party's address for notice.

Section 1. - Grant of Authority. 
A.  The Town of Flower Mound, Texas ("Town") hereby grants to Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC, its successors and assigns (herein called "Company"), the right, privilege and franchise to construct, extend, maintain and operate in, along, under and across the present and future streets, alleys, highways, public utility easements, public ways, and other public property ("Public Rights-of-Way") of Flower Mound, electric power lines, with all necessary or desirable appurtenances (including underground conduits, poles, towers, wires, transmission lines and other structures, and telephone and communication lines solely for Company's own use), for the purpose of delivering electricity to the Town, the inhabitants thereof, and persons, firms and corporations beyond the corporate limits thereof, for the term set out in Section 10, subject to this consent by the Town in accordance with Texas Utilities Code, Section 181.043 and in accordance with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) and all other applicable laws, rules, and regulations. 
B.  The provisions set forth in this ordinance represent the terms and conditions under which Company shall construct, operate, and maintain its system facilities within the Public Rights-of-Way of the Town. This franchise agreement shall in no way affect or impair the rights, obligations or remedies of the parties under PURA, other state, local, or federal laws, rules or regulations, or the Texas Constitution. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party's right to contest, appeal, or file suit with respect to any action or decision of the other party, including ordinances adopted by the Town, that Company believes is in violation of any federal, state, or local laws, rules or regulations. The Town shall provide Company notice and opportunity to review and comment upon proposed ordinances relating to the Public Rights-of-Way. 
C.  This Franchise does not grant to the Company the right, privilege or authority to engage in any other activities within the Town other than as specified in this Franchise.  
Section 2. - Use of Public Rights-of-Way. 
A.  The poles, towers and other structures shall be so erected as not to unreasonably interfere with traffic over streets, alleys and highways. 
B.  Company shall, except in cases of (i) emergency conditions or (ii) routine maintenance and repair of facilities that do not involve any of the following (a) cutting or breaking of pavement or (b) closure of traffic lane for longer than 24 hours or (c) boring or (d) excavation greater than 100 cubic feet or (iii) connection of real property to a utility service on the same side of the Public Rights-of-Way if connection does not require a pavement cut in the Public Rights-of-Way or (iv) replacement of a single damaged pole and associated work within a ten (10) foot radius of the damaged pole or (v) installation of aerial lines on less than 11 existing poles or installation of aerial lines on less than 11 new poles, provide Town reasonable advance notice, and obtain a permit, (if required by Town Ordinance), prior to performing work in the Public Rights-of-Way, except in no instance shall Company be required to pay fees or bonds related to its use of the Public Rights-of-Way, despite the Town's enactment of any ordinance providing the contrary. Company shall construct and maintain its facilities in conformance with the applicable provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code or such comparable standards as may be adopted, and in a good and workmanlike manner. 
C.  The Town retains the right to make visual, non-invasive inspections of the Company's facilities and upon reasonable notice and request, to require the Company to make available for inspection available records or data to demonstrate its current compliance with the terms of this Franchise. 
D.  The location of Company's facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way shall be subject to approval by the Town Manager or the Town Manger's designated representative (the "Manager") prior to construction; provided however, said approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. This approval will be obtained through the Town's permitting process (if required by Town Ordinance). In the event of a conflict between the location of the proposed facilities of Company and the locations of the facilities of Town or other Public Rights-of-Way users which exist or have been authorized by the Town, the Manager shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective facilities within the Town's Public Rights-of-Way. To avoid a facilities location conflict, the Manager will designate a reasonable alternate location within the Town's Public Rights-of-Way for Company's facilities if a reasonable alternate location exists. The Company will use reasonable efforts to work with the Town to avoid installing its facilities in park or Town property other than utility easements or street, alley, or highway Right-of-Way. Company has the right to request Town Council review of this or any actions concerning Company's use of the Public Rights-of-Way. Company also has the right to request review of any Town action by any court or regulatory agency having jurisdiction. 
E.  The Company shall restore at the Company's expense, all work within the Town Rights-of-Way, to a condition equally as good as it was immediately prior to being disturbed by Company's construction, excavation, repair or removal or to a condition agreed upon by Town and Company. If Town or Company believe that there are extenuating circumstances that do not allow for restoration of all work within the Town Rights-of-Way to a condition equally as good as it was immediately prior to being disturbed by Company, Town and Company will negotiate an alternative restoration plan (in writing) to remedy the situation. Absent an agreement to an alternative restoration plan, either party has a right to request review of the matter by any court or regulatory agency having jurisdiction. 
F.  Company shall cooperate with the Town in providing information regarding the location of current and future overhead and underground wires and poles within Town's Public Rights-of-Way. Reproducible copies of maps showing the location of all overhead and underground wires and poles within the Public Rights-of-Way shall be furnished to the Town upon reasonable request, if available. The maps shall be provided in electronic digital format, if available.  
Section 3. - Relocation and Abandonment. 
The Town reserves the right to lay, and permit to be laid, storm, sewer, gas, water, wastewater and other pipe lines, cables, and conduits, or other improvements or to do and permit to be done any underground or overhead work that Town in its sole discretion determines may be necessary or proper in, across, along, over, or under Public Rights-of-Way occupied by Company. The Town also reserves the right to change in any manner any curb, sidewalk, highway, alley, public way, street, utility lines, storm sewers, drainage basins, drainage ditches, and the like. 
Upon request by Town, Company shall relocate its facilities at the expense of the Town except as otherwise required by Section 37.101(c) of PURA, which statutory provision currently states the governing body of a municipality may require an electric utility to relocate the utility's facility at the utility's expense to permit the widening or straightening of a street. Town and Company further agree that widening and straightening of a street includes the addition of any acceleration, deceleration, center or side turn lanes, and sidewalks (meaning sidewalks done in conjunction with widening or straightening of a street), provided that the Town shall provide Company with at least thirty (30) days notice and shall specify a new location for such facilities along the Public Rights-of-Way of the street. 
If the Town requires the Company to adapt or conform its Facilities, or in any manner to alter, relocate, or change its Facilities to enable any other corporation or person to use, or use with greater convenience, said street, alley, highway, or public way, the Company shall not be bound to make such changes until such other corporation or person shall have undertaken, with good and sufficient bond, to reimburse the Company for any costs, loss, or expense which will be caused by, or arises out of such change, alteration, or relocation of Company's Facilities. 
If Town abandons any Public Rights-of-Way in which Company has facilities such abandonment shall be conditioned on Company's right to maintain its use of the former Public Rights-of-Way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public Rights-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Company for all removal or relocation expenses if Company agrees to the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Rights-of-Way. If the party to whom the Public Rights-of-Way is abandoned requests the Company to remove or relocate its facilities and Company agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another Public Rights-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation.  
Section 4. - Indemnification. 
A.  In consideration of the granting of this Franchise, Company shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold the Town, and its past and present officers, agents and employees harmless against any and all liability arising from suits, actions or claims regarding injury or death to any person or persons, or damages to any property arising out of, or occasioned by the intentional and/or negligent acts or omissions of the Company or any of its officers, agents, or employees, in connection with Company's construction, maintenance and operation of Company's System in the Public Rights-of-Way, including any court costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable defenses thereof. 
B.  This indemnity shall only apply to the extent that the loss, damage or injury is attributable to the negligence or wrongful act or omission of the Company, its officers, agents or employees, and does not apply to the extent such loss, damage or injury is attributable to the negligence or wrongful act or omission of the Town, or the Town's officers, agents, or employees or any other person or entity. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the Company and the Town. 
C.  In the event of joint and concurrent negligence or fault of both the Company and the Town, responsibility and indemnity, if any, shall be apportioned comparatively between the Town and Company in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the Town under Texas law and without waiving any of the defenses of the parties under Texas law. Further, in the event of joint and concurrent negligence or fault of both the Company and the Town, responsibility for all costs of defense shall be apportioned between the Town and Company based upon the comparative fault of each. 
D.  In fulfilling its obligation to defend and indemnify Town, Company shall have the right to select defense counsel, subject to Town's approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Company shall retain defense counsel within seven (7) business days of Town's written notice that Town is invoking its right to indemnification under this Franchise. If Company fails to retain Counsel within such time period, Town shall have the right to retain defense counsel on its own behalf, and Company shall be liable for all reasonable defense costs incurred by Town, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.B and 4.C.

Section 6. - Non-Exclusivity. 
This franchise is not exclusive, and nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to prevent the Town from granting other like or similar rights, privileges and franchises to any other person, firm, or corporation.  
Section 7. - Consideration. 
In consideration of the grant of said right, privilege and franchise by the Town and as full payment for the right, privilege and franchise of using and occupying the said Public Rights-of-Way, and in lieu of any and all occupation taxes, assessments, municipal charges, fees, easement taxes, franchise taxes, license, permit and inspection fees or charges, street taxes, bonds, street or alley rentals, and all other taxes, charges, levies, fees and rentals of whatsoever kind and character which the Town may impose or hereafter be authorized or empowered to levy and collect, excepting only the usual general or special ad valorem taxes which the Town is authorized to levy and impose upon real and personal property, sales and use taxes, and special assessments for public improvements, Company shall pay to the Town the following: 
A.  A final quarterly payment was made on or before January 1, 2016 for the basis period of August 1, 2015 through October 31, 2015 and the privilege period of October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 in accordance with the provisions in the previous franchise. 
B.  As authorized by Section 33.008(b) of PURA, the original franchise fee factor calculated for the Town in 2002 was 0.003031 (the "Base Factor"), multiplied by each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered by Company to each retail customer whose consuming facility's point of delivery is located within the Town's municipal boundaries for determining franchise payments going forward. 
Due to a 2006 agreement between Company and Town the franchise fee factor was increased to a franchise fee factor of 0.003183 (the "Current Factor"), multiplied by each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered by Company to each retail customer whose consuming facility's point of delivery is located within the Town's municipal boundaries on a quarterly basis. 
However, consistent with the 2006 agreement, should the Public Utility Commission of Texas at any time disallow Company's recovery through rates of the higher franchise payments made under the Current Factor as compared to the Base Factor, then the franchise fee factor shall immediately revert to the Base Factor of 0.003031 and all future payments, irrespective of the time period that is covered by the payment, will be made using the Base Factor. 
1.  Company shall make quarterly pre-pay payments as follows:

January 1 	Aug. 1Oct. 31 	Oct. 1Dec. 31 
 
2.

If this Franchise is not effective prior to the first quarterly payment date, Company will pay any payments due within 30 days of the effective date of this agreement. The final payment under this Franchise is due on or before January 1, 2036 and covers the basis period of August 1, 2035 through October 31, 2035 and the privilege period of October 1, 2036 through December 31, 2036. 
3.  After the final payment date of January 1, 2036, Company may continue to make additional quarterly payments in accordance with the above schedule. Town acknowledges that such continued payments will correspond to privilege periods that extend beyond the term of this Franchise and that such continued payments will be recognized in any subsequent franchise as full payment for the relevant quarterly periods. 
C.  A sum equal to four percent (4%) of gross revenues received by Company from services identified as DD1 through DD24 in Section 6.1.2 "Discretionary Service Charges," in Oncor's Tariff for Retail Delivery Service (Tariff), effective 1/1/2002, that are for the account and benefit of an end-use retail electric consumer. Company will, upon request by Town, provide a cross reference to Discretionary Service Charge numbering changes that are contained in Company's current approved Tariff. 
1.  The franchise fee amounts based on "Discretionary Service Charges" shall be calculated on an annual calendar year basis, i.e., from January 1 through December 31 of each calendar year. 
2.  The franchise fee amounts that are due based on "Discretionary Service Charges" shall be paid at least once annually on or before April 30 each year based on the total "Discretionary Service Charges", as set out in Section 7.C, received during the preceding calendar year. The initial Discretionary Service Charge franchise fee amount will be paid on or before April, 30 2016 and will be based on the calendar year January 1 through December 31, 2015. The final Discretionary Service Charge franchise fee amount will be paid on or before April 30, 2037 and will be based on the calendar year of January 1 through December 31, 2036. 
3.  Company may file a tariff or tariff amendment(s) to provide for the recovery of the franchise fee on Discretionary Service Charges. 
4.  Town agrees (i) to the extent the Town acts as regulatory authority, to adopt and approve that portion of any tariff which provides for 100% recovery of the franchise fee on Discretionary Service Charges; (ii) in the event the Town intervenes in any regulatory proceeding before a federal or state agency in which the recovery of the franchise fees on such Discretionary Service Charges is an issue, the Town will take an affirmative position supporting the 100% recovery of such franchise fees by Company and; (iii) in the event of an appeal of any such regulatory proceeding in which the Town has intervened, the Town will take an affirmative position in any such appeals in support of the 100% recovery of such franchise fees by Company. 
5.  Town agrees that it will take no action, nor cause any other person or entity to take any action, to prohibit the recovery of such franchise fees by Company. 
6.  In the event of a regulatory disallowance of the recovery of the franchise fees on the Discretionary Service Charges, Company will not be required to continue payment of such franchise fees. 
D.  With each payment of compensation required by Section 7.B, Company shall furnish to Town a statement that provides the franchise basis period, the total amount of kilowatt hours of electricity delivered during the franchise basis period by the Company to retail customers whose consuming facility's point of delivery is located within the Town's municipal boundaries, and the privilege period covered by the payment. The parties agree that any information exchanged or provided to the other party is true and correct to the best of their knowledge. 
E.  With each payment of compensation required by Section 7.C, Company shall furnish to the Town a statement reflecting the total amount of gross revenues received by Company within the Town's municipal boundaries for services identified in its Tariff, Section 6.1.2, "Discretionary Service Charges," Items DD1 through DD24. The parties agree that any information exchanged or provided to the other party is true and correct to the best of their knowledge.  
Section 8. - Most Favored Nations. 
A.  This Section 8 applies only if, after the effective date of this Franchise Agreement, Company enters into a new municipal franchise agreement or renews an existing municipal franchise agreement with another municipality that provides for a different method of calculation of franchise fees for use of the Public Rights-of-Way than the calculation under PURA, Section 33.008(b), which, if applied to the Town, would result in a greater amount of franchise fees owed the Town than under this Franchise Agreement. 
B.  In the event of an occurrence as described in Section 8 hereof, Town shall have the option to: 
1.  Have Company select, within 30 days of the Town's request, any or all portions of the franchise agreement with the other municipality or comparable provisions that, at Company's sole discretion, must be considered in conjunction with the different method of the calculation of franchise fees included in that other franchise agreement; and 
2.  Modify this franchise agreement to include both the different method of calculation of franchise fee found in the franchise agreement with the other municipality and all of the other provisions identified by Company pursuant to Section 8.B.1. In no event shall Town be able to modify the franchise to include the different method of calculation of franchise fee found in the franchise agreement with the other municipality without this franchise also being modified to include all of the other provisions identified by Company pursuant to Section 8.B.1. 
C.  Town may not exercise the option provided in Section 8 if any of the provisions that would be included in this franchise are, in Company's sole opinion, inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to any then-current rule, regulation, ordinance, law, Code, or Town Charter. 
D.  In the event of a regulatory disallowance of the increase in franchise fees paid pursuant to Town's exercise of its option under Section 8, then at any time after the regulatory authority's entry of an order disallowing recovery of the additional franchise fee expense in rates, Company shall have the right to cancel the modification of the franchise made pursuant to Section 8, and the terms of the Franchise shall immediately revert to those in place prior to Town's exercise of its option under Section 8. 
E.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this franchise, should the Town exercise the option provided in Section 8.B, and then adopt any rule, regulation, ordinance, law, Code, or Town Charter that, in Company's sole opinion, is inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to the provisions included in this franchise pursuant to Section 8.B, then Company shall have the right to cancel all of the modifications to this franchise made pursuant to Section 8 and, effective as of the date of the Town's adoption of the inconsistent provision, the terms of the franchise shall revert to those in place prior to the Town's exercise of its option under Section 8. 
F.  The provisions of Section 8 apply only to the amount of the franchise fee to be paid and do not apply to other franchise fee payment provisions, such as the timing of such payments. The provisions of Section 8 do not apply to differences in the franchise fee factor that result from the application of the methodology set out in Section 33.008(b) of PURA or a successor methodology.  
Section 9. - Records and Reports. 
A.  Company shall keep accurate books of account at its principal office for the purpose of determining the amount due to the Town under this Franchise. 
B.  Pursuant to Section 33.008(e) of the Texas Utilities Code, the Town may conduct an audit or other inquiry in relation to a payment made by Company less than two (2) years before the commencement of such audit or inquiry. The Town may, if it sees fit, and upon reasonable notice to the Company, have the books and records of the Company examined by a representative of the Town to ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein. 
C.  The Company shall make available to the auditor during the Company's regular business hours and upon reasonable notice, such personnel and records as the Town may, in its reasonable discretion, request in order to complete such audit, and shall make no charge to the Town therefore. 
1.  If as the result of any Town audit, Company is refunded/credited for an overpayment, or pays the Town for an underpayment, of the Franchise Fee, such refund/credit or payment shall be made pursuant to the payment terms established in Section 7. 
D.  The Company shall assist the Town in its review by responding to all requests for information no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of a request. 
E.  The Town agrees to maintain the confidentiality of any non-public information obtained from Company to the extent allowed by law if Company identifies the information as non-public prior to providing the information to Town. Town shall not be liable to Company for the release of any information the Town is required by law to release. Town shall provide notice to Company of any request for release of non-public information prior to releasing the information so as to allow Company adequate time to pursue available remedies for protection. If the Town receives a request under the Texas Public Information Act that includes information Company has identified as Company's proprietary information, Town will notify the Texas Attorney General of the proprietary nature of the document(s). The Town also will provide Company with a copy of this notification, and thereafter Company is responsible for establishing that an exception under the Act allows the Town to withhold the information. 
F.  If either party discovers that the Company has either overpaid the Town or failed to pay the entire or correct amount of compensation due the Town, the correct amount shall be mutually determined by the Town and Company and shall be paid by the responsible party within thirty (30) calendar days of such mutual determination. Such underpayments or overpayments shall include interest calculated in accordance with the interest rate for customer deposits established by the PUC in accordance with Texas Utilities Code Section 183.003. Any overpayment to the Town by Company through error or otherwise, will, at the option of the Town, either be refunded within thirty (30) days of the mutual determination or be offset against the next payment due from Company. If neither party can mutually agree on either the underpayment due the Town or an overpayment due the Company, both the Town and Company may seek any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity. Acceptance by the Town or Company of any payment due under this Section shall not be deemed to be a waiver by the Town or Company of any breach of this Franchise, nor shall the acceptance by the Town or Company of any such payments preclude the Town or Company from later establishing that a larger amount was actually due or from collecting any balance due.  
Section 10. - Term. 
This Ordinance shall become effective upon Company's written acceptance hereof, said written acceptance to be filed by Company with the Town Secretary within sixty (60) days after final passage and approval by the Town hereof but not prior to thirty (30) days after passage by Town. The right, privilege and franchise granted hereby shall expire on December 31, 2036 provided that, unless written notice of cancelation is given by either party hereto to the other not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of this franchise agreement, it shall be automatically renewed for an additional period of six (6) months from such expiration date and shall be automatically renewed thereafter for like periods until canceled by written notice given not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of any such renewal period.  
Section 11. - Repealer Clause. 
This Ordinance shall supersede any and all other franchises granted by the Town to Company, its predecessors and assigns, provided the parties agree any claim, action or complaint by either party that arose under or pursuant to any such previous franchise ordinance shall be preserved and saved from repeal, subject to all applicable statutes of limitations.  
Section 12. - Default, Remedies, Termination. 
A.  Events of Default. The occurrence, at any time during the term of the Franchise Agreement, of any one or more of the following events, shall constitute an Event of Default by Company under this Franchise: 
1.  The failure of Company to pay the franchise fee on or before the due dates specified herein. 
2.  Company's material breach or material violation of any material terms, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein. 
B.  Uncured Events of Default. 
1.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which can be cured by the immediate payment of money to Town, Company shall have thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of written notice from Town of an occurrence of such Event of Default to cure same before Town may exercise any of its rights or remedies provided for in Section 12.C. 
2.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by Company which cannot be cured by the immediate payment of money to Town, Company shall have sixty (60) calendar days (or such additional time as may be agreed to by the Town) from receipt of written notice from Town of an occurrence of such Event of Default to cure same before Town may exercise any of its rights or remedies provided for in Section 12.C. 
3.  If the Event of Default is not cured within the time period allowed for curing the Event of Default as provided for herein, such Event of Default shall, without additional notice, become an Uncured Event of Default, which shall entitle Town to exercise the remedies provided for in Section 12.C. 
C.  Remedies. The Town shall notify the Company in writing of an alleged Uncured Event of Default as described in Section 12.B, which notice shall specify the alleged failure with reasonable particularity. The Company shall, within thirty (30) business days after receipt of such notice or such longer period of time as the Town may specify in such notice, either cure such alleged failure or in a written response to the Town either present facts and arguments in refuting or defending such alleged failure or state that such alleged failure will be cured and set forth the method and time schedule for accomplishing such cure. In the event that such cure is not forthcoming, Town shall be entitled to exercise any and all of the following cumulative remedies: 
1.  The commencement of an action against Company at law for monetary damages. 
2.  The commencement of an action in equity seeking injunctive relief or the specific performance of any of the provisions that as a matter of equity, are specifically enforceable. 
3.  The termination of this Franchise. 
D.  The rights and remedies of Town and Company set forth in this Franchise Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity. Town and Company understand and intend that such remedies shall be cumulative to the maximum extent permitted by law and the exercise by Town of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the exercise by Town, at the same or different times, of any other such remedies for the same failure to cure. However, notwithstanding this Section or any other provision of this Franchise, Town shall not recover both liquidated damages and actual damages for the same violation, breach, or noncompliance, either under this Section or under any other provision of this Franchise. 
E.  Termination. In accordance with the provisions of Section 12.C, this Franchise may be terminated upon thirty (30) business day's prior written notice to Company. Town shall notify Company in writing at least fifteen (15) business days in advance of the Town Council meeting at which the question of forfeiture or termination shall be considered, and Company shall have the right to appear before the Town Council in person or by counsel and raise any objections or defenses Company may have that are relevant to the proposed forfeiture or termination. The final decision of the Town Council may be appealed to any court or regulatory authority having jurisdiction. Upon timely appeal by Company of the Town Council's decision terminating the Franchise, the effective date of such termination shall be either when such appeal is withdrawn or an order upholding the termination becomes final and unappealable. Until the termination becomes effective the provisions of this Franchise shall remain in effect for all purposes.
