In 2019, codification and administration of the City Code began in-­house under the direction of the City Recorder and with the assistance of Municipal Code Corporation. This Municipal Code shall be cited as the Providence City Code or “PCC” as an acronym.

This City Code maintains a structure by subject matter using a hyphenated numbering system identifying the Title, Chapter, and section (for example: 1-1-1).

The first number in the sequence (1-1-1) designates the Title level, as written in the table of contents
The second series of numbers (1-1-1) designates the Chapter level, as written in the table of contents
The last series (1-1-1) designates the section level, and is expressed using three numerical values
This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching the City Code and to assist in subsequent codification as new ordinances are added to PCC.

The legislation herein may be arranged as an alphanumeric ordered list A, 1, a, (1), (A), (a) to show hierarchal relationships. The legislation may also be arranged as an unordered list (using bullets, discs, squares, etc.) to show items without hierarchal relationships. These list structures assist in subsequent codification as new legislation is added.

Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed for future use and may be marked “Reserved” to ease internal expansion. The legislative history identifies the specific legal sources of a section as may be provided in footnotes.

This City Code is supplemented from time to ­time with amendments and additions made by Providence, Utah. The specific legal sources that comprise this City Code have been adapted during the codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies between the online Municipal Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal Code Corporation provides a searchable database of the City Code for easy reference and convenience.

NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CITY CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE CITY CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT THE CITY RECORDER.

1-9A-1 General
Administrative remedies are intended as actions that may be applied to help ensure compliance with City ordinances, resolutions, regulations or any other City, state or federal requirements at a lower or administrative level to avoid costly or perhaps unneeded legal action.

Unless otherwise specifically provided for in any ordinance, resolution or other regulations of the City or any code adopted by reference, the City Council, Mayor or an Officer of the City may seek administrative remedies, in accordance with this Chapter, to ensure compliance with any ordinance, resolution, or regulations of the City, or any other City, state or federal requirement, by any person, business or other legal entity.
Similarly, any person, business, or other legal entity may seek administrative remedies from the City, also in accordance with this Chapter.
For the purposes of this Chapter, an officer of the City is defined to be any of the following: Mayor, City Manager, City Administrator, City Recorder, City Treasurer, City Engineer, Public Works Director, Building Official, Building Compliance & Permit Clerk.
1-9A-2 Application Of Administrative Remedies
Unless otherwise specifically provided in any ordinance or resolution of the City, the City may, upon notice to a person, business or other legal entity, apply any of the following administrative remedies to such person, business, or other legal entity if he/she/it is found to be in default on any matter relating to or business dealing with the City, or has otherwise failed to fulfill an obligation or commitment to the City, as listed in paragraph B. below.

Administrative Remedies: the following may be applied by the City:
Refuse to accept or inspect, deny, withhold, or otherwise stop the processing of any permit, license, certificate, approval, order, application, or any similar authorization or contract normally issued by the municipality to such person, business or other legal entity.
Direct a stop work order for any construction in progress by such person, business or other legal entity involved.
Decline to award any contract or otherwise do business of any nature with such person, business or other legal entity.
Default: A person, business, or other legal entity may be considered in default with the City for any of the following:
Delinquency in the payment of a utility bill or any other money owed to the City.
Non-performance of required construction of repairs on original infrastructure improvements or on guaranteed infrastructure improvements that have been dedicated or are to be dedicated to the City in accordance with agreed upon development plans.
Constructing, occupying or otherwise using or allowing to be used, a facility, home, dwelling or other structure or development in a manner contrary to agreed upon development plans, approved final plats, or the City’s land use and/or other applicable resolutions, regulations or ordinances. This shall include failure to comply with any applicable state and federal laws or regulations.
Failure to properly license and keep current any business license, home occupation license, home business license, or other license required in accordance with the City Code.
Failure to comply with and fulfill all obligations related to an existing project, business, development or enterprise within the City, at the time any new application or request for any type of license, permit or approval is sought from the City.
Failure to maintain any City, state or federal license, professional or otherwise, required of a person, business or other legal entity to conduct any business or activity, whether existing or proposed.
The foregoing statement of defaults is not intended to be exclusive, but rather is intended to include and not be limited to the defaults listed above; it being the intention of the City to require all persons, business or other legal entities to be in compliance with all applicable City, state and federal ordinances, laws, resolutions and other regulations at the time he/she/it may apply for or request, initial or subsequent, permits, licenses, certificates, approvals, orders or similar authorizations from the City. Any officer of the City, as defined above, is granted authority to determine whether or not any administrative remedy should apply, which one to apply and to apply it, subject to the following provisions of this Chapter.
Procedure: Following a determination by the governing body or a City officer that a person, business, or other legal entity is in default with the City, the City Manager, City Administrator or City Recorder shall notify the party in default by giving notice to such person, business or other legal entity which shall include the following:
That the City has determined the party to be in default and the reason(s) for such a finding,
The administrative remedies which have been or may be applied,
What action(s) the party must do to no longer be considered in default and thereby have resolved any applied administrative remedies, and
The party’s rights to administrative remedies under this Chapter. 
Following such notice, the City shall indicate on any applicable permit, license, application, or contract a notice of the default position of the party involved and the required resolution of any such default position before any further action will be taken by the City on behalf of such person, business or other legal entity.

Applying administrative remedies by the City shall not be construed to mean that the City will not or can not pursue other legal remedies including civil or criminal action, all remedies being alternative in nature.
The City may require reimbursement by the party(s) involved for any costs and fees incurred by the City in applying administrative remedies under this Chapter when those costs and fees are above and beyond the normal or customary costs and fees of processing and pursuing the actions involved. Costs and fees that could be charged and collected may include but are not limited to: legal fees, administration costs, the costs of additional building inspections, collection costs, and the costs and fees incurred for any other work done, services performed and materials purchased by City employees or those hired by the City to repair, complete or correct infrastructure work, or to remedy any other default(s).

1-10-1 Scope; Applicability
Purpose: The purpose of the Government Records Access and Management Act (U.C.A. ' 63-2-101 et seq.) is to standardize both records access and management.
Intent: The intent of the Act is to make available to the public all of the records of government possible while protecting the privacy rights of individuals.
Records Availability: Most records of the City will be public and available at reasonable times and places for inspection and copying.
Criminal Sanctions: There are possible criminal sanctions for an individual who wrongly refuses access to a record and for an individual who wrongly discloses a properly classified record.

(Res. 96-003, 2-13-1996; 1998 Code) 

1-10-3 Classification Of Records
The words “designation” and “classification” are jargon which refers to the act of placing individual records or records series in one of four (4) classifications: public, private, controlled, or protected. Private, controlled and protected are terms of art which refer to specific classification possibilities. Most records must be public. Some records must be classified as private. These include records about a person’s welfare benefits, medical benefits, library records, employee’s home address, social security number and marital status. This list is not dispositive. Before any record is disclosed, the Records Officer should be consulted to ensure that privacy rights are maintained.

Information Required: A person making a request for a record must furnish the City with a written request containing his name, mailing address, daytime telephone number, if available, and a description of the records request that identifies the record with reasonable specificity.
Public Benefit: Any person who requests a record to obtain information for a story or report for publication or broadcast to the general public is presumed to be acting to benefit the public rather than a person.
(Res. 96-003, 2-13-1996; 1998 Code) 

1-10-6 Response By City
Time Limitations: As soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ten (10) business days after receiving a written request, or five (5) business days after receiving a written request if the requester demonstrates that expedited response to the record request benefits the public rather than the person, the City shall respond to the request by:
Approving the request and providing the record;
Denying the request;
Notifying the requester that it does not maintain the record and providing, if known, the name and address of the governmental entity that does maintain the record; or
Notifying the requester that because of one of the extraordinary circumstances  allowed by law (U.C.A. 63-2-204), it cannot immediately approve or deny the request.
Failure to Provide; Denial: If the City fails to provide the requested records or issues a denial within the specified time period, that failure is considered the equivalent of a determination denying access to the records.
(Res. 96-003, 2-13-1996; 1998 Code) 

1-10-7 Appeal
The law contains an appeals process (U.C.A. 63-2-401) for those wishing to either appeal a classification decision or an access decision.

3-8-1 Purpose
Residents of the City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The City has a substantial interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The City also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity. 
There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the City and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this Chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of City officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding Door-to-Door Solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by Door-to-Door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in Door-to-Door Solicitation, the City adopts this Chapter to promote the City’s substantial interests in: 
respecting citizen’s decisions regarding privacy in their residences; 
protecting persons from criminal conduct; 
providing equal opportunity to Advocate for and against Religious Belief, Political Position, or Charitable Activities; and
permitting truthful and non-misleading Door-to-Door Solicitation regarding lawful Goods or Services in intrastate or interstate commerce. 
The City finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this Chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the City interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated.

3-8-2 No Other City License Or Approval Required
Registered Solicitors and persons exempt from Registration need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or registration from the City to engage in Door-to-Door Solicitation.
Any Business licensed by the City under another City Ordinance that uses employees, independent contractors, or agents for Door-to-Door Solicitation in an effort to provide any tangible or intangible benefit to the Business, shall be required to have such Solicitors obtain a Certificate, unless otherwise exempt from Registration. 
Those Responsible Persons or Entities associated with Registered Solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or registration from the City, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed place of business in the City.
Nothing herein is intended to interfere with or supplant any other requirement of federal, state, or other local government law regarding any license, permit, or certificate that a Registered Solicitor is otherwise required to have or maintain.

For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

Payment of Delinquent Charges: If the water service is thereafter discontinued for failure to make payment, then before the water service to the premises shall again be provided, all delinquent water charges must have been paid to the City Treasurer or arrangements made for their payment in a manner satisfactory to the City. In the event water is turned off for nonpayment of water charges, then before the water service to the premises shall again be provided, the customer shall pay, in addition to all delinquent water charges, such extra charge for turning the water on and off as the City Council may have established by resolution. Until such resolution has been adopted, there shall be added an extra charge of twenty five dollars ($25.00) for turning on the water. Furthermore, in addition to such payments and penalties, a delinquent customer may be required to make and file a new application and deposit if the previous deposit has theretofore been applied to the payment of delinquent bills.

Abandoned Property: If the City determines the property has been abandoned and the account is delinquent, the City may begin small claims action.
Billing Disputes: If any person has a dispute over the correctness of a bill, he should call or visit the Utility Billing Clerk. If the dispute is over the number of gallons of water used during a summer month, the City will do the following:
If the reading seems extreme based on previous year’s billings, a Public Works employee will check the meter reading for accuracy;
If the reading is correct, the employee will check for leaks. If there is a leak between the meter and the main line, it is the responsibility of the City to repair it. This leak does not show up on the customers meter or add to his bill. A leak in any other place is the responsibility of the homeowner, including the connection on the bottom of the setter on the homeowners side.
If the meter doesn’t appear to be leaking, the employee will test the meter to see that it is calibrating correctly,
If the reading is correct, there are no apparent leaks, and the meter is calibrating correctly, the reading will stand. If there has been an error in reading, an adjustment will be made to the resident’s next utility bill. If there is a leak on the homeowners side of the meter, and they have it repaired within 30 days of the day the leak is detected, the clerk will adjust the billing based on the following method:
The Clerk will check the previous two years billing of the same month that the leak is detected.
Based on these figures, the Clerk will assess what an average bill is for that month. If a person has not lived in the City for two years, the Clerk will use the readings of the previous owner at that address, or if it is a newly constructed home, the minimum charge will apply.
Any excess above the amount figured by the Clerk to be the average bill will be paid half by the resident and half by the City.
Unless there are special circumstances, a person’s bill will only be adjusted for the month when the leak occurred.
The test for meter calibration will be done once a year at no charge. If an additional request is made to have the meter checked, the person making the request will be billed for time and materials.

Foreclosure: If a home is about to be foreclosed on, it is the responsibility of the homeowner to inform the City Office that such action is about to take place. The homeowner shall also give the name of the bank or the most local phone number of a person who is familiar with the account. Any deposit being held by the City will be applied to the debt.
Vacancies: If a home becomes vacant, the owner or responsible party may request in writing that the services be disconnected.

Signature of Applicant or Authorized Representative

Acceptance of any dedication of water hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon final, non-appealable approval by the Utah Division of Water Rights.
Before final acceptance of a dedication, the water right must be subject to a final, non-appealable approval by the Utah Division of Water Rights allowing (I) diversion from one or more of the City’s sources, or from another source acceptable to the City in its sole discretion, and (II) municipal or irrigation use within the City’s service area.
Notwithstanding the foregoing (i.e., subsection D.2.a.vii.I), approval shall not be required for shares or rights acceptable to the City held under a properly organized and lawfully operating water company serving lands or property within the City’s service area, including the Spring Creek Water Company and the Providence Blacksmith Fork Irrigation Company.
Any developer seeking Division of Water Rights approval as contemplated hereunder shall, upon request of the CWA, yield to the City all power and authority to prosecute the filing, review, and approval process, which shall be filed in the City’s name. The developer shall be responsible to pay all of the fees, costs, and expenses associated with the filing, review, and approval process.
Within 20 business days after an application has received final non-appealable approvals from the Utah Division of Water Rights, the City shall notify the developer of the fact. The developer may then proceed to final dedication of the water rights or water shares.
For water rights, dedication shall be by a Water Right Deed of the form approved by the City, but which shall include a warranty of title and water title insurance at the expense of the developer.
For water shares of a water company, the dedication shall be by the transfer of the shares to city by issuance of a share certification by the water company showing the City as the owner of the shares dedicated.
If an application is denied by the Utah Division of Water Rights or by a court of competent jurisdiction, the City shall have no obligation to accept the water rights as satisfaction of the dedication requirement of this section.
Final dedication of the water right or water shares must be completed prior to the recording of the final plat on the land being developed, or prior to issuance of a building permit for nonsubdivision Developments.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the City shall be under no obligation to approve or to accept any dedication if the CWA determines that acceptance of the water rights or water shares being offered for dedication is not in the best interest of the City. Any appeal of the determination by the CWA not to accept the dedication particular water rights or water shares may be appealed to the City Council; or
Upon recommendation of the CWA, the City Council determines that the City has sufficient water rights or water shares to meet its reasonable future water requirements of the public within the service area of the city adopts a Resolution stating that, in lieu of dedication, the City will accept cash or other property equivalent in value to the market value of the water rights and/or shares the dedication of which would otherwise be required under subsection D.2.a. The value of the hypothetical water rights or shares shall be based upon the most recent information available of similar water sales as determined by the CWA;
Exceptions:
In lieu of providing actual water rights to the City, good-faith amendments to existing platted subdivisions that require only up to a total of two acre-feet or less of additional indoor water and/or only up to a total of eight acre-feet or less of additional outdoor water for full development, may, at the time each building permit is issued for each lot, pay any applicable indoor and outdoor water rights acquisition impact fees specified by the City Code.
Minor Subdivisions and small Planned Unit Developments which have a projected indoor and outdoor water usage of less than eight acre-feet may be exempt from the foregoing requirement to provide indoor and outdoor water, upon a finding and waiver by the CWA and the City Council.
The necessary finding shall include, without limitation, a finding that the development for which the exception is sought is in fact a Minor Subdivision or small Planned Unit Development, as those terms are defined by this Code, and is not simply a portion or phase of a larger development being presented as a Minor Subdivision or small Planned Unit Development for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Section.
If such a finding and waiver is granted, a water acquisition impact fee will be charged pursuant to the provisions of the City Code.
If the City’s authorized impact fees contain a component for the acquisition or dedication of new water rights, developers who pay such impact fees on properties developed or to be developed pursuant to this Section shall be (i) credited for the amount of that water acquisition component, or (ii) reimbursed from subsequent hookup fees paid by owners within such a development. The amount, receipt, or payment of the credit or reimbursement shall be set forth in a Development Agreement between the developer and the City.
CWA Approval of a subdivision shall be sufficient for any approved lot within that subdivision. Such approval, however, shall expire if a final plat for such subdivision is not approved with a one year period after the approval is given.
No Alteration of Other Requirements: Nothing in this Section shall alter or change any other requirement of the City Ordinances relating to any building lot, subdivision approval, or other land-use application, but shall be in addition to any such requirements. CWA approval of a plat does not vest any rights in a developer, owner, or applicant; such approval serves only as a preliminary indication that sufficient water pursuant to the requirements of the City appears to be available. It does not constitute a determination by the Land Use Authority that a concept plan, a preliminary plat, or a final plat complies with all the requirements relating to water infrastructure, sewer, ditches, or other items relating to water delivery, usage, quality, and safety.

8-2-1 Sewer Department
Creation: The Sewer Department is hereby created. It shall comprise all of the property, equipment and personnel necessary to the maintenance and operation of the City’s sewage collection and the disposal system. The Department shall administer the operation and maintenance of the City sewer system.
Duties: The Public Works Director of the Sewer Department shall manage and supervise the City’s sewer system under the direction of the City Council, which from time to time shall, by resolution or otherwise, prescribe his powers and duties and direct the manner and frequency with which he shall make reports to the Mayor and City Council relating to the sewer system.
(Ord.  88-1, 4-12-1989; 1998 Code)

8-2-2 Use Of System Mandatory
Restrictions: It shall be unlawful for the owner or other person having charge of or occupying any property, upon which a building used for human occupancy shall have been or is being constructed, and any part of the building is within two hundred feet (200’) of a public sewer then in existence and used in the City, to construct or permit to be constructed or to use, or to permit to be used, any privy vault, septic tank or cesspool connection with such building.
Notice: Whenever an accepted public sewer is available to receive connections therewith, the City Administrator shall cause appropriate notice to be served upon the owner, agent, or other person having charge of or occupying all property coming within scope of this Section, that said public sewer is ready to receive connections therewith and that all plumbing must be connected with such sewer.
Compliance: Each such owner or other person shall, within sixty (60) days after having been given notice by the City that an accepted public sewer is available within three hundred feet (300') of such property line and ready to receive connections, cause such building to be connected with said sewer, except that if such building shall not at the time such notice is given have therein any toilets, the owner or other person having charge thereof or occupying such building shall have a period of two (2) years within which to connect it with such public sewer, and it shall thereafter be unlawful for such owner or other person to have the plumbing in such building remain unconnected to the public sewer or to maintain or use or cause to permit or exist any privy vault, septic tank or cesspool to which said building is connected or which is used by the occupant thereof.
Services Discontinued: Whenever the owner, agent or other person having charge of or occupying any property coming within the scope of this Section has been properly notified to make connection with an available public sewer and has not made or caused to be made such connection, or when such connection has been made but the connection and/or service charges therefore have not been paid, any water service to such premises shall immediately be discontinued, as provided in this Chapter. Those to be excluded will be considered on an individual basis. (Ord. 88-1, 4-12-1989; 1998 Code)
Exceptions: Citizens do not have to connect their buildings to a sewer if:
Structure is not in [source protection] zone 1 or 2 ( Zone designations change with demands on the aquifer so a home in Zone 3 today may be in Zone 2 in five years. If that happens, the home must be hooked to the sewer system.) and
A sewer main line is not parallel to the property line or
Connecting would require an ejection pump for all floors of a structure or
An existing home was annexed to the city from Cache County over the owner’s objections.

The City may enter into an agreement with property owners who do not connect to the sewer within five years of this ordinance being enacted wherein the property owner will agree to connect to the sewer upon sale or transfer of the property. 

All other structures must connect to the sewer.
8-2-3 Application For Connection, Service
Connection: Any person other than a subdivider who must comply with the Subdivision Title (See Title 11 of this Code), who desires or is required to secure a new connection to the City sewer system, shall file with the Sewer Department for each such connection a written and signed connection application, which is on file in the office of the Sewer Department.
Service: Any person who desires or is required to secure sewer service when such service is available from the City sewer system, shall file with the Sewer Department a written application and agreement for the service, which is on file in the office of the Sewer Department.
Non-owner Applicants: Applications for sewer service made by the tenant of an owner must, in addition to the requirements in subsection B of this Section, be guaranteed by an agreement signed by the owner of the premises or his duly authorized agent in such form as is on file in the office of the Sewer Department.
(Ord. 88-1, 4-12-1989, 1998 Code)

8-2-4 Fees
Service Rates and Connection Fees: The rates, penalty fee for delinquency in payment, and connection fees for sewer services from the City sewer system shall be fixed from time to time by resolution or ordinance of the City Council. The City Council may from time to time enact rules for levying, billing, guaranteeing and collection charges for sewer services and all other rules necessary for the management and control of the sewer system.
Special Rates: The City Council may from time to time fix by agreement or resolution special rates and/or conditions upon such terms as they may deem proper for users of the sewer service discharging wastes of unusual characteristics or making use thereof under exceptional circumstances.
Complaints; Corrections: The City Council is hereby constituted a Board of Equalization of sewer rates to hear complaints and make corrections of any assessments or charges deemed to illegal, unequal, or unjust.
(Ord. 88-1, 4-12-1989)

8-2-5 User Charges
Purpose: The purpose of this Section shall be to generate sufficient revenue to pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the system in proportion to each user’s contribution to the total loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength (BOD and TSS), volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user’s contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class).
Determining Factors:
Annual Operation And Maintenance Costs:
Established: The City shall determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests, and a reasonable contingency fund.
Toxic Pollutants; Increased Costs: Each user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge of the City collection and trunk line or the Logan City treatment works shall pay for such increased costs.
User’s Contribution Percentage:
The City shall determine for each user or user class the average daily volume of wastewater discharged to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharges to the wastewater system to determine such user’s volume and contribution percentage.
The City shall determine for each nonresidential user or user class the average daily poundage of five (5) day twenty degree Celsius (20?C) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all five (5) day BOD discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user’s BOD contribution percentage.
The City shall determine for each nonresidential user or user class the average daily total suspended solids (TSS) poundage discharges to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all TSS discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user’s TSS contribution percentage and TSS contribution percentage for each user or user class shall be multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the total of the total volume flow, total five (5) day twenty degree Celsius (20?C) BOD and total TSS, respectively.
Average user flows and strength contribution for residential users has been determined to be eight thousand (8,000) to twelve thousand (12,000) gal/month, BOD of two hundred (200) mg/l, TSS of two hundred fifty (250) mg/l. In those cases where a user exceeds the average minimum flow, the volume of wastewater shall be based on the gallons of water used with said water usage being based on average wintertime flows.
Surcharge for Excessive and Regulated Users: Should it become necessary, the City will assess a surcharge rate for all “regulated users”, as defined in subsection 8-2-10A of this Chapter, and those which discharge wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average sufficient to cover the additional administrative and inspection costs associated with such users and for additional efforts required to treat such waste.
Wastewater Service Charge: Each nonresidential user’s wastewater treatment cost contributions as determined in subsections B2 and B3 of this Section shall be added together to determine such user’s annual wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user based on an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The City Council may classify industrial, commercial, and other nonresidential establishments as a residential user; provided, that the wastes from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user with respect to volume, total suspended solids and BOD. Each user’s wastewater treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the rate schedule available at the City Office.
Replacement Fund: A reserve fund called the Wastewater Facilities Replacement Fund is hereby established within the Wastewater Utility Fund for the purpose of providing sufficient funds to be expended for obtaining and installing equipment, accessories and appurtenances during the useful life (20 years) of the wastewater treatment facilities necessary to maintain the capacity and performance for which such facilities are designed and constructed.
Review of Costs and Contribution:
Required: The City shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as well as each user’s wastewater contribution percentage not less often than every two (2) years and will revise the system necessary to assure equity of the service charge system established herein and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. The City shall apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year and adjust the rate accordingly. If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user’s wastewater contribution percentage, the user can present, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council, such factual information and the City shall then determine if the user’s wastewater contribution percentage is to be changed. The City shall notify the user of its findings as soon as possible.
Notification: Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment services.
(Ord. 14-290, 4-12-1989; 1988 Code)

8-2-6 Statement Of Charges; Delinquency
Statement: The Sewer Department, or such other person as the City Council may designate, shall furnish to each user by mail or leave at his place of residence or usual place of business, a written or printed statement stating the sewer service charges assessed against him/her once each month or at such other regular intervals as the City Council shall direct. The statement shall specify the amount of the bill, the place of payment, and the date due.
Notice of Discontinuance: If any person fails to pay his/her sewer charges within thirty (30) days of the date due, the City Recorder or the City Administrator shall give the customer notice in writing of the intent to discontinue the service of water to the premises unless the customer pays the bill in full within five (5) days from the date of notice.
Reconnection: If the water service is thereafter discontinued for failure to make payment of the sewer service charges, before the water service to the premises shall again be provided, all delinquent sewer charges must have been paid to the City Treasurer or arrangements made for their payment that are satisfactory to the City.
Additional Charges: In the event water is turned off for nonpayment of sewer charges, before the water services to the premises shall again be provided, the customer shall pay, in addition to all delinquent charges, such extra charge for turning the water on and off as the City Council may have established by resolution or ordinance.
Collection Enforcement: If any person fails to pay his/her sewer charges within thirty (30) days of the due date, the City Recorder or the City Administrator is hereby authorized to take all action necessary to enforce collection, including, but not limited to, the commencement of legal proceedings in a court of proper jurisdiction seeking judgment for all the amount of the delinquent fees and service charges and all costs of collection, including court costs and reasonable attorney fees.
(Ord. 88-1, 4-12-1989)

8-2-7 Installation And Connection To System
Separate Connections: A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where an accessory building stands at the rear of a main building and a private sewer cannot be constructed to the accessory building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway. In such case, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear accessory building and the whole considered as one building sewer. Both buildings must be under common ownership and the City does not and will not assume any obligation or responsibility for damage cause by or resulting from any such single connection Aforementioned. (Ord. 88-1, 4-12-1989)
Service Line Extension:
Once the application for sewer service has been made and accepted and the required fees have been paid by the applicant, the sewer line can be extended.
This subsection B refers to those extension lines installed at the time of initial construction of the sewer trunk lines. After the initial installation of a sewer trunk line, anyone connecting to the sewer line must make application to the Sewer Department as well as the Street Department. The applicant will bear all costs of materials and labor for sewer installation and for repair to streets, curbs, sidewalks, and landscape. A City employee or City inspector must be on site during the excavation, installation and backfill of any section of the sewer line on City property or right of way. Twenty four (24) hours’ notice for inspections is required. (Ord. 88-1, 4-12-1989; 1998 Code)
Permit:
Required: It shall be unlawful for any person to directly or indirectly engage in the laying, repairing, altering or connecting of any drain or sewer pipe connected with or part of the City sewer system without first having received a permit from the office of the City Recorder or the City.
Adequate Plumbing: Permits to connect to the City sewer system shall not be issued unless the plumbing in the house or building to be connected is in accordance with the provisions of the Building and Plumbing Codes of the City. (See Title 9 of this Code)
Licensed Plumber; Exception: It shall be unlawful for any person to connect any drain or sewer pipe with the City sewer system unless the person is a duly licensed plumber or unless, in the absence of a duly licensed plumber, any proposed connection to, alteration of, or change of connection to the sewer system shall be first submitted to the City Engineer for review and approval. After such approval, the installation or work done must be inspected by the City Engineer or his agent.
Ownership of Connecting Lines: Unless provision is expressly made for ownership of mains or lines by the owner of the adjacent property by means or written agreement, all lines and mains connecting the sewer system to a landowner and resident’s premises which are situated on the public way between the main and the property line shall be deemed to be the property of the City and subject to its absolute control and supervision, even though actual installation may have been performed by the owner or resident of the premises.
Issuance, Revocation of Permit: All construction permits for sewer connections or installations shall be issued to the plumber who is to do the work or to the owner of the property, with supervision and inspection by the City Administrator or his agents. The city Administrator or his agents may at any time revoke a permit because of defective work or because of undue delay in completing the permitted work.
(Ord. 88-1, 4-12-1989)

8-2-8 Materials And Construction
Code Compliance: The size, slope, alignment and materials of construction of all sanitary sewers, including building sewers, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes or other applicable rules and regulations of the City.
Compaction: At the time of installation of sewer lines or sewer service pipe, and thereafter as may be recommended or required by the City Engineer, compaction of all sewer lines or sewer service pipe trenches located within City rights or way shall be strictly required. Method of compaction shall be dependent upon the type of soil and location of the trench and shall be at the discretion of the City Engineer. Such trenches shall be approved by the City Engineer after on-site inspection and testing.
Excavation: All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from the hazards. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course or work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City.
Inspection: The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the City Engineer when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing must be made under the supervision of the City Engineer or his agent.
Service Lines:
Pipes in Good Repair: All users of the sewer services shall keep their service pipes, connection, and other apparatus in good repair and protected from frost at their own expense. No person, except under the direction of the City Engineer, shall be allowed to dig into the street for the purpose of removing or repairing any sewer service pipe or main.
Quality of Service Pipe: All service and other pipes used in conjunction with the sewer services of the City shall be of such material, quality and specifications as the City Council may from time to time by resolution provide and shall be installed at such distances below ground as may be specified by regulations relating to the Sewer Department. All work, alterations or extensions affecting sewer pipes shall be subject to the acceptance of the Public Works Director or City Engineer, and no connections with sewer mains shall be made without first obtaining a permit therefore from the City Recorder.
Old Service Connections: Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test, and the results reviewed, by the City Engineer, to meet all requirements of this Chapter.

A backflow prevention assembly required by this Chapter for control of backflow and cross-connections is not installed, tested, and maintained; or
If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or by-passed; or
If an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises; or
If the periodic system survey has not been conducted. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
Inspection of Customer’s System: The customer’s system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the water purveyor to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violation of this Chapter, exist and to audit the results of the required survey (subsection 8-3-3A2 of this Chapter).
Installation of Approved Prevention Assembly: Whenever the public water purveyor deems a service connection’s water usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line of the identified consumer’s water system, at or near the property line, or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line.

Previously Approved Assemblies: All presently install backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this Section but were approved assemblies for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection F of this Section, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water purveyor is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the water purveyor finds that the operation or maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaces by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the local and State requirements.
Inspection and Maintenance Requirements: It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified surveys or inspections, and operational tests made at least once per year at the consumer’s expense. In those instances where the public water purveyor deems the hazard to be great, he may require certified surveys or inspections and test at a more frequent interval. It shall be the duty of the public water purveyor to see that these tests are made according to the standards set forth by the State Department of Health, Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation.
Testing Backflow Prevention Assemblies: All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten (10) working days of initial installation.

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2019-008 on 4/9/2019
8-5-1 Intent And Purpose
The intent of this ordinance is to establish a municipal Secondary Irrigation Water System in Providence City.
This Secondary Water System, where applicable, will provide secondary water to the residents of Providence who decide to opt into the system.
The intent of this ordinance is to establish the legal framework by which residents, both current and future, may be provided an alternative to treated culinary water for irrigation uses.
Where applicable, the purpose of this ordinance is to make secondary irrigation water available to properties that are serviced by Providence City’s culinary water system.
It is the express intent of the Providence City Council by passage of this ordinance to encourage the use of secondary water for outdoor uses instead of treated culinary water which is primarily for indoor use.
The intent is to reduce the demand on the culinary system, where applicable, by providing untreated secondary water for irrigation purposes.
The use of culinary water for outdoor watering of lawns and gardens is discouraged when irrigation water is available from the Secondary Water System. 
The Intent is that all secondary water shall be put to beneficial use upon the property on which the secondary water is assigned under this ordinance.
The Secondary Water System is intended as a pressurized on-demand system. It should not require taking turns on a schedule.
The City will make every effort to encourage and incentivize residents to make connections to and use secondary water instead of culinary water for irrigation purposes.
It is the intent of Providence City to prepare and adopt a Secondary Water Master Plan which shall, among other things, identify areas which will likely be suitable for expansion of the Secondary Water System.
Areas under consideration for connection to the Secondary Water System are designated in Appendix A of this ordinance, “Secondary Water System Designated Service Areas.”
This ordinance is intended to accommodate additional service areas as the city develops. It is the intent that Appendix A of this ordinance, “Secondary Water System Designated Service Areas” will be updated with new areas of the city as needed or as requested.

It shall be unlawful for any User or Nonuser to access the City Service Valve after the initial construction is completed.
Inspection Prior to Approval: The Secondary Water Director shall ensure that each connection to the Secondary Water System has been inspected and approved before any new piping and connection is covered.
Water Use Agreement: 
Upon completion of the connection to the Secondary Water System, the parcel owner or their tenant shall submit a Water Use Agreement: Pressurized System, together with an Owner Acknowledgment and Guarantee and any requisite fees. The Owner Acknowledgement and Guarantee must be signed by the owner of the parcel and shall certify that the owner will pay all Water Service and associated fees if the owner’s tenant fails to pay for the Service.
Upon approval of the Water Use and Connection Agreement, the applicant may begin using water from the Secondary Water System.
Any time a parcel owner or tenant of a parcel changes, the new owner or tenant must submit a Water Use Agreement: Secondary Water System, an Owner Guarantee, and any requisite fees.
Period: Approved Water Use Agreements remain in effect for subsequent irrigation Seasons unless disconnected by the City.
Right of Refusal: The City reserves the right to reject any application for participation in the Secondary Water System if, in the opinion of the Secondary Water Director, participation would (a) significantly increase operational costs, (b) substantially impair water delivery to other users, or (c) otherwise prove detrimental to the Secondary Water System.

Service Time Frame.  The Secondary Water Director shall annually meet with a representative from each irrigation water company servicing the City to determine the upcoming year’s anticipated usage and coordinate operation and scheduling of the Secondary Water System. At the same time, a policy shall be prepared outlining the availability of water through the Secondary Water System and how the City shall deal with emergencies and contingencies that may reasonably arise in any given watering year.
Water Meters.  Water meters may be installed at the City’s discretion at irrigation system connections as the City Council may require meters to establish rates based on water usage.
Water Shortages.  In times of water scarcity, as by proclamation by the Mayor and City Council, the Secondary Water Director may limit the use of Secondary Water to such extent as may be necessary.  It is unlawful for any person, his family, or agents to violate any proclamation made by the Mayor and City Council in pursuance hereof.

To preserve the amenities and compatibility of P Districts by adoption of a general development plan, showing proper orientation, desirable design character, and compatible land uses.
To provide for the orderly pre-planning and long-term development for a variety of uses of large tracts of land which are under unified ownership or development control, so as to ensure that the entire tract will provide an environment of stable and desirable character.
To give the developer reasonable assurance that sectional development plans prepared in accordance with an approved general development plan will be acceptable to the local jurisdiction. Sectional development plans shall include subdivision plans and/or planned unit development plans as provided for in this Chapter.
To enable the adoption of measures providing for development of the surrounding area in character compatible with the Planned District.
Standards and Requirements: The following provisions shall apply in a P District, which District shall also be subject to other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, except that where conflict in regulations occurs, the regulations specified in this Chapter, or on a development plan approved pursuant to this Chapter, shall apply.
P Districts may be established on parcels of land which are suitable for, and of sufficient size to be planned and developed in a manner consistent with the purposes and objectives of this Chapter. No P District shall include less than ten (10) acres of contiguous land.
No ordinance establishing a P District shall be adopted unless and until there is on file with the local jurisdiction written consent of every property owner within such District at the time of adoption of the Ordinance, agreeing:

Before detailed studies of any P District development plans shall be undertaken by the planning staff or the planning commission, there shall be on file with the local jurisdiction the written request of all property owners within the proposed District that such detailed studies be made.
Standards for area, coverage, density, yard requirements, parking and screening for P District uses shall be governed by the standards of the residential, commercial, or industrial zoning districts most similar in nature and function to the proposed P District use(s), as determined by the Planning Commission, and as modified by the approved general development plan. Standards for public improvements shall be governed by applicable ordinances and laws. Exceptions to these standards by the Planning Commission and by the governing body are possible, when these bodies find that such exceptions encourage a desirable living environment and are warranted in terms of the total proposed development or unit thereof.
Preliminary Development Plan Approval:
Procedure and Applications. Prior to the filing of a formal P District rezoning application, the applicant shall submit a preliminary development plan for an approval in principle thereof by the planning commission and the governing body.
The preliminary development plan and text shall be prepared and endorsed by a qualified urban planner, with other professional assistance as required, and shall include the following information presented in a general schematic fashion:

The proposed P District or a given unit thereof, can be substantially completed within two (2) years of the establishment of the P District.
That each individual unit of development as well as the total development, can exist as an independent unit capable creating an environment of sustained desirability and stability, or that adequate assurance will be provided that such objective will be attained; and that the uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved under other zoning districts;
That the streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the P District;
That commercial development can be justified economically at the locations proposed to provide commercial facilities;

Upon application for rezoning of an area to a P District and recommendation of such rezoning by the Planning Commission, the governing body shall hold a public hearing thereon as required by other amendments to the zoning ordinance.
Changes of use or density of an approved general development plan shall be considered the same as a change in the zoning map, and shall be made in accordance with the provisions for amendments of the zoning ordinance. If no development has occurred to effectuate a P District development within two (2) years after the District is created, the Planning Commission shall review the action and determine whether or not the continuation of a given P District is in the public interest. If the Planning Commission so recommends, the governing body may order the area reverted to the original district from which it was created, without a public hearing.
At the time of adoption of any ordinance establishing a P District, the governing body shall make appropriate arrangements with the applicant to insure the accomplishment, at the scheduled times, of the public improvements, public dedications, and grants of easement shown on the approved general development plan. The P District shall be given an appropriate name, number of letter to identify it; and the approved general development plan shall be adopted by reference and become a part of the zoning ordinance.
10-4-4 Mixed Use District
Purpose: The Mixed Use District is established to stimulate economic development by providing a unique planning environment that combines retail commercial, office, and residential development in a pedestrian friendly manner. This district encourages creative development and site design. The MX District includes a mixture of uses with no one land use type being a constant dominate or prevailing use. However, residential development is required at a maximum of 39 dwelling units per acre.
Procedures:
The Planning Commission shall be the land use authority for approval of all development proposals in the MX District. All exterior construction visible from adjacent properties or public streets must also be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.
Prior to the Planning Commission taking action, plans must be submitted in accordance with the zoning ordinance.
All submissions shall be made in conformance with the adopted application and agenda deadline schedule.
Uses-Allowed: Uses are listed in 10-6-1. Any uses not listed on a table in that section are conditional uses not permitted. Any development in the MX District must include retail and either commercial or residential uses; and may include office and/or commercial.
Development Standards: The following provisions shall apply in a MX District, which District shall also be subject to other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, except that where conflict in regulations occurs, the regulation specified in this Chapter, or on a development plan approved pursuant to this Chapter, shall apply.
Open Space: Usable open space shall be provided within the mixed use development with the amount and type of open space depending upon size, scale, and nature of the development as determined by the Planning Commission. Approved open space may include but is not limited to: commons, pocket parks, plazas, courtyards, landscape features, water fountains and features, and greenbelts. Open space shall be maintained by owners or the homeowners association. The design shall encourage comfortable and safe pedestrian use, including landscaping, seating areas, and lighting as appropriate.
Standards for area, coverage, density, yard requirements, parking and screening for MX District uses shall be governed by the standards of the residential, commercial, or industrial zoning districts most similar in nature and function to the proposed MX District use(s), as determined by the Planning Commission, and as modified by the approved general development plan. Standards for public improvements shall be governed by applicable ordinances and laws. Exceptions to these standards by the Planning Commission and by the governing body are possible, when these bodies find that such exceptions encourage a desirable living environment and are warranted in terms of the total proposed development or unit thereof.
Horizontal Design. Mixed use projects can utilize horizontal design where commercial, office, and residential uses are designed as a single project, yet constructed in separate and distinct building footprints.
Vertical Design. Vertical design mixed use uses design strategies where commercial,
office, and residential uses are designed as a single project and constructed within the same building footprint. Vertical mixed use promotes pedestrian oriented commercial and retail uses on the main level and office and/or residential uses on the upper floors.
Mixed use projects utilizing vertical mixed use are eligible for a residential density bonus of up to 30% (39 units per acre) provided other applicable standards are met.
Maximum building height within the MX District shall be 45'. Building height is defined in Providence City Code 10-1-4.
Uses: The variety of uses allowed in a MX District are intended to create a mix of retail, commercial (including but not limited to: entertainment, office, personal services), and residential dwelling land use types that can be developed in a compact design that encourages compatibility of uses. Of the uses included in the development, no one use can be less than 20% of the entire development.
Architectural Design and Materials: The treatment of building mass, materials and exterior appurtenances shall create an aesthetically pleasing building and site that is in character with the proportions of other surrounding developments. Proposed developments shall be designed with a common theme that reflects the heritage and community of Providence and traditional small town streetscapes. The use of theme in a proposed development shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission. Requirements applicable to all buildings are stated below: 
All sides of buildings shall receive equal design consideration, particularly where exposed to vehicular or pedestrian traffic and adjacent properties. Façade shifts shall be encouraged on structures with a width greater than 50 feet.
Basic exterior construction materials shall be limited to no more than three types of materials per building and all buildings within the development shall possess a similar architectural theme. Building styles shall be compatible with existing buildings in the MX District.
Buildings shall be designed to relate to grade conditions with a minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls.
Mechanical equipment shall be located or screened so as not to be visible from public and private streets. Screens shall be aesthetically incorporated into the design of the building whether located on the ground or on the roof. Screen materials shall be compatible with those of the building.
Plans for the exterior modifications to any existing structures must be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval and must meet the same requirements as all other structures within the MX District.
The primary entrance to a building shall be located facing the public street. Entrances at a building corner that faces the street may be used to meet this requirement.
Buffers, Fences, and Walls: The intent in having special buffer, fence, and wall requirements is to provide quality separation between incompatible commercial uses, and to provide physical and visual protection between commercial and residential uses.
Landscape buffers are preferred over fences and walls where a separation is desirable. A visually open look should be encouraged between similar uses. Visual screening is often more important than a physical separation and the Planning Commission may, at its own option, require special treatment of such areas.
Buffer treatment may be required whenever a change occurs between residential and nonresidential uses. Additional landscaping and screening may be required at the discretion of the Planning Commission within the setback which separates the uses. Fences or walls will be reviewed for their effectiveness in screening a view, and for their color and texture in relationship to building materials.
Where differing uses are to be developed adjacent to existing residential areas, special consideration shall be made to protect the privacy of residents and requirements shall be the discretion of the Planning Commission. As a minimum, the negative effects of noise and artificial lighting shall be minimized to protect existing residents.
Service areas shall be properly screened. Outdoor lighting shall be designed to prevent exposure of light source to the view of residents. Facilities that require late night customers and activities shall be located away from residential areas to reasonable prevent the disruption of privacy.
Parking Areas: Parking areas shall be considered as structures since they present a three dimensional appearance when occupied.
Parking lots shall be located in the central portions of the development and not along streets so they can service a variety of buildings. Location of parking shall be determined not only from its visual relationship to building and site, but also as it relates to safe convenient pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns. The placing of building and parking elements on a site shall be evaluated by the Planning Commission on the basis of the following factors:
Type of land use and structure.
Building height and configuration.
Relationship to other buildings both horizontally and vertically.
Natural land features such as slopes and vegetation.
Physical features such as rail lines, canals, and controlled ingress and egress.
Visibility from vehicular approaches and distant highways.
Parking locations are strongly encouraged on the side and to the rear of any proposed structures, with minimum parking between the front of the building and the street.
Cooperation among neighboring land owners and tenants to share parking for the public and/or employees is encouraged. The availability of shared parking may be used as a justification for the approval of development design and configuration proposals that would otherwise not be approved.
Parking shall not occur adjacent to any public street except when:
It has been established that such a location is needed or justified by other site or building entrance orientation.
The use is restricted to visitors and/or key employees.
Parking is 80% screened by fencing, walls, and/or landscaping from the highway or street by either depressing the paved areas or using elevated landscape berms.
A minimum of 10 feet of landscaped screening consisting of mixed evergreen and deciduous trees shall surround the periphery of paved areas adjacent to buildings or property lines. The number of trees for this area shall be determined by a standard of 1 tree per every 200 square feet of landscaping required,
Parking requirements will be considered as maximum parking requirements. Residential units will require at least one and a half spaces per unit. Non residential uses may consider the parking available on public streets as meeting the development requirements.
Signage: Proper design and placement of signs and their lighting is critical and shall be compatible with structures and uses. Permitted signs within the MX District shall be in compliance with this code, except that off-premise signs or billboards shall not be permitted. Typical retail signage is designed upon a pedestrian scale located 8 – 12 feet above the sidewalk and placed on the store fronts.
Landscaping: Landscaping shall comply with landscaping requirements in commercial Districts except as approved by the Planning Commission in the process of reviewing a MX District Development.
Service and Loading Areas: Loading and refuse collections areas shall not be permitted between buildings and streets, and must be screened from view of public and private streets. Streets shall not be used directly for loading, unloading, or refuse collection. Building and improvements upon lots must be designed to properly accommodate loading, unloading and refuse collection. Loading and refuse collection areas shall be properly screened meeting standards stated herein.
General Maintenance: An overall maintenance schedule shall be implemented by property owners in maintaining all buildings, landscaping, fences, walls, drives, and parking lots (including surfacing and striping, signs, or other structures). The above shall be maintained in good and sufficient repair in a safe and aesthetically pleasing manner. Roads and pavements shall be kept true to line and grade and in good repair.

10-4-6 Life Cycle Residential
Purpose and Intent: It is the intent of this zone to guide development in accordance with the following goals:
Provide attractively landscaped neighborhoods with a mix of single-family, two-family and multi-family residential lots, structures, and associated uses, in areas where slopes do not exceed twenty percent (20%). Areas with slopes in excess of twenty percent (20%) shall be subject to Providence City Code Chapter 5 of this Title, Sensitive Areas.
Provide an integrated design for the development of residential uses to allow flexibility and initiative in site and building design and location in accordance with an approved plan and imposed general requirements as specified by this chapter.
Maintain a residential character compatible with surrounding traditional single-family neighborhoods.
This chapter provides enabling authority and standards for the review, and approval of applications for Life Cycle Residential (LCR) developments. The intent of this ordinance is to provide an alternative to traditional subdivision design by encouraging innovation and offering flexibility in the design of residential developments, which will result in the enjoyment and benefit of the citizens of Providence, both current and future.
Compliance with Standards: Substantial compliance with the zone regulations and other provisions of this title in requiring adequate standards related to the public health, safety and general welfare shall be observed, without unduly inhibiting the advantages of large scale site planning for residential and related purposes.
Housing Definitions: The types of dwelling units permitted in an LCR zone shall have the definitions found in Providence City Code 10-1-4.
Zone Location: The LCR is intended to be located in many areas throughout Providence. An LCR is a rezone.

Diversity of Housing Types. No more than fifty percent (50%) of the total dwelling units in any project governed by this ordinance shall be composed of any one type of housing. Regardless of project size, all projects are required to have a minimum of twenty-percent (20%) of dwelling units in the project be composed of single-family detached housing.
Minimum Lot Width, Apartments. The required lot width for apartments shall be based on the number of buildings of apartments on the lot. Each lot containing apartments shall have a minimum of 50’ lot width, plus an additional 60’ for each building containing apartments.
Setbacks for Single Family Attached and Apartment Housing. No front or rear building setback is in place for single family attached and apartment housing, provided that the development’s open space is integrated throughout the project so that each group of single family attached dwelling units and each building of apartments has a minimum of 10’ of landscaped open space on all sides, said landscaping being calculated from the front/rear plane of the dwelling unit or exterior wall of the apartment building, with the exception of one side of single-family attached which may be needed for alley garage access. Buildings whose front plane faces the front plane of another building shall have a minimum of 20’ separation between the buildings’ front planes.
All other development standards, shall be complied with as outlined in the Providence City Subdivision ordinance and engineering design standards.
Development Standards: In addition to development standards contained herein, all projects developed under the LCR zone shall be developed and landscaped in accordance with the Providence City Multi-Family Design Standards.
Phasing: As part of the application for a rezone to an LCR, developers shall be required to submit a proposed concept/phasing plan for the project. Said phasing plan shall tentatively outline what types and numbers of various housing types shall be constructed in each phase. The final phasing plan shall be incorporated into a Master Development Agreement, which shall be prepared and developed by the City at the time an LCR project is given preliminary plat approval and shall be recorded against the property at that time. The phasing of an LCR project shall follow Providence City Code 11-3-2-B-4, with the exception of 11-3-2-B-4-D, which requires each phase to be a stand-alone phase. However, no more than two phases of an LCR project may be constructed before at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the single-family detached must be presented for final plat approval.

10-5-2 Sensitive Areas
Sensitive areas are defined as follows:

Non-developable sensitive areas:

The following areas are non-developable. None of the acreage encumbered by any of the following sensitive areas may be considered for development density, and none of the areas may be built upon or within except for required public utility and facilities.
Jurisdictional Wetlands: As defined by the US Army Corps of Engineers.
Steep Slopes: Where the rise or fall of the land is equal to or exceeds thirty percent (30%) over a horizontal distance of fifty feet (50’) or greater (see Section 4 of this Chapter) measured perpendicular to the contour lines.
Natural Waterways or Open Water: Including but not limited to: rivers, creeks, or streams. Identified as those areas where surface waters flow sufficiently to produce a defined channel or bed. A defined channel or bed is indicated by hydraulically sorted sediments or the removal of vegetation litter or loosely rooted vegetation by action of moving water. The channel or bed need not contain water year round. This definition is not meant to include storm water runoff devices or entirely artificial watercourse unless they are used to store or convey pass through stream flows naturally occurring prior to construction of such devices. Watercourses where the definition may apply are those that appear on the US geological survey quad maps excluding irrigation canals and ditches. For instance, an irrigation canal following a natural or jurisdictional watercourse would not be exempt but others would be exempt.
Potentially developable sensitive areas:

The following areas are determined to be sensitive areas of Providence City and are subject to the requirements of this Chapter. These areas may be built upon based on the requirements of this section and other applicable city, state, and federal requirements.

All acreage encumbered by any of the following sensitive areas may be considered for development density at the discretion of the Providence City Planning Commission, based on recommendations from professional(s) with expertise in the field being discussed.
Steep Slopes Where the rise or fall of the land is between twenty percent (20%) and thirty percent (30%) over a horizontal distance of fifty feet (50’) or greater. (see Section 4 of this Chapter) measured perpendicular to the contour lines.
Floodplains See definitions in Chapter 16 Section 3 of this Title.
Crucial wildlife habitat areas as identified by the State Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR).
Geological hazard areas Earthquake fault lines or areas prone to debris flows, landslides, high or extreme liquefaction potential, and rock falls as identified by the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Wildfire hazards areas: Areas of the City designated as having moderate to extreme potential for wildfire hazards as identified by the City.
Development of Sensitive Areas:
No land designated as a Non Developable Sensitive Area may be considered for development density or disturbed in any manner during the development of adjacent lands except as reasonably necessary for the installation of required public utilities.
The lands within a Potentially Developable Sensitive Area may be developed and built upon, subject to the requirements of this section and other applicable city, state, and federal requirements.
Land within a Potentially Developable Sensitive Area maybe considered for development density at the discretion of the Providence City Planning Commission, based on recommendations from professional(s)with expertise in the field being discussed.
The designation of land as within a Non-developable Sensitive Area or within a Potentially Developable Sensitive Area, and the application of other requirements imposed under the authority of this chapter may be appealed to the Providence City Appeal Authority, as provided for in Chapter 2-5 of this Code.
10-5-3 Hazard Flood Area (HF)
An Area which may be subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commercial and City services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which could adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City. The Hazard Flood Area (HF) is based upon the flood hazard data provided to the City by FEMA. Flood hazard data will be provided in the form of a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) (hereafter referred to as the “flood map”) and a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) (hereafter referred to as the “flood study”).
Building Regulations: No dwelling unit, accessory building, church, school, public building, health care facility, residence or nursing home for the elderly or handicapped, nor any commercial, retail or industrial structure shall be constructed within a minimum distance as determined by the City from the top inside edge of the bank of any natural or manmade waterway that is located in a Hazard Flood Area (HF). Under no circumstance shall any structure be permitted or constructed within thirty feet (30') of the top inside edge of the bank of any natural or manmade waterway that is located in a Hazard Flood Area (HF).
See Chapter 16 of this Title for flood plain regulations.
10-5-4 Hazard Slope Area (HS)
Conditional Use Permit Required: An area where the natural slope of the land exceeds an average gradient through the building areas of thirty percent (30%) or greater and lands within thirty feet (30’) of any slope falling away at a grade of thirty percent (30%) or greater is designated as a Hazard Slope Area. Within the Hazard Slope Area, no construction or earth moving activity shall occur until a conditional use permit has been obtained in compliance with the provisions of Section 10-3-5 of this Title. A conditional use permit shall not be considered until adequate plans and engineering data are delivered to the City showing that:
No building or structure is to be located on any existing slope with an average gradient through the building area of thirty percent (30%) or greater, nor within thirty feet (30') of any slope falling away at a grade of thirty percent (30%) or greater; and
A detailed erosion control, revegetation and bank stabilization plan has been approved by the City Engineer for any disturbances planned to existing slopes within a Hazard Slope Area; and
A detailed site plan for any buildings or earth moving activities (roads, driveways, sewer or water lines, etc.) that show the location of the planned facilities and how they would fit in with the existing slope and landscape of the area (as shown by before and after contours – see 4. below) has been approved by the designated Land Use Authority.
Contours should show the following:

Natural Ground: Unimproved earthen material existing at its original location of formation or deposition, which has not been reworked, mechanically altered, constructed or improved.

Existing conditions: The ground as is presently exists.

Proposed conditions: The ground after the earth moving activities have taken place.
New Subdivisions: In the case of new subdivisions, these conditional use permit requirements for all public facilities (roads, sewer and water lines, etc.) within a Hazard Slope Area (HS) shall be included in the final plat and construction drawing phases of the approval process and approval of the final plat shall serve as the conditional use permit for roads, sewer, and water line and similar utility and infrastructure uses within the Hazard Slope Area. An additional conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of buildings or structures, including homes, garages, and other such improvements within the Hazard Slope Area (HS).
10-5-5 Hazard Water Table Area (HW)
An area where potential ground water levels may occur within 12 feet of the natural grade is designated as a Hazard Water Table Area. Within a Hazard Water Table Area, no permit shall be issued for any construction or use until a conditional use permit has been obtained in compliance with the provisions of Section 10-3-5 of this Title. A conditional use permit shall not be approved until adequate plans and engineering data are delivered to the Land Use Authority showing that no basement or cellar is to be built, that the percentage of the lot, parcel or site to be covered by buildings, parking spaces and paved surfaces does not exceed forty percent (40%) of the area of the lot, parcel or site and that the proposed use is not of a character to increase quantities of chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides or minerals or in any other way likely to contaminate the groundwater.

10-5-6 Hazard Earthquake Primary Fault Area (HE)
No construction shall be permitted in any identified Hazard Earthquake Primary Fault Area (HE) and/or landslide area until a conditional use permit has been obtained in compliance with the provisions of Section 10-3-5 of this Title. Said conditional use permit shall not be given until adequate plans and engineering data are provided showing:

Location of Structures: Where public facilities, occupancy facilities, large structures and sewer and water systems are to be constructed. Detailed geotechnical investigations may be required so as to accurately and very specifically locate faults and/or landslide areas;
Lines and Systems: Any sewer lines or disposal systems located beneath culinary water facilities; and
Ground Response Map: Ground response maps identifying the area’s most susceptible to ground motion.
(Zon. Ord., 5-8-1991)

10-5-7 Hazard Wildfire Area (WF)
Areas having moderate to extreme potential for wildfire hazards are designated as the Hazard Wildfire Areas. Within the Hazard Wildfire Area:

Development shall provide for ready access to fire and other emergency equipment and for routes of escape to safely handle evacuations.
Measures to mitigate wildfire hazards and risks may be required by the appropriate Land Use Authority based on the recommendation and review of the Fire Marshall.
Property owners are encouraged to implement the following:
Construct the roof with fire-resistant materials like tile or metal, asphalt or fiberglass shingles. Clean roof surfaces and gutters of pine needles, leaves, branches, etc. regularly to avoid accumulation of flammable materials.
Inspect your property regularly, clearing dead wood and dense vegetation from at least 30’ around your house. Rake piles of leaves and twigs. If on a hill, more space will be needed to protect your home. A fuel break should be maintained around all structures.
 Move firewood away from the house or attachments like fences or decks.
Cover vents with wire mesh no larger than 1/8 of an inch to keep sparks from enter your home through vents.
Driveways should be wide enough for firefighting equipment to maneuver.
10-5-8 Engineering Geotechnical Report
For those areas identified as an active or potential mapped earthquake fault and landslide areas, or areas determined by review to contain geologically unstable conditions, and all for areas which include a Hazard Slope Area (HS) or Hazard Primary Fault Area (HE), development may be permitted by the designated Land Use Authority upon the review and approval of an engineering geotechnical report that complies with the provisions of this section. If a conditional use permit is required, the engineering geotechnical report shall be considered in the review of the conditional use permit application.

The site-specific soil/geologic report by a qualified geotechnical engineer shall identify all geologic hazards, whether on or off-site, if such hazard or hazards affects the particular property including the following hazard(s), unless determined prior to the preparation of the report by the City Engineer that the specific potential hazard or hazard does not need to be considered in the report:
Flood history and potential; proximity to known canals, lakes, streams and alluvial fan flooding;
Definition of any areas of deformation with respect to active faults and recommended setbacks therefrom;
Evidence for other mass movement of soil and rock (landslides, debris flows, rock falls);
Identification of anomalies of the terrain or characteristics of the geological materials which would have any potential impact upon the use of site;
Determination of ground water characteristics; and
Uncontrolled fill material within the building envelope of a lot or other uncompacted soils.
The report shall contain written recommendations for construction of structures and avoidance or mitigation of the hazards. Land drains alone through private property are not allowed and are discouraged through public property because long-term maintenance of drains cannot be guaranteed;
The report shall consider and contain data regarding the nature, distribution, and strength of soils within the project area. The soil report shall include a unified classification of all soils with an estimate of susceptibility to erosion, plasticity index, liquid limit, shrink-swell potential, and general suitability for development;
The report shall contain an estimate of the likely highest level of the water table considering the long-term effects of development and irrigation.
The report shall include a statement by the qualified geotechnical engineer preparing the report that the safety and integrity of the proposed building or structure is not compromised by potential geologic hazards and that the proposed building or structure, as designed and proposed, can be built in a manner that complies with the soils, footings and foundation requirements of the applicable building code.
After the application is received by the City, the geologic and soil report will be reviewed by staff and, if the report finds that geologic hazards exist, the report will be reviewed by other geotechnical advisors which may include the Utah Geologic Survey (UGS). If after review, the geotechnical advisors concur with the geologic and soil report and the proposed remedial measures submitted by the applicant, the item will be forwarded to the land use authority designated to review the application for a conditional use permit.
The required reports and the plans to address the concerns set forth in those reports shall be stamped and approved by a licensed professional engineer. If the City Engineer does not agree with the applicant's geologic and soils report, the City and the applicant for a conditional use permit may utilize the procedure for resolving such disputes found in Utah Code Ann. 10-9a-703(20 for the appeal of a determination made under a municipality’s geologic hazards ordinance.
As provided in Section 10-3-5(E)(4) of this Ordinance, a conditional use permit may be denied, and use of the property therefore prohibited, if geologic hazards associated with the property cannot be substantially mitigated by the imposition of reasonable conditions and/or the requirements of the geologic and soil report and the provisions of the applicable building code related to soils, footings, and foundations are not met.
10-5-9 Disclosure Of Natural Hazard By Engineering Geotechnical Report
Wherever a potential natural hazard is identified by a required geotechnical report under this chapter, the owner of such parcel shall record a restrictive covenant running with the land in a form satisfactory to the City prior to the approval of any development or subdivision of such parcel, which shall include the following:

Notice of the existence and availability of the engineering geotechnical report that identifies the natural hazards for public inspection in the City Office; and
An agreement by the owner of the parcel and any successor in interest to comply with any conditions set by the City to minimize potential adverse effects of the natural hazard(s).
10-5-10 Disclosure Of Other Natural Hazards
At any time after the designation of a particular parcel of land, or any portion thereof, as within a Sensitive Land Area, the City may cause to be recorded at the Office of the Cache County Recorder a notice related to that land stating that the land lies within a Sensitive Land Area. The notice may state that the construction of buildings and improvements on that land is subject to the provisions of the Providence City Ordinances related to Sensitive Lands, including a potential requirement to obtain a conditional use permit prior to the construction of a home or other buildings, structures or improvements on the land. Use of the land may not be allowed until a professional review is conducted, as provided in city ordinance, and reports are submitted that establish that any proposed home, building, or other structures or improvements to be erected upon the land can be built in compliance with relevant building codes and appropriate soil, flooding, and earthquake requirements. If qualified professionals cannot establish that a proposed use of the land can be conducted in a manner that complies with the health and safety provisions of the building code and other relevant standards, the proposed use of the land may be prohibited.

Amended by Ord. 2020-003 on 2/19/2020
10-8-2 Lot Size
Lot Areas – Flexibility Exception:
The individual lot size must meet the minimum square footage requirements as indicated in the space requirement chart, as set forth in Section 10-8-1 of this Chapter. The following exception applies in a subdivision of six (6) lots or more in SFE, SFL and SFT Zones.
Purpose: To provide a means for desirable development, utilizing public facility space and open space, through the use of variations in lot size and frontage width. This is not intended to increase density.
The average of all lots must be equal to or greater than the minimum lot size for the zone, excluding non-residential uses such as schools, churches, etc.
The number of lots cannot exceed the maximum units for the zone.
A limit of ten percent (10%) of the lots can be less than the minimum lot size and/or reduced frontage width, but no lot can be less than twelve thousand (12,000) square feet in the subdivision and the frontage requirement at the setback line must be a minimum of eighty feet (80').
In areas that contain sensitive areas and hazard zoned (see Chapter 5 of this Title) thirty percent (30%) of the lots can be less than the minimum lot size and/or reduced frontage width, but no lot can be less than twelve thousand (12,000) square feet in the subdivision and the frontage requirement at the setback line must be the minimum for the zone.
Lots having less area than required, which were officially recorded with the Cache County Recorder’s office at the effective date hereof, may continue to be used; provided, that all other requirements set forth herein are satisfied.

A deck is considered as an exterior floor system supported on at least two opposing sides by adjoining structures and/or posts, piers or other independent supports.
A deck which is less than 120 square feet and less than 30 inches above adjacent grade, and independently supported, will not require a building permit and is not considered part of the main structure.
An attached covered deck is considered part of the main dwelling and required to meet the associated setbacks.
A portion of an attached uncovered deck may project into the required rear yard no more than ½ of the distance of the required rear yard (ie: required rear yard is 20 feet, the deck can project no more than 10 feet into the required yard); and, the projection may take up no more than 50% the required rear yard. The projection of the deck is included in the overall 25% limitation in Chapter 9 Section 6 of this Title.

(Ordinance Modification 019-99 07/27/99) A business that locates the parking in the rear of the building rather than the front will be allowed a front yard setback of 15 feet. The standard front yard setback will be used when a business locates the parking in the front of the building. When parking is allowed on the street adjacent to the building the standard front yard setback applies. (Ordinance Modification 009-2002 06/11/02)
Parking aisles shall not exceed forty (40) cars in a row. Total parking area shall be broken down into sections not to exceed one hundred (100) cars. Each section shall be separated by internal drives to improve traffic circulation.

The owner, tenant and agent shall be jointly and individually responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in good condition and free from refuse and debris so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance. The landscaped public area between the curb, gutter, and sidewalk is not used to meet the landscape requirements. See Title 7 Chapter 1 Section 8 of this code for park strip requirements.
Design initiatives.
To establish landscape themes that include street trees and streetscape designs throughout the City to promote and overall character and identity to the community.
Promote innovative and cost-conscious approaches to the design, installation, and maintenance of landscaping while encouraging water and energy conservation.
Promote planting techniques that ensure long term health of plant materials.
Screen unsightly building structures, equipment or materials from the view of persons on public streets or adjoining properties of incompatible land uses.
Definitions:
Buffering: plants placed intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences, and other barriers to create a softening effect.
Landscaping: vegetative plantings such as grass, trees, shrubs, vines and related improvements such as pools, walkways, rockwork and sculpture which is of a design that will beautify and enhance a property, control erosion and reduce glare.
Screening: masonry wall, fence, hedge, berm, or vegetative planning or combination thereof which is of a design (height, width, material, etc.) that will provide a visual and audible barrier between land uses having different intensities of use.
Large retail buildings (15,000 square feet and larger): shall require at least ten percent (10%) of the total lot be landscaped.
Retail buildings (detached - less than 15,000 square feet): shall require at least ten percent (10%) of the total lot be landscaped.
A ten foot (10’) wide minimum landscaped area shall be provided around the entire building, with the exception of where loading docks, ramps, etc. are located. Up to five feet (5’) of said ten foot (10’) minimum may be sidewalk. The Administrative Land Use Authority may provide for an exception to this requirement if soil types make it inadvisable to have irrigation near the building. In such case, the required amount of landscaping shall be provided elsewhere on the property.
Professional / Office buildings: shall require at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total lot be landscaped.
A ten foot (10’) wide minimum landscaped area shall be provided around the entire building, with the exception of where loading docks, ramps, etc. are located. Up to five feet (5’) of said ten foot (10’) minimum may be sidewalk. The Administrative Land Use Authority may provide for an exception to this requirement if soil types make it inadvisable to have irrigation near the building. In such case, the required amount of landscaping shall be provided elsewhere on the property.
Industrial / warehouse buildings: shall require at least ten percent (10%) of the total lot be landscaped.
A ten foot (10’) wide minimum landscaped area shall be provided around the entire building, with the exception of where loading docks, ramps, etc. are located. Up to five feet (5’) of said ten foot (10’) minimum may be sidewalk. The Administrative Land Use Authority may provide for an exception to this requirement if soil types make it inadvisable to have irrigation near the building. In such case, the required amount of landscaping shall be provided elsewhere on the property.
Parking Areas: Landscaping in parking area shall be designed to provide the following:
Incorporate appropriate plantings that are in scale with their surroundings.
Separate roadways, travel paths, pedestrian paths etc. using landscaped islands and /or planter strips.
Define area where pedestrians are safely separated from the travel path / roads.
Reinforce way-finding by emphasizing entrances and circulations patterns.
Add aesthetic value, provide canopy shade, reduce radiant hear from the surface, reduce headlight glare, and add seasonal interest.
When possible, preserve mature trees and other significant landscape features which help define the character of the City.
When planted parking medians are used, they shall be a minimum of 10 6 feet (10’ 6’) wide.
Planted islands shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) square feet.
Xeriscape. Xeriscape is landscaping that reduces or eliminates the need for supplemental water from irrigation. It is different from natural landscaping, because the emphasis is on selection of plants for water conservation, not necessarily selecting native plants. Xeriscape landscaping can work well in Utah’s desert climate. Xeriscape landscape is not zero-scape; it is an area filled with color, scent and variety. Trees can be used effectively in xeriscape and with property planning, planting, and care, they will thrive in low-water landscape.
Low Impact Development (LID). LID is a stormwater management approach with a basic principle that is modeled after nature: manage rainfall at the source using uniformly distributed decentralized micro-scale controls. LID’s goal is to mimic a sites predevelopment hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff close to its source. Developments are encouraged to implement LID’s.
Trees. One tree (minimum two inch (2”) caliper, minimum 10 feet in height) shall be planted and maintained for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of landscaped area. Trees in portable planters shall not qualify to meet the tree requirements.
Trees within overhead utility easements shall be of a type that customarily grows to a height not exceeding fifteen feet.
Plants. The selection of plant materials should consider public health and safety. Plants to be avoided include those with poisonous fruits, large thorns, or invasive growth patterns. The ultimate form and height of plantings as they mature should be considered so they will not create unsafe conditions or block sight lines for pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorists.
Planting beds may be mulched with bark chips, decorative stone, or similar materials. Mulch shall not be used as a substitute for plants.
Landscaped buffer. A landscaped buffer is defined as a landscaped area whereby trees and other plan materials are used to create a wide, landscaped park- or garden-like area around the perimeter, or in the side and/or rear yard, of a property in order to physically and visually separate and mitigate undesirable environmental impacts (such as: noise, dust, stormwater, etc.) between commercial zones and residential zones. Generally accepted scale for landscape buffers. The following minimum and maximum width of transitional yards and screening should be used between commercial and residential uses:
Minimum width: 10 feet
Maximum width: 50 feet
Where commercial buildings are less than 5,000 square feet in area, a minimum 10 feet buffer is substantial. Otherwise if the building area is greater than 5,000 square feet in area, a landscape buffer should be a minimum 25 feet.

Landscaped Buffer
Planting materials in the landscape buffer.
Choose plants that will naturally grow to the desired form or height to reduce maintenance. No limbing up (this will lessen the life and strength of the tree).
Tree canopies should have a natural growth height of at least 8 feet from the ground when located around areas in the clear-view area (see Chapter 9 of this Title). Tree canopies should have a natural growth height of at least 4 feet from the ground when located around parking areas, walkways, etc.
New trees and shrubs should be evenly spaced at planting, with trees having an 8-foot minimum installed height, and shrubs having a 36-inch minimum installed height.
Landscaping in the landscape buffer should consist of a minimum of 6 large maturing trees (minimum 50% evergreen) and 40 medium shrubs (minimum 75% evergreen) for each 100 linear feet, to provide continuous coverage. For dimensions of less than 100 feet, plantings and spacing will be in proportion to the basic ratio.
Snow storage. Landscape materials surrounding parking lots and in islands and medians should be able to tolerate large quantities of snow stored during winter months. Delicate plant material should not be used in area where they are likely to be damaged by snow.
Lighting. The intent of lighting is to provide the necessary lighting to ensure pedestrian safety, night vision for pedestrians and automobiles, add aesthetic value to the city appearance, and not create or cause excessive glare onto adjacent properties.
Lighting height and location shall be designed to illuminate the site only. Light cutoffs are required to prevent spillover of direct light.
Pedestrian street lights or lampposts located within the public right-of-way are required in all commercial zones.
Pedestrian street lights or lampposts located within the public right-of-way shall be mounted between 8’ to 16’ above grade to provide illumination of street sidewalks.
Pedestrian street lights or lampposts shall reflect the architectural design characteristic of the surrounding area.
Up-lighting is not permitted, except as approved through the site plan review for highlighting signature landscape features or building elements.
HID or fluorescent tube lights (except compact fluorescent bulbs) are not permitted as exterior building lights.
Floodlights or directional lights permitted for the lighting of alleys, parking garages and outdoor working areas must be shielded or directed to prevent the source of light (bulb or lamp) from being seen from adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.
All landscape plans submitted for approval shall contain the following information unless specifically waived by the City. At the discretion of the City a final landscaped plan may require a stamp from a Utah Licensed Landscape Architect.
The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, property lines easements, parking lots and drives, roadways and rights of way, sidewalks, bicycle paths, ground signs, bicycle parking areas, fences, freestanding electrical equipment, tot lots, and other recreation facilities.
The location, quantity, size and name, both botanical and common names, of all proposed plants.
The location, size and common names, of all existing plants including trees and other plants in the parkway, and indicating plants to be retained and removed.
The locations of existing buildings and structures on adjacent property within twenty feet (20’) of the site.
Location and heights of fences and retaining walls proposed on the site.
At the discretion of the City a final irrigation plan may require a stamp from a Utah Licensed Landscape Architect.
Completion; Performance Security. No requests for any building, structure or other improvements shall be approved until site and landscape plans have been approved by the Administrative Land Use Authority; and a preconstruction meeting held (Ord. No. 2018-011, 10-23-2018).
Preconstruction Meeting. A Pre-Construction Meeting will be held with the developer, general contractor for the Development, and City Staff prior to beginning any construction in the Development, including grading and trenching.
It is the developer’s responsibility to notify the general contractor and all appropriate subcontractors for the Development of their required attendance at the Pre Construction Meeting and that no construction can commence until after that meeting.
The Storm Water Notice of Intent (NOI) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) must be in place prior to the preconstruction meeting.
Landscaping and site developments in accordance with the approved plans shall be installed within thirty (30) days following occupancy of the building.
If said completion date is impossible due to adverse weather conditions, a mutually agreed upon completion date shall be determined by the City and the applicant, but in no case shall the completion date be more than one hundred fifty (150) days from the date of occupancy. The developer (or owner) shall hereby deposit a security of performance as specified in subsections 11-5-7B through C of the Subdivision Title as security to assure compliance with all landscaping and site requirements. If the developer or an agent of the developer fails to comply with the above installation and time requirements, the security of performance may be foreclosed upon by the City to cover costs of installing, repairing or replacing said landscaping and site developments.
Undeveloped Area: All areas of the parcel on which development is taking place shall be regulated by this chapter. Land which is not covered by the building(s), parking lots, roads, landscaping or otherwise improved shall, as a minimum, be restored with natural vegetation and maintained so as not to create a weed nuisance (see Title 4 Chapter 2 of this Code), or the area may be maintained in agricultural production.

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2019-003 on 2/12/2019
10-13-1 Purpose And Intent
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a city ordinance governing the construction and use of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). ADUs are separate dwelling units detached from the primary residence. Chapter 12 of this title covers Accessory Apartment Units (AAU) which are attached to the primary residence. 

It is the policy of Providence City to promote and encourage the creation of legal ADUs in a manner that enhances residential neighborhoods while respecting the existing look and scale of single-family dwellings. The intent of this ordinance is to provide for a broader range of affordable housing options that generate these benefits:
•	Provides an alternative for older homeowners who want to remain in their home and would like a family member, caretaker or renter to help make that possible so that elderly can “age in place” rather than inhabit senior living centers.
•	Make housing affordable for young people to live in desirable communities where single-family homes are out of their reach.
•	Contribute to solving the housing shortage.
•	Opens up areas for development potential without threatening the existing character of a neighborhood.
•	Adds inexpensive rental units to the housing stock to meet the needs of smaller households, both old and young.
•	Develops housing units in single-family neighborhoods to serve the needs of the residents through a variety of stages in the life cycle, thereby lessening fluctuations in neighborhood demand for services.
•	Requirement that owner be on the premises decreases the chance of ADU tenants inflicting nuisances on the surrounding neighborhood.
•	Provide a extra living space for a growing family.
•	Is intended to be a family friendly ordinance allowing for young and old to live together, for grown children to stay in the community that they love.
•	Enhance neighborhood stability with owners more likely to remain; allow current neighbors to stay through different stages of life.
•	Promotes more efficient use of existing housing stock and City infrastructure.

Ordinance No. 002-2011, 04/26/2011; 019-2016, 08/09/2016

10-16-1 Intent And Purpose
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established with the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.

The intent of this Chapter is to make sure that the City’s flood plain management regulations meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the NFIP and any additional state requirements.
The purpose of this Chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific area by provisions designed to:
Protect human life and health; 
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas lines, storm water facilities, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
10-16-2 Basis Of Flood Plain Management Regulations
The basis of the City’s floodplain management regulations is the flood hazard data provided to the City by FEMA. Flood hazard data will be provided in the form of a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) (hereafter referred to as the “flood map”) and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FBFM) and a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) (hereafter referred to as the “flood study”).

The areas of special flood hazard identified by FEMA in a scientific and engineering report entitled, “The Flood Insurance Study for Cache County, Utah and Incorporated Areas” dated May 24, 2011(which includes the City of Providence – Community Number 490226), with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FBFM) and any subsequent revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this Chapter.
This Chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Providence City.
10-16-3 Definitions
The following words and phrases shall be defined as follows for the purpose of this Chapter. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this Chapter its’ most reasonable application.

Area of future conditions – flood hazard: The land area that would be inundated by the 1-percent-annual-chance (100-year) flood based on future-conditions hydrology. 

Area of shallow flooding: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, OR VO zone on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a 1 percent or greater annual chance of flooding to and average depth of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

Area of special flood-related erosion hazard: The land within the City which is most likely to be subject to sever flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After the detailed evaluation of the special flood-related erosion hazard area in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further refined.

Area of special flood hazard: The land in the flood plain within the City subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated a Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map. Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V. For the purposes of these regulations, the term “special flood hazard area,’ is synonymous in meaning with the phrase “area of special flood hazard.”

Base flood: The flood having one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

Base flood elevation: The water surface elevation of the one percent annual chance flood. The height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of coastal and riverine areas.

Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

Breakaway wall: A wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
 
Building: See structure.

Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

Erosion: The process of the gradual wearing away of land masses. This peril is not per se covered under the Program.

Existing construction: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. “Existing construction” may also be referred to as “existing structures.”

Existing manufactured home park or subdivision: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the City.

Existing structures: See existing construction.

Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision: The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (A)(1) of this definition.
Flood elevation determination: A determination by the Federal Insurance Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.

Flood Insurance Study or Flood elevation study: An examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e. mudflow) and /or flood-related erosion hazards.

Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the Administrator has delineated both the special hazard area and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

Flood plain or flood-prone area: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”).

Flood proofing: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

Floodway: See regulatory floodway.

Floodway encroachment lines: The lines marking the limits of floodways on Federal, State and local flood plain maps.

Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. “Freeboard” tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
 
Functionally dependent use: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and uploading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

Highest adjacent grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

For floodplain management purposed, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

New manufactured home park or subdivision: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the City.

Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is:

Built on a single chassis;
400 Square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Regulatory floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

Special flood hazard area: See “area of special flood hazard.”

Special hazard area:	An area having special flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, AH, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M, or E.

Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)): Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filing; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 

Structure: For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Structure for insurance purposes, means:

A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site;
A manufactured home (“a manufactured home,” also known as a mobile home, is a structure: built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or
A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the City’s floodplain management and building ordinances or laws.

For the latter purpose, “structure” does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph (C) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage:	Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or
Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”
Variance: A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a flood plain management regulation.

Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in §60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Water surface elevation:	The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or riverine areas.

10-16-4 Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
In order to decrease flood loss, this Section includes methods and provisions for:

Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of channel flood waters;
Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may affect flood damage; and
Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
10-16-5 Permit Required
A building and/or development permit shall be required for all proposed construction and other developments including the placement of manufactured homes, within Zone A on the City’s FHBM or FIRM.

The permit shall be reviewed to:

Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and
Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
Determine, in the case of subdivision proposals and other proposed new development (including manufactured home parks or subdivisions), whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposal shall be reviewed to assured that:
All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area.
All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, storm water and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and
Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposures to flood hazards.
Require within flood-prone areas new and replacement water supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters in to the system.
Require within flood-prone areas:
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; and
Onsite waste disposal systems to be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
The Land Use Authority (made up of the Administrative Services Director, City Engineer, and Public Works Director) as defined by Title 2 Chapter 4 is hereby designated the Floodplain Manager to administer and implement the provisions of this Chapter; ensure that the City’s Records Officer maintains and holds open for public inspection a record of all records pertaining to the provisions of this Chapter; review permit application to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding; and review, approve or deny all applications for development remits required by this Chapter. Approval or denial of a Permit shall be based on all of the provisions of this Chapter and the following relevant factors:
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, storm water and water systems;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area.
Appeal Authority as defined by Title 2 Chapter 5 Procedures.
The Appeal Authority shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this Chapter; and appeals from a requirement, decision, or determination by the Floodplain Manager.
The Appeal Authority shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Manager in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter.
Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Authority may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
The Floodplain Manager shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to FEMA and the State Office of Emergency Management upon issuing a variance.
Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in D.2 of this Section have been fully considered. Variances may also be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on lots larger that one-half acre or more. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the Appeal Authority may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this Chapter (Section 1).
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result, or the Appeal Authority finds that refusing the variance would result in the taking or damaging of private property for a public purpose without the payment of just compensation.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Prerequisites for granting variances, in addition to the requirements for variances listed elsewhere in this Chapter.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, or is necessary to avoid the taking or damaging of private property for a public purpose without the payment of just compensation.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
Showing a good and sufficient cause;
Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
The criteria outlined in the above 1. – 9. are met, and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Application for a Permit shall be filed with the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by the City and may include, but not be limited to, plans drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of the proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required:
Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures.
Elevation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be flood-proofed.
A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential flood-proofed structure shall meet the flood-proofing criteria in Section 10-16-6: B.2.b of this Chapter.
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
10-16-6 Base Flood Elevation Data
All new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser shall include within such proposals base flood elevation data.
Base flood elevation and floodway data available from Federal, State, or other source, including data developed pursuant to A. above, shall be obtained, reviewed and reasonably utilized as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements or other development in Zone A on the City’s FHBM or FIRM to meet the following standards:
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE zones, and AH zones on the City’s FIRM shall be required to have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood level, unless the City is granted an exception by the Administrator for the allowance of basements in accordance with the appropriate sections of 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures with in Zones A1-30, AE, and AH zones on the City’s FIRM shall be required to:
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood level,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
All new construction and substantial improvements that have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalized hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the flowing minimum requirement:
A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,
In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or
In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement.
Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in and existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City’s FIRM that are not subject to d. above shall be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
It shall be required that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City’s FIRM either
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has not permanently attached additions), or
Meet the permit requirements of 10-16-4 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes” in d. above.
A regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood.
Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway shall be prohibited unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the City during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Where base flood elevation data are utilized within Zone A on the City’s FHBM or FIRM:
All new and substantially improved structures shall provide the elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement), and
If the structure has been flood-proofed in accordance with B.2.b above, the elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) to witch the structure was flood-proofed shall be provided.

Preparation: The preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with all requirements of the City and shall include all proposed phases.
Contents:
Drawing Requirements: The title block of the preliminary plat shall include the following:
The proposed name of the development.
The section, township and range of the development.
The names, addresses, and contact information of the owners, developer(s), if other than the owners, and surveyors or and designers of the development.
Scale of drawing and north arrow.
Existing Conditions: The preliminary plat shall also show:
The legal description basis of bearing, and total acreage (total acreage includes all property within the parcel(s) and all phases whether current or future) of the proposed development, certified by a licensed land surveyor.
Location, street number and name of existing streets within one hundred feet (100) of the development and of all previously platted streets or other public ways, railroad and utilities rights of way, parks and other public open spaces, permanent buildings and structures, and corporate lines within and adjacent to the tract.
The location of all wells, proposed, active and abandoned, springs, and all reservoirs within the tract and to a distance of at least one hundred feet (100') beyond the development boundaries.
Existing sewers, water mains, culverts or other underground facilities within the tract and to a distance of at least one hundred feet (100') beyond the tract boundaries, indicating pipe size, grades, manholes and accurate location.
Existing ditches, canals, natural drainage channels, open waterways, and proposed alignments or realignments within the tract and to a distance of at least one hundred feet (100') beyond the tract boundaries; and a letter, from the affected users indicating the plans are acceptable, must be submitted to the City.
Accurate boundary lines certified by a licensed land surveyor and ownership of adjacent parcels of land. (Subd. Ord., 1-24-1990)
By means of an overlay method or directly on the plat, vertical contour intervals of not more than two feet (2') or one foot (1') on predominantly level land.
A vicinity map shall show how the development is situated in its surrounding neighborhoods extending a minimum of two (2) blocks or more outward from the boundaries of the development. The vicinity map shall include all major, collector, standard and feeder streets within the area, both existing streets and those proposed on the Master Plan. (Subd. Ord., 1-24-1990; amd. Ord., 1-9-1996)
Proposed Conditions: The preliminary plat shall also show;

A professionally prepared plat having been prepared on a minimum twenty inch by thirty inch (20” x 30”) or maximum twenty-four inch by thirty-six inch (24” x 36”) approved reproducible drafting medium.
A signature block along the right-hand margin of the preliminary plat, providing for the following certifications or approvals:
Prior to City review, an affidavit or certificate of clear title to the effect that the applicant is the owner of, or that he is authorized by the owner in writing to make application for, the land proposed to be subdivided. The affidavit or certificate shall state clearly in which status, a copy of said written authorization from the owner shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. A title report shall also be submitted which indicates in whom the fee simple title to such property is vested and any liens or encumbrances thereon. A statement from the property owner disclosing any options or unrecorded contacts/agreements associated with the property.
Phasing. The development shall be phased to provide public infrastructure, facilities, and services in a timely and orderly manner and provide the City the ability to protect and promote public health, safety, and welfare.
When developing a large tract of land, developers may choose to construct the subdivision in phases rather than develop the entire property at once. However, in no case should a phase contain less than 6 lots; and no less than two acres of land area.
Phases shall be planned to ensure the efficient and consecutive construction of adjacent future phases (those phases immediately next to the subject phase, sharing a common boundary line), and to ensure that phased development does not allow for leapfrog development.
Each proposed phase shall provide no less than a proportionate share of required open space, recreation facilities, and/or dedications for public use concurrent with development. In cases where construction of a proportionate fair share improvement is not feasible or would result in incomplete facilities which do not mitigate the impacts of the phase, construction of the entire improvement may be required.
All phases shall be required to be stand-alone. No proposed prior phase shall be dependent on the completion of subsequent phases to be consistent with any required approvals and/or conditions, including but not limited to: the looping of roads and utilities; the provision of fire flow; and the mitigation of transportation, recreation and/or public services impacts. Landscaping and parking improvement shall be provided within each phase as required.
Infrastructure improvements which are required to serve the entire project may be constructed within a nonadjacent phase.
Phasing Plans shall include the following information:
Illustrative maps for each proposed phase which clearly mark in heavy lines the boundaries of the subject phase, label the phase alphabetically (to avoid confusion with lot numbers) and depict roads, lots, infrastructure, easements, dedications and open space which are included within the subject phase. The plan shall also illustrate those proposed improvements which mitigate impacts associated with the unbuilt portions of the project which are not located within the boundaries of the subject phase. Previously established phases, including roads, lots, infrastructure, easement, dedications, and open space, should be shown on the map shaded or gray-scaled. All phasing maps shall be drawn at the same scale.
A narrative description or table which describes each phase and its associated improvements, in addition, the narrative or table shall demonstrate that each phase would comprise a “stand-alone” development which, should no subsequent phases be constructed, would meet or exceed the standards of this title and all other conditions of approval. The narrative should also describe the proposed timeline for completion of the entire project and any proposals to bond for required unbuilt or yet-to-be-constructed improvements.
Choosing to phase the subdivision does not relieve developer of the requirement to present the entire subdivision in its phases, for final approval by the Planning Commission as required by Section 3 of this Title and Chapter.
Remainder parcel. In no case should a remainder parcel contain less area than the area required for 6 lots.
Submittal: Four (4) copies (20”x30” minimum , 24” x 36” maximum size) and one (1) 11" x 17" copy of the preliminary plat shall be submitted to the City for review a minimum of seven (7) days prior to the initial City review. The City will complete the first review within thirty (30) days. Each subsequent review is subject to an additional thirty (30) day review period. If all required information is not included, city has the right to refuse the package.
Staff Review: Upon review, the city executive staff will provide written comments, conclusions and recommendations to the Land Use Authority. (Subd. Ord., 1-24-1990; amd. Ord., 1-9-1996)
Approval: No preliminary plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission, the City Council, or any other designated Land Use Authority unless it complies with or can be shown that a final plat will be likely to comply with all the provisions set forth in the Providence City Ordinances. No preliminary or final plat shall be approved if a commitment-of-service letter has not been issued for the plat pursuant to Section 8-1-21.
A preliminary plat is not considered approved until all conditions have been satisfied and the plat has been signed by the City Engineer, Land Use Authority, and the Developer.
Complete application: Providence City has thirty (30) days to review an application for completeness. At that time the City will provide a written notice of acceptance or denial to the developer and/or their agent. If the application is denied, the application fee may be refunded; professional fees for review may be billed. To be considered complete, an application must contain the following:
a completed Providence City Application Form;
payment of the application fee;
the proposed preliminary plat and all required copies;
a title report shall also be submitted which indicates in whom the fee simple title to such property is vested and any liens or encumbrances thereon;
a copy of the City’s written approval of the concept plan.
Expiration:

The City, at its sole discretion, may restrict driveway location for lots adjacent to streets with temporary ends.
The City, at its sole discretion, may require an easement for snow removal at a temporary end to a street.
Exception to hot mix asphalt. If the grade in a temporary turnaround is 2% or less, a hard surface other than hot mix asphalt may be accepted. However, the grade of the temporary turnaround must be designed with safety in mind. The City reserves the right to reject a temporary turnaround at a grade of 2% or less, if the City Engineer feels safety may be compromised.
Park Strips: Park strips shall be at least seven feet (7’) in width.
Bicycle Lanes: On major, commercial, and residential streets, bicycle lanes should be added as specified in the General Plan and/or Transportation Corridor Master Plan, and other streets where possible.

Parking: Parking on major, commercial, or specified residential street, as shown on the General Plan and/or Transportation Corridor Master Plan, should be limited to areas designated by Providence City, so as not to impede the flow of traffic.
Seal Coat on Asphalt Surfaces: Provisions for sealing all asphalt surfaces within the subdivision shall be determined during the subdivision development plan approval process. Developers may seal asphalt using one of the following methods:
Ancillary Agreement. The developer may enter into an ancillary agreement with the City in which the developer provides to the City a predetermined guarantee for improvements in exchange for the City agreeing that the developer will seal all asphalt within the subdivision no later than two (2) years after the completion of the subdivision and by a date agreed to by the City Engineer; or
Seal Coat Fee. The developer may pay a seal coat fee to the City, and the City will seal all asphalt in the subdivision. The seal coat fee shall be equal to the square footage of road surfaces in the subdivision multiplied by the cost per square foot for the type of seal coat to be used. The fee per square foot shall be set by resolution of the City Council in the Master Fee Schedule and modified as needed from time to time. Pursuant to either seal option stated above, the City’s Streets Superintendant shall determine the type of seal coat to be used (chip seal, slurry seal, etc.) based on “best practice” for the type of street to be sealed. If a developer selects the seal coat fee option, the use of the fees collected for the actual application of the approved seal coat shall be at the discretion of the City as determined by the City’s municipal budget. The seal coat fee shall be used by the City to accomplish the initial seal coating for the subdivision no later than two (2) years after the completion of the subdivision.

(Subd. Ord., 1-24-1990)

11-5-14 Sharing Development Costs
Public works improvements shall be paid for by the developers and land owners who will benefit by their existence and use as set forth in this Section.

Compensation: Circumstances where the original developer may be compensated by adjacent land owners or by the City for a portion of the cost for these improvements:
Adjacent Land Owner: The owner of any parcel of land that has frontage along and/or is immediately adjacent to any public works improvements, which land owner would benefit from connecting onto or accessing the public works improvements without additional easements or right of ways. Parcels of land that could only be served by an extension of the public improvements beyond the end of those that were installed by the original developer are not included.
City Compensation: The City may use Providence City Code 11-5-11 as a guide for determining whether or not to assist a developer where the potential for future growth may present a demand for up-sized water or sewer lines or extra width for a road.
In addition to 11-5-11, the City may provide funds from impact fees or sales tax rebate incentives that would expand and improve public works in already existing public rights of way, or in areas where upgrades are needed but not done, provided the use of impact fees is in compliance with State and City law.
The City may use impact fees to assist with off-site improvements as allowed by law so that reimbursement to the developer will not have to be tracked in the future.
All agreements and the dollar amounts of the financial commitment by the City must be part of the development agreement.
When the City participates with a developer as herein mentioned, then there will be no additional compensation due from adjacent land owners to the developer.
In the event the City determines to participate in the costs of certain public works improvements proposed by a developer, the City’s participation will generally involve the expenditure of impact fees as allowed by law, in the anticipation that the City will be reimbursed through the collection of impact fees at the time building permits are issued as development occurs and/or through receipt of sales tax revenues.
Compensation from adjacent land owners: Where an adjacent land owner may benefit from the installation of public works improvements, a developer may contact the adjacent land owner and solicit participation in the costs for such improvements from the adjacent land owner(s).
If an agreement is reached, a written agreement for sharing development costs by adjacent landowners that may use the improvements shall be submitted by the developer initially responsible for the improvements, along with the final plat.
No participation from adjacent land owners: Where adjacent land owners do not participate as described in C. above, and the City does not participate as described in B. City Compensation, above, then the original developer may be entitled to compensation from adjacent land owners as follows:
Submitting a statement of costs: The original developer must file a letter or other written notice with the City by not later than the date of final plat approval by the City Council, indicating the original developer’s intent to be considered for reimbursement of a portion of the costs of constructing public works improvements as provided in this ordinance.
The letter or other written notice must provide an estimate of costs for the public works improvements to be installed by the Developer.
This letter or other written notice will be used by the City to alert future adjacent land owners or their developers of their responsibility to the original developer, if they should begin to develop their adjacent real property before the original developer has completed installation of the required public works improvements.
The failure to submit the referenced letter or other written notice to the City by the date of final plat approval by the City Council shall constitute a wavier by the original developer of the right to request reimbursement as contemplated by this section.
No developer may use this ordinance for shared development costs as a basis for unapproved private compensation or to control, direct, or deter growth within the City.
The City requires that all compensation of one developer to another be accomplished by using this ordinance and be done in writing and in conjunction with the City.
Developers may continue, however, to combine their resources and work together in developing areas or a combination of areas, as proposals are made, as described in paragraph 3 above.
Completion
When the original development’s public improvements are completed and accepted in writing by the City, the original developer has 30 days from the date of acceptance of said improvement by the City, to file a statement of actual expenses incurred for the public works improvements.
Itemize each item of the public improvements, with complete itemization of the costs incurred for each item. Statement may include engineering costs. Statement shall include developer’s proposed division of such costs between the developer and adjacent landowners.
Should the original developer fail to file the statement of actual expenses incurred for the public works improvements as required by this subsection 2, within 30 days from the date of acceptance of the public works improvements by the City, or fail to submit the as-built drawings as required by the City’s subdivision ordinance, the original developer’s request for compensation/reimbursement and any determination made by the commission and/or the City Council shall become null and void.
Future Development: Pro-rata Share: Future development by owners of land adjacent to these public improvements will not be approved by the City until the new developer agrees in writing to compensate the original developer, or the developer’s legal agent, for a pro-rata share of the costs of the public works improvements, as was approved by the City.
Reimbursement to the Original Developer: Reimbursement to the original developer shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the pro-rata share during the first five (5) years following the date of completion and acceptance by the City of the public works improvements. The pro-rata share shall be depreciated twenty percent (20%) per year thereafter, and no pro rata share shall be due to the developer after ten (10) years following the acceptance date by the City.
