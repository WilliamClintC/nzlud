Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) before a parade can be
conducted on a state-maintained road. In that case, authorization must be
obtained from VDOT and the Town Council, pursuant to this chapter.16

All temporary food establishments in the Town of Hillsville, Virginia, shall
comply with the temporary event food facility policy of the Virginia
Department of Health and also be required to do the following:
A. In addition to overhead covering, all temporary food establishments
serving foods requiring temperature control for safety, otherwise
known as TCS foods (i.e., chicken, beef, seafood, shell eggs, dairy,
cooked fruits or vegetables, cut tomatoes, cut melons, etc.), shall have
cooking and preparation areas protected with sneeze guards or be
separated by at least 30 inches from the general public. The serving

inches off the ground or in waterproof, covered storage containers.
C. All temporary food establishments shall have all food contact surfaces

food preparation. All non-food-contact surfaces shall be easily
cleanable. All screens, tent and canopy materials shall remain clean
during the duration of the event.
D. Due to the insufficient capability of charcoal briquettes to maintain
properly controlled cooking temperatures, no preparation of TCS foods,
such as beef, pork, fish and poultry, shall be performed using charcoaltype
grills and cookers. Alternative methods for cooking include electric
and propane gas cooking equipment.
E. For festivals or events of more than two days' duration, any food vendor
handling, preparing or holding for sale to the public foods requiring
temperature control (TCS foods) shall have working electric freezer
equipment to properly store frozen foods so that they remain frozen
solid and working electric refrigeration that will consistently hold TCS
foods at 41°F or lower.
F. Any vendor selling food to the public shall submit a completed
application for a temporary food establishment permit and the
§ 132-8 HILLSVILLE CODE § 132-9
108:100
appropriate fee to the Carroll County Health Department for each
temporary food establishment location. All applications and fees shall
be submitted no later 10 days prior to the event. Late applications or
incomplete applications will not be processed.
G. All temporary food vendors shall have a person in charge (PIC) that is
on site, for each location, who demonstrates food safety knowledge by
holding a current and valid food protection manager certification or, at
minimum, showing proof of having completed a food handler training
course within the past three years from an accredited program
accepted by the Carroll County Health Department. If a vendor has
more than one location, each location shall have a separate PIC meeting
this requirement. A copy of the certificate or proof of training shall
accompany the application submission 10 calendar days before
proposed opening. The only exception will be for temporary food

their application 10 days before proposed opening.

for arrival, set up, and inspection prior to their anticipated opening.

and issuing permits at least one day before food service is allowed at
the event.

a different day. The exception to this would be if the food vendor can
demonstrate approved food safety procedures to the local Health
Department by submitting a hazard analysis critical control point
(HACCP) plan 10 calendar days before proposed opening for approval.
J. All temporary food vendors shall provide customers access to a
handwashing area or hand sanitizer within 50 feet of their register.

statute shall not apply to:

by any political subdivision of the state or by any charitable
nonprofit organization [501c(3)] or group thereof; and
(2) Concession stands at youth athletic facilities or activities, if such
stands are promoted or sponsored by either a political subdivision
of the state; by an applicable youth athletic association; by a
volunteer fire department or rescue squad; or by any charitable
nonprofit organization or group thereof which has been recognized
as being a part of a recreational program of the county and wherein

resolution of the county; and
(3) All those properly exempted from the provisions of the Code of
Virginia § 35.1-14 or any successor statute, except as provided in
this section, shall rely on the Virginia Department of Health to
provide advice, consultation and expertise in the realm of food
preparation and service activities for the purpose of ensuring the
public's health, safety, and welfare.
L. Supervision of food sales as contemplated in this section shall be made
by the Health Officer of the Town or a qualified person designated by
such officer. Such supervision shall include:
(1) A requirement of notice from the food concessionaire as to the time
and place of the sale of food;
(2) Meetings as necessary with the representatives of such
organizations to provide information and assistance, where
necessary, to provide a healthy environment for the sale of food;
(3) Inspections, as necessary, to determine if such operations are being
conducted in a healthy environment and to provide assistance in
remediation, if necessary;
(4) Inspections, as necessary, to determine if the authorized
organizations are operating such food concessions; and
(5) No other supervision unless directed by future ordinance of the
Town Council.
A. Any vendor, owner, manager or person in charge of a vendor's stand
violating any provisions of a special events sales ordinance shall be
guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
B. Any property owner, tenant, manager, custodian or other person in
charge of the property, after notification by the Chief of Police or an
officer designated by him who allows a vendor to remain upon his
property in violation of any of the special events sales ordinances shall
be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
C. There will be a penalty of $100 for any vendor who begins selling prior
to obtaining and posting the required vendors license. [Added
3-13-2017]
D. Licenses not returned to Town Hall by the specified date will be
assessed a late penalty of $50 per person. [Added 3-13-2017]

Purpose
§ 140-3. General purpose.
The general purpose of this chapter is to establish certain subdivision
standards and procedures for the Town of Hillsville, Virginia. It is part
of a long-range plan to guide and facilitate the orderly beneficial growth
of the community and to promote the public safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity and general welfare. There standards and procedures can
provide a guide for the change that occurs when lands and acreage become
urban in character as a result of residential, commercial or industrial
development and can make possible the provision of public services in
a safe, adequate and efficient manner. Subdivided land sooner or later
becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be
maintained and numerous public services customary to urbanized areas
must be provided. This chapter assists the community in meeting these
responsibilities.
§ 140-4. Specific purposes.
More specifically, the regulations included herein are designed to bring
about the coordination of streets within subdivisions with other existing and
planned streets; to provide for the safe and efficient circulation of traffic; to
avoid hazardous intersections and other dangerous conditions; to provide
adequate drainage and water and sewer systems; to establish construction
standards for streets and other improvements; to lessen flood damage and
to control erosion and sedimentation; to ensure that land is platted and
developed in a way that is consonant with the efficient and economic use
of public funds; to require the proper legal description and monumenting
of subdivided land; and to assure that the purchasers of lots are offered a
commodity that is suitable for development and use.

Design Standards
§ 140-31. General principles.
The subdivider shall observe the following general requirements and
principles of land subdivision:
§ 140-32. Street layout and construction.
In the layout of streets, the subdivider shall comply with the following:
A. Suitability of land. Land which the Planning Commission determines to
be unsuitable for development because of vulnerability to flooding, poor
drainage or the characteristics likely to be harmful to the safety,
welfare or health of the future residents or to the public shall not be
submitted unless adequate methods to correct all such hazards are
devised and approved by the Planning Commission.
B. Conformity with official plans. All proposed subdivisions shall conform
to any adopted plans for the town and shall be in accord with planning
policies of the town and the county. The subdivider shall make available
for public acquisition such lands in the area to be subdivided as are
designated by official plans for parks, playgrounds and schools or other
public buildings. Whenever said area includes any part of a major
arterial or collector street as designated on an official plan, appropriate
provision for the right-of-way thereof shall be incorporated in the
subdivision plat.
C. Preservation of natural features. In the design of any subdivision,
careful consideration will be given to preserving natural features and
amenities and to the preservation of sites and buildings having historic
value.
D. Private streets prohibited. There shall be no private streets platted in
any subdivision. Each lot shall have direct frontage on and access to a
dedicated public street.
E. Large tracts. Where land is subdivided into larger parcels than normal
building lots, such parcels shall be arranged in such a way that future
resubdivision is feasible.
F. Neighborhood consideration. Street and block layout shall be made
with consideration of the most advantageous development of adjoining
tracts and the entire neighborhood.
G. Advertising standards. A subdivider when advertising a subdivided
tract of land for sale shall be specific as to the following items, whether
officially approved water and sewage facilities are available or not.
§ 140-31 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 140-32
136:131
A. Streets shall be coordinated with the existing street system and
provision shall be made for continuity of principal streets as
appropriate.
B. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable to
provide for future street access to adjoining unsubdivided property,
proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary of such property.
Where one (1) or more lots front on any such street extension, a
temporary turnaround shall be provided.
C. Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged.
D. All dead-end streets or culs-de-sac shall terminate in a turnaround
having a minimum right-of-way diameter of one hundred (100) feet.
E. Less than full-width streets shall not be permitted, and boundary
streets along the edge of the tract shall not be permitted unless
required to provide right-of-way for streets and arterials designated by
an official major street plan.
F. Where land in a proposed subdivision is adjacent to a major arterial
highway, the Planning Commission may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access
reservation along the rear property line or such other treatment as may
be necessary for protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
G. Alleys may be required at the rear of lots used for commercial and
industrial purposes. In general, alleys shall not be platted in residential
blocks unless the need for them can be demonstrated to the Planning
Commission.

Improvements shall be provided as follows:
§ 140-38. Performance bond.
The cost of all improvements required by the provisions of this section shall
be paid by the subdivider, or as much thereof as the Council shall direct. If
the actual installation of improvements is not completed prior to the filing
of an application for final plat approval, the subdivider shall execute an
agreement and post a bond with surety or other guarantee satisfaction to

allow for inflationary cost increases.
A. Streets. Streets shall be graded to the full width and in conformance
with the approved cross sections and profiles. The pavement base and
surface shall be appropriate to the type of development and use
contemplated. All streets shall be constructed in accordance with

ARTICLE XI
Variances and Modifications
§ 140-39. Planned unit development.
The design requirements of this chapter may be modified in the case of a
planned unit development, upon determination by the Planning Commission
that the proposed development will provide adequate public spaces and
fully meet needs for light, air, service, circulation, recreation and livability.
Before approval of any such planned unit development, a detailed site plan
shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
provision shall be made for such covenants and other legal provisions as will
ensure that the plan will be carried out.
§ 140-40. Variances.
Where, because of unusual topographical conditions peculiar to the site
or because of unusual shape of the property, the Planning Commission
finds that strict adherence to the requirements of this chapter would result
in extraordinary hardship to the subdivider or builder, including but not
limited to summer homes or vacation cottages built on mountainous or
rough terrain, it may permit a variance in the regulations so that substantial
justice is done and the public interest secured, provided that the granting
of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship as
distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the
subdivider; and, provided, further, that such variance will not have the
effect of nullifying the intent of this chapter.
§ 140-41. Conditions.
In granting variance and modifications, the Planning Commission may
impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.

a peddler or itinerant merchant.

ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.
When one or more of the includable corporations, including the
common parent corporation is a nonstock corporation, the term "stock,"

(1) Such person maintains a definite place of business in this
jurisdiction;
(2) Such person does not maintain a definite office anywhere but does

(3) There is no definite place of business, but such person operates

merchant, carnival or circus as specified in §§ 58.1-3717, 3718 or
3728, respectively, of the Code of Virginia, or is a contractor
subject to § 58.1-3715 of the Code of Virginia, or is a public service
corporation subject to § 58.1-3731 of the Code of Virginia.
B. A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business.
A person engaged in two or more businesses or professions carried on
at the same place of business may elect to obtain one license for all such
businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are satisfied:
(1) Each business or profession is licensable at the location and has
satisfied any requirements imposed by state law or other provisions
of the ordinances of the Town of Hillsville;
§ 144-43 TATTOO PARLORS § 144-44
142:181
(2) All of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax rate
or, if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed
on all businesses and professions at the highest rate; and
(3) The taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the Assessor
may require concerning the nature of the several businesses and
their gross receipts.
C. Each person subject to a license tax shall apply for a license prior to
beginning business, if he was not subject to licensing in this jurisdiction
on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than March 1 of
the current license year if he had been issued a license for the
preceding license year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by
the assessing official.
D. The tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any license not
based on gross receipts. If the tax is measured by the gross receipts of
the business, the tax shall be paid on or before May 1.
E. The assessing official may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 90
days, in which to file an application for a license, for reasonable cause.
The extension shall be conditioned upon the timely payment of a
reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the
correct tax at the end of the extension, together with interest from the
due date until the date paid, and, if the estimate submitted with the
extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a
penalty of 10% of the portion paid after the due date.
F. A penalty of 10% of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an
application or the failure to pay the tax by the appropriate due date.
Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the assessing official if
both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties may
be assessed if the assessing official determines that the taxpayer has a
history of noncompliance. In the case of an assessment of additional tax
made by the assessing official, if the application and, if applicable, the
return were made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was
not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the
taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the
additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the assessing official is not
paid within 30 days, the Treasurer (or other collecting official) may
impose late payment penalty of 10%. The penalties shall not be imposed
or, if imposed, shall be abated by the official who assessed them if the
failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to
demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted
responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control.
(1) "Acted responsibly" means that the taxpayer exercised the level of
reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the
circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business
and the taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate
the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where
§ 144-44 HILLSVILLE CODE § 144-44
142:182
§ 144-45. Situs of gross receipts.
applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment,
acting to remove an impediment once it occurred and promptly
rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure
discovered.
(2) "Events beyond the taxpayer's control" include, but are not limited
to, the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the
unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the
person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the
taxpayer's reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous
written information from the assessing official, who was aware of
the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he
provided the erroneous information.
G. Interest.
(1) Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the
due date until the date paid without regard to fault or other reason
for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or
omitted tax by the assessing official is found to be erroneous, all
interest and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the
assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded, together with
interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date,
whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any tax
paid under this article from the date of payment or due date,
whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or
other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at the same rate
charged under § 58.1-3916.
(2) No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability
to actual liability at the conclusion of a base year. No interest shall
be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, in event of such
adjustment, provided that the refund or the late payment is made
not more than 30 days from the date of the payment that created
the refund or the due date of the tax, whichever is later.
H. Requirement for payment of Town taxes. Sufficient evidence must be
presented that all delinquent Town business license, real estate,
personal property, meals, transient occupancy, or other applicable taxes
and fees must be paid prior to issuance of a business license as
provided by § 58.1-3700 of the Code of Virginia [Added 6-27-2016]
A. General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this article is measured by
gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall
be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable
privilege at a definite place of business within this jurisdiction. In the
case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such
as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be
attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities
§ 144-44 TATTOO PARLORS § 144-45
142:183
are initiated, directed or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for
different classifications of business shall be attributed to one or more
definite places of business or offices as follows:
(1) The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite
place of business at which his services are performed or, if his
services are not performed at any definite place of business, then
the definite place of business from which his services are directed
or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of
§ 58.1-3715 of the Code of Virginia.
(2) The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to
the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities
occur or, if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite
place of business, then the definite place of business from which
sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a
wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured
by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the
definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the
purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers.
Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or more
localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the
localities use different measures may apply to the Department of
Taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases
and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality.
(3) The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property
shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the
tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented
from any definite place of business, then the definite place of
business at which the rental of such property is managed.
(4) The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be
attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are
performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business,
then the definite place of business from which the services are
directed or controlled.
B. Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of
business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which
definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the
general rule (and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an
apportionment agreement), except as to circumstances set forth in
§ 58.1-3709 of the Code of Virginia, the gross receipts of the business
shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the
basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite
place of business unless some activities under the applicable general
rule occurred at or were controlled from such definite place of business.
Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another
jurisdiction shall not be attributed to this jurisdiction solely because the
§ 144-45 HILLSVILLE CODE § 144-45
142:184
§ 144-46. Limitations and extensions.
§ 144-47. Appeals and rulings.
other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts
attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction.
C. Agreements. The Assessor may enter into agreements with any other
political subdivision of Virginia concerning the manner in which gross
receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business.
However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement
shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the
definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being
notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is
fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one or more political
subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and
that the difference has or is likely to result in taxes on more than 100%
of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the
Assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment
agreement with the other political subdivisions involved.
A. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment
of any license tax imposed pursuant to this article, both the assessing
official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment
after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the
expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may
be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the
expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
B. Notwithstanding § 58.1-3903 of the Code of Virginia, the assessing
official shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or
failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six
preceding years. (Note that this applies to only 1997 and later. Prior to
1997 is current plus three preceding years.)
C. The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to
the period specified in § 58.1-3940 of the Code of Virginia, two years
after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been
extended pursuant to this section, two years after the final
determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed
pursuant to the following § 144-47B or D of this article or two years
after the final decision in a court application pursuant to § 58.1-3984 of
the Code of Virginia or similar law for which collection has been stayed,
whichever is later.
A. Any person assessed with a licensing tax under this article as the result
of an audit may apply, within 90 days from the date of the assessment,
to the assessing official for a correction of the assessment. The
application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the
taxpayer, audit period, remedy sought, each alleged error in the
assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies and any other
§ 144-45 TATTOO PARLORS § 144-47
142:185
facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The Assessor may hold a
conference with the taxpayer, if requested by the taxpayer, or require
submission of additional information and documents, further audit or
other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable
determination of the applications. The assessment shall be deemed
prima facie correct. The Assessor shall undertake a full review of the
taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the taxpayer setting
forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an audit shall be
accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek
correction and the specific procedure to be followed in the jurisdiction
(e.g., the name and address to which an application should be directed).
B. Provided that an application is made within 90 days of an assessment,
collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination is
issued by the Assessor, unless the Assessor determines that collection
would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to
a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall
accrue in accordance with the provisions of § 144-44G of this article,
but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is
suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the
application is frivolous or that a taxpayer desires to depart quickly from
the locality; to remove his property therefrom; to conceal himself or his
property therein; or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to
render wholly or partially ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax for
the period in question.
C. Any person assessed with a license tax under this article as a result of
an audit may apply within 90 days of the determination by the assessing
official on an application pursuant to Subsection A above to the Tax
Commissioner for a correction of such assessment. The Tax
Commissioner shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90
days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and
the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required.
The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to
§ 58.1-1821 of the Code of Virginia, and the Tax Commissioner may
issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to § 58.1-1822 of
the Code of Virginia. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the
assessing official may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to
§ 58.1-3984 of the Code of Virginia. However, the burden shall be on the
party making the application to show that the ruling of the Tax
Commissioner is erroneous. Neither the Tax Commissioner nor the
Department of Taxation shall be made a party to an application to
correct an assessment merely because the Tax Commissioner has ruled
on it.
D. On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the Tax Commissioner
under Subsection C above, the assessing official shall further suspend
collection activity until a final determination is issued by the Tax
Commissioner, unless the Assessor determines that collection would be
jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a
§ 144-47 HILLSVILLE CODE § 144-47
142:186
§ 144-48. Recordkeeping and audits.
Every person who is assessable with a license tax shall keep sufficient
records to enable the Assessor to verify the correctness of the tax paid
for the license years assessable and to enable the assessor to ascertain
what is the correct amount of tax that was assessable for each of those
years. All such records, books of accounts and other information shall be
open to inspection and examination by the Assessor in order to allow the
Assessor to establish whether a particular receipt is directly attributable to
the taxable privilege exercised within this jurisdiction. The Assessor shall
provide the taxpayer with the option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's
local business office, if the records are maintained there. In the event the
records are maintained outside this jurisdiction, copies of the appropriate
books and records shall be sent to the Assessor's office upon demand.
§ 144-49. Exclusions and deductions from gross receipts.
request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall
accrue in accordance with the provisions of § 144-44G, but no further
penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term
"jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in
Subsection B above.
E. Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of
the tax to a specific situation from the Assessor. Any person requesting
such a ruling must provide all the relevant facts for the situation and
may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law
most favorable to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the
applicable law or the factual situation as presented in the ruling request
shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A written ruling may be revoked
or amended prospectively if there is a change in the law, a court
decision or the Assessor notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy
or interpretation upon which the ruling was based. However, any
person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall
be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such
ruling was in effect.
A. General rule. Gross receipts for license tax purposes shall not include
any amount not derived from the exercise of the licensed privilege to
engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of business or
profession.
B. The following items shall be excluded from gross receipts:
(1) Amounts received and paid to the United States, the
commonwealth or any county, city or town for the Virginia retail
sales or use tax or for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on
cigarettes or for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels.
(2) Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of
another asset to the extent that the amount is attributable to a
§ 144-47 TATTOO PARLORS § 144-49
142:187
transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts
receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable
receipts even though the creation of such debt and factoring are a
regular part of its business) .
(3) Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the
business to its customer.
(4) Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the
licensee is the obligor.
(5) Receipts representing the return of principal of a loan transaction
in which the licensee is the creditor or the return of principal or
basis upon the sale of a capital asset.
(6) Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases
by the licensee. A rebate or other incentive offered to induce the
recipient to purchase certain goods or services from a person other
than the offeror and which the recipient assigns to the licensee in
consideration of the sale of goods and services shall not be
considered a rebate or discount to the licensee, but shall be
included in the licensee's gross receipts, together with any
handling or other fees related to the incentive.
(7) Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or
distribution and for which no consideration is received and the
occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory, whether
or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes.
(8) Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by
a licensable business not classified as rendering financial services.
This exclusion shall apply to interest on bank accounts of the
business and to interest, dividends and other income derived from
the investment of its own funds in securities and other types of
investments unrelated to the licensed privilege. This exclusion shall
not apply to interest, late fees and similar income attributable to an
installment sale or other transaction that occurred in the regular
course of business.
C. The following shall be deducted from gross receipts or gross purchases
that would otherwise be taxable;
(1) Any amount paid for computer hardware and software that is sold
to a United States federal or state government entity, provided that
such property was purchased within two years of the sale to said
entity by the original purchaser who shall have been contractually
obligated at the time of purchase to resell such property to a state
or federal government entity. This deduction shall not occur until
the time of resale and shall apply to only the original cost of the
property and not to its resale price, and the deduction shall not
apply to any of the tangible personal property which was the
subject of the original resale contract if it is not resold to a state or

request for a deferred payment plan.
(3) A residential customer who is currently making installment and
surcharge payments under a prior deferred payment plan.

D. Upon receipt of an untimely request or a request from an ineligible
residential customer, the Town shall mail to the customer a notice of his
ineligibility or of the untimeliness of his request. The Town shall then
proceed as if the customer had not made the request.

such installment due 30 days after payment of the initial payment.

added following payment of the initial payment or an installment

be excluded from water and sewer connection fees with the
stipulation that payment is made in full and the connection made
within one year from the time of application. [Amended
6-8-1988]
G. When a payment by a residential customer is not sufficient to satisfy an
installment and surcharge payable under the customer's deferred
payment plan and a currently payable utility charge, the payment shall
first be applied to the installment and surcharge and then to the
currently payable utility charge.

§ 153-8. Customer disputes.

the establishment of a deferred payment plan, for reasons other than
the untimeliness of the request or the ineligibility of the customer, the
Town shall mail to the customer a notice of rejection stating the
following:
(1) The reason(s) that the customer's request was rejected;
(2) The date of the notice of rejection; and
(3) The date that complete payment of the utility charge is due at the
Town, which shall be the payment date shown on the utility bill, or
the date of termination shown on the notice of termination or five
days after the date of the notice of rejection, whichever is latest.
I. If payment has not been received by the date specified on the Deferred
Payment Plan Application, utility service will be terminated. Complete
payment of the amount which prompted the termination, plus a
reconnection fee of $75, must be remitted to the Town before services
can be reinstated. [Added 6-22-1992; amended 6-26-2000]
A. At any time before the date of termination of utility service for
nonpayment of the amount(s) shown on a utility bill, a notice of
rejection or a notice of termination, a customer may dispute the
correctness of all or part of the amount(s) shown in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. A customer shall not be entitled to dispute
the correctness of all or part of the amount if all or part of the amount
was the subject of a previous dispute under this section.
B. The procedure for customer disputes shall be as follows:
(1) Before the date of termination, the customer shall notify the Town,
in writing, that he disputes all or part of the amount shown on a
utility bill, a notice of rejection or a notice of termination, stating as
completely as possible the basis for the dispute.
(2) If the Town determines that the present dispute is untimely or that
the customer previously disputed the correctness of all or part of
the amount shown, the Town shall mail to the customer a notice
stating that the present dispute is untimely or invalid. The Town
shall then proceed as if the customer had not notified the Town of
the present dispute.
(3) If the Town determines that the present dispute is not untimely or
invalid under this section, the Town, within three days after the
receipt of the customer's notice, shall arrange an informal meeting
between the customer and the Town Manager.
(4) Based on the Town's records, the customer's allegations and all
other relevant materials available to the Manager, the Manager
§ 153-7 TATTOO PARLORS § 153-8
142:195
shall resolve the dispute, attempting to do so in a manner
satisfactory to both the Town and the customer.
(5) Within five days of completion of the meeting, the Manager shall
mail to the customer a copy of his decision resolving the dispute.
(6) If the decision is unsatisfactory to the customer, the customer
within five days of his receipt of the Manager's decision, may
request, in writing, a formal hearing before the Town Council.
(7) The formal hearing before the Town Council shall be held within 10
days of the Town's receipt of the customer's written request.
(8) At the hearing, the Town and the customer shall be entitled to
present all evidence that is relevant and material to the dispute and
to examine and cross-examine witnesses. A tape-recorded (or at the
option of the Town, a stenographic) record of the hearing shall be
maintained.
(9) Based on the record established at hearing, the Town Council,
within five days of the completion of hearing, shall issue a written
decision formally resolving the dispute. This decision shall be final
and binding on the Town and the customer and shall be the decision
of the majority of the Council. The Mayor shall write the decision.
C. Utilization of this dispute procedure shall not relieve a customer of his
obligation to pay all other undisputed utility charges and/or
installments and surcharges and the undisputed portion(s) of the
amount(s) which is the subject of the present dispute, timely and
completely, notwithstanding § 153-8.
D. Failure to pay all such undisputed amounts timely and completely shall
subject the customer to termination of utility service in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
E. Until the date of the Town Council's or Town Manager's decision,
whichever is later, the Town shall not terminate the utility service of
this residential customer and shall not issue a notice of termination to
him solely for nonpayment of the disputed amount(s). If it is determined
that the customer must pay some or all of the disputed amount(s), the
Town shall promptly mail to or personally serve upon the customer a
notice of termination, which shall contain the following.
(1) The amount to be paid.
(2) The date of the notice of termination.
(3) The date of termination, which shall be at least 15 days after the
date of the notice of termination.
(4) Notice that, unless the Town receives complete payment of the
amount shown prior to the date of termination, utility service shall
be terminated.

be terminated.
(5) Notice that further information is available at the Town office upon
request.
D. If, prior to the date of termination, the Town has not received complete
payment of the amount shown on the notice of termination; the
residential customer has not requested the establishment of a deferred
payment plan; or the customer has not notified the Town that he
disputes the correctness of all or part of the amount shown on the
notice of termination, then the Town shall terminate utility service
provided to the customer on the date of termination.
E. If the Town receives payment of the entire amount shown on the notice
of termination prior to the date of termination, such payment shall be
considered a timely and complete payment for purposes of this chapter.

unless reinstatement has been authorized by the Town, shall be prima
facie evidence of an intent to violate this section by the person to whose
benefit it is that such service is restored and shall be punishable by a
fine of $50. If payment is not made within 72 hours, this will be
classified as a Class 1 misdemeanor and legal action will be taken. The
person will, in addition to the fine, be responsible for paying all court
costs. [Amended 6-22-1992]
B. In addition, unauthorized reconnection of a utility as defined shall
result in a utility bill to be charged by the Town to the utility user in

pursuant to § 153-11. In the case of landlord-tenant relationships, the
following procedures will apply in regards to the billing: [Added

contacting the Town for utility services and payment of charges,
including unauthorized usage charges as herein defined.
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the landowner/landlord to notify the
Town of incoming tenants. Failure to so notify the Town shall result
in landowner/landlord liability as to the unauthorized utility usage
charges as herein defined, plus a reconnection fee of $75.
Unauthorized utility usage charges shall be defined as charges for
water and/or sewer used if the meter is turned on by anyone other
than authorized Town personnel. If payment is not made within 20

mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Town shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste
stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3) A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered
by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4) A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
B. State pretreatment standards.
(1) State requirements and limitations on pretreatment discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this article.
(2) The state standards and limitations shall apply in any case where
they are more stringent than the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards.

discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges
to the POTW.
§ 167-30. Dilution.
No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The Town may impose mass limitations on industrial users
which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
§ 167-31. Protection of capacity for existing users.
The Town shall not issue a permit for any connection to the Town's
treatment works or treatment facilities unless there is sufficient capacity,
not legally committed to other users, in the treatment works and treatment
facilities to adequately treat the quantity of wastewater for the requested
connection. The Town may permit such a connection if there are legally
binding commitments to the needed capacity.
§ 167-31.1. Pretreatment facilities.

plans describing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the Town for review and shall be acceptable to the Town
before construction of the facilities. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to
the Town under the provisions of this article.
§ 167-31.2. Additional pretreatment measures.
§ 167-31.3. Accidental discharge/slug control plans.
At least once every two years, the Town shall evaluate whether each user
needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Town may require
any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the Town may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Town may require industrial users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams and such other conditions as may be necessary
to protect the POTW and determine the industrial user's compliance
with the requirements of this article.

When the Town finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town
may serve upon said user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of
the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Town. Submission of this plan
in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occur before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Town to take any action, including emergency actions or
any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
§ 167-31.38. Consent orders.
The Town may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period also specified by the document. Such documents shall have
the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant
to §§ 167-31.40 and 167-31.41 of this article and shall be judicially
enforceable.
§ 167-31.39. Show cause hearing.
The Town may order a user which has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear
before the Town and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not
be a bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
§ 167-31.40. Compliance orders.
When the Town finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town

not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may
also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize
the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any
other action against the user.
§ 167-31.41. Cease and desist orders.
§ 167-31.42. Administrative fines.
A. When the Town finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Town may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
B. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
A. When the Town finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Town may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,500. The Town
also retains the option to impose a surcharge on any user that violates
any provision of this article. The surcharge shall be applied to the user's
sewer bill covering the date(s) in which the violation occurred. The
surcharge amount is solely at the discretion of the Town and may be a
percentage up charge of the user's bill. In the event of repeated similar
violations, the surcharge may be incremental with each repeat
violation. Such fines or surcharges shall be assessed on a per-violation,
per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period
of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1% per month. A lien against

the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and
penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written appeal for the
Town to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit,
the Town Council shall consider the appeal at the next regularly
scheduled Council meeting. In the event that the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the user. The Town may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the
fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
A. The Town may immediately suspend a user's discharge after informal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Town may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW or which presents or may
present an endangerment to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a users failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Town may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or
endangerment to any individuals. The Town may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Town that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in § 167-31.44 of this
article are initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Town,
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
§§ 167-31.39 or 167-31.44 of this article.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.

§ 167-31.45. Injunctive relief.
When the Town finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town
may petition the Carroll County General District Court through the Town's
Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
article on activities of the user. The Town may also seek such other action

terminated at the discretion of the Town.
§ 167-31.54. Upsets.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of Subsection C are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the Town
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (If this information
is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days):
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is

prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is

157:255
§ 167-31.55. Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 167-26A of
this article or the specific prohibitions in § 167-26B(1) through (19) of this
article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that
its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
§ 167-31.56. Bypass.
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or
fails.
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passthrough
or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Town
was regularly in compliance with its VPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
A. Terms defined.
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment.
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C and D of this
section.
C. Notification of bypass.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Town, at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Town of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24

necessary by the Town's governing body.
§ 167-31.58. Pretreatment charges and fees.
The Town may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting
up and operating the Town's pretreatment program which may include:
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration
of the bypass, including exact dates and and times, if the bypass
has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Town may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
D. Approval of bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Town may take enforcement action
against a user for a bypass unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
(b) There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes
or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C of
this section.
(2) The Town may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Town determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in Subsection D(1) of this section.
A. Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications, including the cost
of processing such applications;
B. Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures, including

§ 170-1. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement, construction
and modification of small wind energy systems while promoting the safe,
effective and efficient use of small wind energy systems and not
unreasonably interfering with the development of independent renewable
energy sources.
§ 170-2. Applicability.
The requirements set forth in this chapter shall govern the siting of wind
energy systems used to generate electricity or perform work which may
be connected to the utility grid pursuant to Virginia's net metering laws
(§ 56-594 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended), serve as an
independent source of energy, or serve in a hybrid system.
§ 170-3. Siting and construction requirements.
The requirements for siting and construction of all small wind energy
systems regulated by this chapter shall include the following:
A. Small wind energy towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish,
unless FAA standards require otherwise, or if the owner is attempting
to conform the wind energy tower to the surrounding environment and
architecture, in which case it may be painted to reduce visual
obtrusiveness. A photo simulation may be required.
B. Small wind energy systems shall not be artificially lighted unless
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or appropriate
authority.
C. Small wind energy towers shall not have any signs, writing, or pictures
that may be construed as advertising.

§ 170-5. Compliance with federal and state requirements.
F. The applicant shall provide evidence that the provider of electric utility
service to the site has been informed of the applicant's intent to install
an interconnected customer-owned electricity generator, unless the
applicant intends, and so states on the application, that the system will
not be connected to the electricity grid. This action shall not construe
approval for net metering by the electric utility.
G. The applicant shall provide information demonstrating that the system
will be used primarily to reduce on-site consumption of electricity.
H. The wind energy tower height shall not exceed a maximum height of 35
feet.
I. The minimum distance between the ground and any protruding blades
utilized on a small wind energy system shall be 15 feet, as measured at
the lowest point of the arc of the blades. The supporting wind energy
tower shall also be enclosed with a six-foot-tall fence or the base of the
wind energy tower shall not be climbable for a distance of 12 feet.
J. The applicant shall provide proof of adequate liability insurance for a
small wind energy system. Whether or not the applicant is participating
in the net metering program, the applicant shall meet the insurance
coverage requirements set forth in Virginia Administrative Code 20
VAC 5-315-60.
K. The small wind energy system generators and alternators shall be
constructed so as to prevent the emission of radio and television signals
and shall comply with the provisions of Section 47 of the Federal Code

The wind energy system shall be set back a distance at least equal to
110% of the structure height from all adjacent property lines and a distance
equal to at least 150% of the structure height from any dwelling inhabited
by humans on neighboring property. These setbacks may be reduced by
notarized consent of the owner of the property on which the requested
wind energy system is to be erected and the adjacent landowner whose
property line or dwelling falls within the specified distance. Additionally,
such adjacent landowner must execute a deed of easement for the benefit of
the property on which the wind energy system is to be erected prohibiting

ARTICLE VII
Establishment and Purpose of Districts
§ 171-33. Districts established; purpose.
In order to implement all purposes and provisions of this chapter, the lands
within the corporate limits of the Town of Hillsville, Virginia, are divided
into the following districts, the purposes of which are as follows.
§ 171-34. A-1 Agricultural/Residential District.
The A-1 Agricultural/Residential District includes the sparsely developed
land of the town in which the principal use is currently used for lowdensity
agricultural and residential purposes. The regulations of this district
are designed to protect the agricultural sections of the community from
an influx of uses likely to render them undesirable for farms and future
development. The district is primarily a transitional agricultural area. This
zone is established for the specific purpose of:
§ 171-35. Residential districts.
A. Providing for the orderly expansion of urban development into
predominantly agricultural territory within the incorporated areas.
B. Confining such development to such locations as can feasibly be
supplied urban-type facilities.
C. Discouraging the random scattering of residential, commercial and
industrial uses into the area.
A. The residential districts established in this chapter are designed to
promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare by
encouraging the following goals for growth:
(1) Provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for residential
developments to adequately meet the housing needs of the present
and expected future population and provide a variety of choices in
site selections.
(2) Permit improved movement on the public ways and effectively
utilize existing public ways and, as far as possible, mitigate the
effects of heavy traffic and, more particularly, all through traffic in
residential areas.
(3) Protect residential areas against flood, fire, explosions and other
dangers and objectionable influences.
(4) Protect residential areas against undue congestion, as far as
possible, by regulating the density of population, the intensity of
activity and the bulk of buildings in relation to the surrounding land
and to one another, and by providing for off-street parking spaces
for automotive vehicles.
§ 171-33 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-35
157:303
(5) Provide for access of light and air to windows and for privacy, as far
as possible, by controls over the height of buildings and structures.
(6) Provide appropriate space for public and private educational,
religious, recreational and similar facilities and public utilities
which serve the needs of nearby residents and which do not create
objectionable influences; and coordinate the intensity of residential
land use with the appropriate community facilities.
(7) Provide the most desirable use of land in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan in order to protect the character of residential
neighborhoods, conserve the value of land and buildings and
protect the community's tax revenues.
B. Medium-Density Residential District. This district is designed to
provide suitable areas for medium-density residential development in
areas where necessary community services and facilities are provided
or where the extension of these facilities is physically and economically
feasible. This district will be characterized generally by single-family
dwellings with other type dwellings located where community services
and facilities are adequate to meet all demands. This district also
includes community facilities, public utilities and open spaces which
serve the residents of these districts. It is the express purpose of this
chapter to exclude in this district all buildings or other structures and
uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or
otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations
specifically provided for in these regulations shall be permitted if they
otherwise conform to the provisions of this chapter.
C. Multifamily Residential District. This district is designed to provide
suitable areas for high-density residential development where
necessary community services and facilities are available or where the
extension of these facilities is physically and economically feasible. It is
the intent of this district to allow multiple dwelling units in a building,
provided that there is sufficient lot area and open space in the lot
relative to the number of dwelling units. This district also includes
community facilities, public utilities and open spaces which serve the
residents of the district. It is the express purpose of this chapter to
exclude from the district all buildings or other structures and uses
having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or
otherwise, except that conditional uses and home occupations
specifically provided for in these regulations shall be permitted if they
otherwise conform to the provisions of this chapter.
D. MHP Mobile Home Park Residential District. This district is designed to
provide suitable areas for mobile home park residential development
where appropriate community services and facilities are provided or
where the extension of such facilities will be physically and
economically feasible. This district will be characterized by singlefamily
mobile home dwellings in mobile home parks, and accessory
structures. This district will also include community facilities, public
§ 171-35 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-35
157:304
§ 171-36. Commercial districts.
§ 171-37. Industrial District.
utilities and open spaces which serve the residents of the district.
Home occupations specifically provided for in these regulations shall be
permitted if they otherwise conform to the provisions of this chapter.
A. The commercial districts established by this chapter are designed to
promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare by
encouraging the following goals for growth:
(1) Provide sufficient space for the many and diverse types of
commercial activity needed to serve the people and industry of
Hillsville.
(2) Promote the improvement and orderly growth of the existing welllocated
commercial centers.
(3) Protect adjacent residential areas from offensive and detrimental
influences.
(4) Promote the most efficient and desirable land use.
B. NC Neighborhood Commercial District. This district is designed to
provide a limited variety of goods and services for the immediate
residential neighborhood. It is not intended that this district permit
uses which generate large volumes of traffic. Adequate buffers and
appropriate open spaces between commercial and residential areas are
required to protect the integrity of residential neighborhoods.
C. CC Core Commercial District. This district is designed to provide for a
wide range of retail, office, amusement and service uses normally found
in a central business district. High intensity of use is permitted in this
district, and increased building bulk is provided as a means of
encouraging such development. This district is intended to be designed
in a manner conducive to and safe for a high volume of pedestrian
traffic.
D. GC General Commercial District. This district is designed to provide
adequate space in appropriate locations for the establishment of a wide
variety of uses, including commercial trades and services,
entertainment facilities, offices and establishments engaged in
wholesale trade. Since these activities tend to generate relatively large
volumes of traffic and have other characteristics detrimental to
residential districts, their locations should be removed from the
proximity of residential districts as much as possible.
A. The industrial district established by this chapter is designed to
promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare by
encouraging the following goals for growth:
§ 171-35 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-37
157:305
§ 171-37.1. L Landfill District. [Added 5-10-2004]
The L Landfill District established by this chapter is designed to provide for
the controlled and orderly disposal of waste from residents of the Town of
Hillsville and surrounding areas by:
§ 171-38. Floodplain zoning. [Added 6-14-200465; amended
6-9-2008]
(1) Provide sufficient space in appropriate locations which are
adequately served by community facilities to meet the needs for
industrial expansion in Hillsville.
(2) Encourage industrial development which is free from hazards to
the public health and which is environmentally safe and
nonpolluting.
(3) Protect industrial activities against congestion, encroachment from
incompatible land uses and other adverse characteristics.
(4) Protect adjacent residential and commercial areas from
incompatible land uses and offensive influences.
(5) Promote the most efficient and desirable use of land.
B. In accordance with these goals, this district is designed to provide
space for a limited range of industrial uses which have high
performance standards and the least objectionable characteristics. In
this district all industrial operations shall be carried on within
completely enclosed neighboring properties. Residential uses are
excluded from this district. Only those community facility and
commercial uses which are essential to provide needed services for
industry are permitted in this district.
A. Providing sufficient space in appropriate locations to meet the waste
disposal needs of the residents of the Town and surrounding areas.
B. Protecting adjacent residential and commercial areas from
incompatible land uses, offensive influences and other adverse
characteristics.
C. Promoting the most efficient and desirable use of land.
A. General provisions.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of
life and property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the
disruption of commerce and governmental services, the
extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for
flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by:
65.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former § 171-38, F-1 Flood Hazard District
(overlay), as amended 11-11-1996.
§ 171-37 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-38
157:306
(a) Regulating uses, activities, and development which, alone or in
combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood
heights, velocities, and frequencies;
(b) Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and
development from locating within districts subject to flooding;
(c) Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do
occur in flood-prone districts to be protected and/or
floodproofed against flooding and flood damage; and
(d) Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which
are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
(2) Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of Hillsville and identified as being in the one-hundredyear
floodplain by the Federal Insurance Administration.
(3) Compliance and liability.
(a) No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be
located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or
structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms
and provisions of this section and any other applicable
ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of this section.
(b) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger
floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This section does not
imply that districts outside the floodplain district, or that land
uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or
flood damages.
(c) Records of actions associated with administering this section
shall be kept on file and maintained by the Town Manager.
(d) This section shall not create liability on the part of Hillsville or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this section or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(4) Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section supersedes any
ordinance currently in effect in flood-prone districts. However, any
underlying ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the
extent that its provisions are more restrictive than this section.
(5) Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence,
clause, or phrase of this section shall be declared invalid for any
§ 171-38 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-38
157:307
reason whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining
portions of this section. The remaining portions shall remain in full
force and effect; and for this purpose, the provisions of this section
are hereby declared to be severable.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION  The Federal Emergency Management
Agency designated one-hundred-year water surface elevation.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS  The board appointed to review
appeals made by individuals with regard to decisions of the Zoning
Administrator in the interpretation of this section.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations or storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building built to have the
lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid
foundation perimeter walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
ENCROACHMENT  The advance or infringement of uses, plant
growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or
development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow
capacity of a floodplain.
FLOOD or FLOODING 
FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA  Any land area susceptible to
being inundated by water from any source.
A general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
(a) The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source.
(b)
(1)
The collapse or subsistence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by
waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or
suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body
of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated
force of nature such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or
by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in
flooding as defined in Subsection (1)(a) of this definition.
(2)
§ 171-38 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-38

flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends
to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to
flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood
and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization in the watershed.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE  Any structure that is
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor;
provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure
in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of
Federal Code 44 CFR 60.3.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for
use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term
"manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and
other similar vehicles placed one a site for greater than 180 consecutive

§ 171-38 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-38
157:309
NEW CONSTRUCTION  For the purposes of determining insurance
rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced on
or after the effective date of an initial Flood Insurance Rate Map
on or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain
management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE  A vehicle which is:
SHALLOW FLOODING AREA  A special flood hazard area with base
flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel
does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA  The land in the floodplain subject
to a one-percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year

START OF CONSTRUCTION  The date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, substantial improvement or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation
on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of the construction means the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before

157:310
damaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
WATERCOURSE  A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial
flood damage may occur.
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
(1)
Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure.
(2)
C. Establishment of zoning districts.
(1) Description of districts.
(a) Basis of districts. The various floodplain districts shall include
special flood hazard areas. The basis for the delineation of
these districts shall be the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Carroll County and the Town of
Hillsville prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, dated August 28,
2008, as amended.
[1] The Approximated Floodplain District shall be those areas
identified as an A or A99 Zone on the maps accompanying
the Flood Insurance Study. In these zones, no detailed
flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the onehundred-
year floodplain boundary has been approximated.
[2] The Shallow Flooding District shall be those areas
identified as Zone AO or AH on the maps accompanying
the Flood Insurance Study.
(b) Overlay concept.
[1] The Floodplain Districts described above shall be overlays
to the existing underlying districts as shown on the Official
Zoning Ordinance Map, and as such, the provisions for the
§ 171-38 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-38
157:311
Floodplain Districts shall serve as a supplement to the
underlying district provisions.
[2] If there is any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of the Floodplain Districts and those of any
underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or
those pertaining to the Floodplain Districts shall apply.
[3] In the event any provision concerning a Floodplain District
is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or
administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic
underlying provisions shall remain applicable.
(2) Official Zoning Map. The boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard
Area and Floodplain Districts are established as shown on the
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and/or Flood Insurance Rate
Map which is declared to be a part of this section and which shall
be kept on file at the Town of Hillsville offices.
(3) District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the Floodplain
Districts may be revised by the Town of Hillsville where natural or
man-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed
studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents
the need for such change. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance
Administration.
(4) Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the Floodplain Districts shall be made by the Zoning
Officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of
the Districts, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make the necessary
determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of
the District boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical
evidence if he so desires.
D. District provisions.
(1) Permit and application requirements.
(a) Permit requirement. All uses, activities, and development
occurring within any Floodplain District shall be undertaken
only upon the issuance of a zoning permit. Such development
shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the
provisions of the section and with all other applicable codes
and ordinances, such as the VA USBC, as amended, and the
Town of Hillsville Subdivision Regulations.66 Prior to the
issuance of any such permit, the Zoning Officer shall require all
66.Editor's Note: See Ch. 140, Subdivision of Land.
§ 171-38 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-38
157:312
applications to include compliance with all applicable state and
federal laws.
(b) Site plans and permit applications. All applications for
development within any Floodplain District and all building
permits issued for the floodplain shall incorporate the
following information:
[1] For structures to be elevated, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement).
[2] For structures to be floodproofed (nonresidential only), the
elevation to which the structure will be floodproofed.
(2) General standards. In all special flood hazard areas, the following
provisions shall apply:
(a) New construction and substantial improvements shall be
according to the VA USBC, and shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
(b) Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and
consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting
wind forces.
(c) New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage.
(d) New construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
(e) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities, including duct work,
shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
(f) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system.
(g) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood
waters.
§ 171-38 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-38
157:313
(h) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and
constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination
from them during flooding.
(i) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
building that is in compliance with the provisions of this
section shall meet the requirements of new construction as
contained in this section.
(j) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
building that is not in compliance with the provisions of this
section shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not
furthered, extended, or replaced.
(k) In riverine situations, adjacent communities and the
Department of Conservation and Recreation (Department of
Floodplain Management) shall be notified prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and copies of such
notifications shall be submitted to FEMA.
(l) The flood-carrying capacity within an altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse shall be maintained.
(3) Specific standards. In all special flood hazard areas where base
flood elevations have been provided in the Flood Insurance Study
or generated according to Subsection D(4)(a), the following
provisions shall apply:
(a) Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including
manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood
elevation.
(b) Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential
building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to no lower than two feet above
the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A1-30, AE, and
AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated
provided that all areas of the building components below the
elevation corresponding to the BFE plus one foot are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water, and use structural components having the capability
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect
of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied.
(c) Elevated buildings. Enclosed areas of new construction or
substantially improved structures which are below the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall:
§ 171-38 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-38
157:314
[1] Not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or
limited storage of maintenance equipment used in
connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area
shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living
area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such
enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into
separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas.
[2] Be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials below
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
[3] Include, in Zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, measures to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this
requirement, the openings must either be certified by a
professional engineer or architect or meet the following
minimum design criteria:
[a] Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides
of each enclosed area subject to flooding.
[b] The total net area of all openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding.
[c] If a building has more than one enclosed area, each
area must have openings to allow floodwaters to
automatically enter and exit.
[d] The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the adjacent grade.
[e] Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other opening coverings or devices, provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions.
[f] Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are
not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes,
and, therefore, do not require openings. Masonry or
wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires openings as
outlined above.
(d) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
[1] All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved,
on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in a new
§ 171-38 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-38
157:315
manufactured home park or subdivision or in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision in which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as
the result of a flood, must meet all the requirements for
new construction, including the elevation and anchoring
requirements in Subsection D(2)(a) and (b) and D(3)(a).
[2] Elevation and anchoring.
[a] All manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision in which a manufactured home has not
incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood
must be elevated so that either:
[b] The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated
no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation;
or
[c] The manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at
least equivalent strength that are no less than 36
inches in height above grade.
[d] The manufactured home must be securely anchored to
the adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
[3] All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
[a] Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
[b] Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on
its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security
devices and has no permanently attached additions);
or
[c] Meet all the requirements for manufactured homes in
Subsection D(3)(d).
(4) Standards for approximated floodplain. The following provisions
shall apply within the approximate floodplain district:
(a) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state, or any other source, in order to
administer the provisions of Subsection D. When such base
flood elevation data is utilized, the Zoning Administrator shall
obtain:
§ 171-38 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-38
157:316
[1] The elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) of the
lowest floor (including the basement) of all new and
substantially improved structures; and
[2] If the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with
the requirements of Subsection D(3)(b) of this section, the
elevation in relation to the mean sea level to which the
structure has been floodproofed.
(b) When the data is not available from any source as in
Subsection D(4)(a), the lowest floor of the structure shall be
elevated to no lower than two feet above the highest adjacent
grade.
(5) Standards for the floodway. The following provisions shall apply
within the floodway when it has been identified as in Subsection
D(4)(a):
(a) Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments are prohibited unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels
during occurrence of the base flood discharge. Development
activities which increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant
first applies  with Hillsville's endorsement  for a conditional
Flood Insurance Rate Map and floodway revision, and receives
the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(b) If Subsection D(5)(a) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of Subsection D.
(c) The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is
prohibited, except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile
homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured
home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, provided the anchoring, elevation, and
encroachment standards are met.
(6) Standards for subdivision proposals.
(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(c) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
§ 171-38 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-38
157:317
(d) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development proposals
(including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that
exceed 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser.
E. Variance factors to be considered.
(1) In passing upon applications for variances, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified
in other sections of the Zoning Ordinance and consider the
following additional factors:
(a) The showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments. No variance shall be
granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within
any Floodway District that will cause any increase in the onehundred-
year flood elevation.
(c) The danger that materials maybe swept on to other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
(d) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and
unsanitary conditions.
(e) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owners.
(f) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
(g) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
(h) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
(i) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable
future.
(j) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for the area.
(k) The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the
property in time of flood.
(l) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
(m) The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
§ 171-38 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-38
157:318
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(n) Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
section.
(2) The Board of Zoning Appeals may refer any application and
accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a
variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for
technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation
to flood heights and velocities and the adequacy of the plans for
flood protection and other related matters.
(3) Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals
has determined that the granting of such will not result in
unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights; additional
threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense; and will not
create nuisances; cause fraud or victimization of the public; or
conflict with local laws or ordinances.
(4) Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals
has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to
provide relief from exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(5) The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the applicant for a
variance, in writing, that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the one-hundred-year flood elevation increases the
risks to life and property; and will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
(6) A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all
variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the
variances. Any variances that are issued shall be noted in the
annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administrator.
F. Existing structures in floodplain areas. A structure or use of a structure
or premises which lawfully existed before the enactment of these
provisions, but which is not in conformity with these provisions, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
(1) Existing structures in the Floodway Area shall not be expanded or
enlarged unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practices that the proposed expansion would not result
in any increase in the base flood elevation.
(2) Any modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or
improvement of any kind to a structure and/or use located in any
flood plain areas to an extent or amount of less than 50% of its
market value shall conform to the VA USBC.
§ 171-38 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-38
157:319
(3) The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or
improvement of any kind to a structure and/or use, regardless of its
location in a floodplain area, to an extent or amount of 50% or more
of its market value shall be undertaken only in full compliance with
this section and shall require the entire structure to conform to the
VA USBC.

terms "nonconforming use," "nonconforming feature" and "nonconforming
building" shall have such meanings as specified in § 171-8 of this chapter.
§ 171-73. Extension of nonconforming use.
No nonconforming use shall be extended, enlarged or moved so as to occupy
a different or greater area of land or buildings than was occupied by and
actively devoted to such use at the time it became nonconforming, provided
that a nonconforming use may be extended throughout such portion of land
or such part of a building which was lawfully arranged, designed, equipped
and intended for such use at the time it became nonconforming.
§ 171-74. Alterations to buildings devoted to nonconforming uses.
No building or portion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use shall
be enlarged, extended, structurally altered, reconstructed or moved, unless
such building or portion of a building is thereafter devoted to a use which
conforms with the use regulations of this chapter. Nothing in this Article
shall be construed to prohibit normal repair, maintenance or incidental
alteration of a building or the alteration, strengthening or restoring of a
building to safe condition as may be required by law.
§ 171-75. Change of nonconforming use.
§ 171-76. Discontinuance of nonconforming uses.

be changed to a use which conforms with the use regulations of this
chapter or to a use, other than multifamily, which is first permitted by
right in a more restricted zoning district as indicated by § 171-41, Table
of Permitted Uses. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to
a conforming use or to a more restricted use, such use shall not
thereafter be changed back to the original nonconforming use or to any
less restricted use.
B. For purposes of this Article, the term "use" shall mean a type of activity
listed on the Table of Permitted Uses, and a change in occupancy,
ownership or management shall not in itself constitute a change in use.
A. Whenever a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a
building is discontinued for a period of more than 24 consecutive
months, whether or not equipment or fixtures intended for such use are
removed, any subsequent use shall conform with the use regulations of
the district in which the property is located.

buildings devoted to nonconforming uses.
B. In case of determination by the Zoning Administrator that a
nonconforming use has been changed to an illegal use, such illegal use
shall cease and any subsequent use on the premises shall be in
conformity with the use regulations of this chapter or the illegal use
may be changed to the last lawful nonconforming use to occupy the
premises.
A. A building which is nonconforming with respect to the bulk regulations
or other feature required by this chapter may nonetheless be occupied
by a use permitted in the district in which such building is located,
provided that off-street parking and loading requirements for the use
are satisfied.
B. A building which is devoted to a conforming use and is nonconforming
with respect to the bulk regulations or other feature required by this
chapter may be enlarged, extended or structurally altered, provided
that the degree or extent of any nonconforming feature is not
increased.
C. An increase in the height of a building or portion of a building which is
nonconforming with respect to a yard requirement shall be deemed to
be an increase in the extent of the nonconforming feature of the
building.
A. Damage not exceeding 50% of value. Any building having a
nonconforming feature or building devoted to a nonconforming use
which is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or the public enemy to
an extent not exceeding 50% of its most recent assessed taxable value
may be restored, repaired, reconstructed and used as before the
damage, provided that the degree or extent of any nonconforming
feature that existed prior to the damage shall not be increased and the
area devoted to any nonconforming use prior to the damage shall not be
increased. Such restoration, repair, reconstruction or reuse shall be
completed within 24 months of the date of damage.
B. Damage exceeding 50% of value. Whenever a building having a
nonconforming feature or a building devoted to a nonconforming use is
damaged by any cause whatsoever to an extent greater than 50% of its
most recent assessed taxable value, such building shall not be restored,
repaired, reconstructed or used except in conformance with all of the
applicable provisions of this chapter, except as may be authorized by
the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to Subsection C.
C. Special exception. Subject to the conditions of this section, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to grant a special exception as
§ 171-76 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-78
157:370
§ 171-79. Intermittent, temporary or illegal use.
Intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or buildings shall not be
construed to establish the existence of a nonconforming use for the
purposes of this Article.
§ 171-79.1. Replacement of nonconforming manufactured homes.
[Added 12-9-1996; amended 3-25-2013]
Removal and replacement of a manufactured home which constitutes a
nonconforming use on an individual lot or within a manufactured home
park or removal of any manufactured or mobile home unit which does
not conform to current Federal Manufactured Housing Construction and
Safety Standards and not Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved
and manufactured in 1980 and prior and replacement of such unit with a
manufactured home which conforms to said standards shall be permitted,
provided the replacement takes place within 60 days of removal.
provided in Article XVIII of this chapter for restoration, repair,
reconstruction or reuse of a building damaged by fire, explosion, act
of God or the public enemy to an extent greater than 50% of its most
recent assessed taxable value.
(1) Before granting any special exception, the Board shall be satisfied
from the evidence presented that the proposed restoration, repair,
reconstruction or reuse would result in the minimum deviation
from the provisions of this chapter necessary to enable reasonable
use of the property with consideration for its use prior to the
damage. Whenever possible, the Board shall require reduction in
the degree or extent of nonconforming features and uses. In no
case shall the Board authorize restoration, repair, reconstruction or
reuse to any extent that constitutes a greater deviation from the
provisions of this chapter than existed prior to the damage.
(2) Before granting any special exception, the Board shall receive
testimony and make a finding that restoration, repair or
reconstruction of the building will not unreasonably impair light
and air to adjoining property, will not impair established property
values in the immediate area and will not otherwise be detrimental
to the health, safety and general welfare of the public. Before
granting any special exception to reestablish a nonconforming use,
the Board shall also receive testimony and find that the continued
operation of the nonconforming use is in the public interest and
contributes to public convenience.

§ 171-81. Application for conditional use permit.
A. Intent of conditional use provisions. Conditional use provisions are
intended as a means for the Town Council, after review and
recommendation by the Planning Commission, to authorize certain uses
which, although generally appropriate in the district in which they are
permitted, have potentially greater impacts on neighboring properties
than uses which are permitted by right. The conditional use permit
procedure provides the opportunity for the Town Council to review each
proposed conditional use and impose such conditions as reasonably
necessary to ensure the use will be compatible with the surrounding
area and consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
B. Conditional use permit required. A use indicated as permitted as a
conditional use in § 171-41 of this chapter shall be authorized only upon
approval of a conditional use permit by the Town Council. No zoning
permit for a conditional use or for a building devoted to a conditional
use shall be issued unless a conditional use permit has been approved
in accordance with this Article.
C. Existing uses. Any use specified as a conditional use in the district in
which it is located and for which no conditional use permit has been
approved shall be considered a nonconforming use, provided that such
use was legally established prior to the effective date of this chapter.
A. Submission of applications. Applications for conditional use permits
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator and may be filed by the
owner of the property or, with the written consent of the owner, the
contract purchaser of the property or an agent of the owner.

determine compliance with this chapter and to evaluate potential
impacts of a proposed conditional use.
A. Review by Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall review
each conditional use permit application and forward the application to
the Planning Commission. At such time as requested by the
Commission, the Zoning Administrator shall submit to it a report
indicating the manner in which the proposed conditional use complies
or does not comply with the provisions of this chapter and any
recommendations the Zoning Administrator may have regarding
approval, disapproval or conditions to be attached to the proposed use

approval or disapproval of the conditional use permit or that
conditions be imposed to ensure compliance with the
requirements, standards and factors set forth in this Article.
(3) All actions by the Commission shall be in the form of a motion,
giving the reasons for the action and the vote of each member. All
actions shall be recorded in the Commission's records. Each
recommendation to the Council shall include a statement of the
relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan of the
town.
(4) In any case where the Commission is unable to adopt a motion to
recommend approval or disapproval, it shall forward a written
report to the Council stating such fact and summarizing its
discussions on the matter.
C. Action by Town Council.
(1) The Town Council shall take action on each conditional use permit
application in accordance with the following:

§ 171-91. Notice to affected property owners.
It shall be the general rule of the Board that reasonable efforts shall be
made to contact and notify interested parties who, in the opinion of the
Board, may be affected by any matter brought before the Board. In all cases
all owners of record of adjoining property, including those separated by a
public way from the premises in question, shall be notified. The notification
required to meet this provision shall be accomplished by certified mail
addressed to the respective owner at the address given in the latest tax
assessment.
§ 171-92. Standards for variances.
The Board shall not grant a variance unless it finds that:
A. The application for a zoning variance may be made by any property
owner, tenant, government official, department, board or bureau. The
application shall be made to the Zoning Administrator in accordance
with rules adopted by the Board. The application and accompanying
maps, plans or other information shall be transmitted promptly to the
Board. Not more than 60 days after filing such application, a hearing
shall be held on the application. Notice of the hearing shall be in
accordance with the hearing procedures in § 15.1-431, Code of Virginia
1950, as amended. A fee (see Appendix D) shall be charged to partially
defray the cost of review and processing for each application for a
variance, except that the fee shall be waived for any governmental
agency. (See Appendix A for procedure).70 [Amended 11-11-1996]
B. The Zoning Administrator shall transmit a copy of the variance
application and accompanying maps, plans and other information to the
Planning Commission, which may submit a recommendation to the
Board.
A. The property owner acquired the property in good faith and that, by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape or
exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary conditions
of the property or of the use or development of property immediately
adjacent to it, the strict application of the terms of this chapter would
effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property;

buildings in the same district or in other districts shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.
§ 171-94. Use variances prohibited.
Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant a variance
to allow a use not permitted under the terms of this chapter in the district
involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this chapter in said district.
§ 171-95. Conditions and restrictions by Board.
The Board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises
benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the provisions
set out in § 171-92 to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such
variance upon surrounding property and to better carry out the general
intent of this chapter. The Board may establish expiration dates as a
condition or as a part of the variance. The Board may require a guarantee
or bond to insure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to
be complied with.
B. The strict application of the ordinance would produce undue hardship;
C. The hardship is not generally shared by other properties in the same
zoning district and the same vicinity;
D. The Board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it, that the granting
of such variance will alleviate a demonstrable hardship approaching
confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience
sought by the applicant;
E. The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment
to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be
changed by the granting of the variance;
F. The condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended
use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make
reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be
adopted as an amendment to this chapter;
G. The variance shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose
of this chapter;
H. Financial concerns shall not be the sole consideration as a basis for
granting a variance; and
I. Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures
or buildings in the same district.

§ 171-105. Procedure for conditional zoning.
A. Pursuant to applicable provisions of §§ 15.1-491.1 through 15.1-491.6,
Code of Virginia 1950, as amended, the purpose of conditional zoning is
to recognize that frequently, where competing and incompatible uses
conflict, traditional zoning methods and procedures are inadequate,
and that in such cases more flexible and adaptable zoning methods are
needed to permit differing land uses and at the same time to recognize
the effects of change.
B. It is, therefore, the intent of this Article to provide a more flexible and
adaptable zoning method to cope with such situations, whereby a
change in the zoning classification of property may be allowed subject
to certain conditions proffered by the petitioner for the protection of the
community that are not generally applicable to land similarly zoned.
C. It is the intent of the Town Council that the provisions of this Article
shall not be used for the purpose of discrimination in housing.
A. Conditions may be proffered. In conjunction with a petition to change
the zoning classification of property and as a part of a proposed
amendment to the Zoning Map72 as described in Article XX of this
chapter, the owner of such property may voluntarily proffer, in writing,
reasonable conditions in addition to the regulations specified for the
zoning district by this chapter, provided that such conditions meet the
criteria in § 171-106 of this Article.
B. Submission of conditions. The owner may submit such conditions at the
time of submission of the petition to change the zoning classification of
the property or at any other time before the Planning Commission
makes its recommendation on the petition to the Town Council.
C. Modifications to conditions.
(1) In the event that additions, deletions or modifications to conditions
are desired by the owner of the property that is the subject of the
rezoning request, they shall be made, in writing, to the Planning
Commission before the Commission makes its recommendation to
the Town Council.
(2) The Town Council may consider additional conditions, deletions or
modifications to conditions after the Planning Commission makes
its recommendation, provided that such are voluntarily proffered,

administer and enforce conditions attached to a rezoning or amendment or
a Zoning Map, including:
in writing, prior to the public hearing at which the Town Council is
to consider the petition.
A. The rezoning itself must give rise for the conditions.
B. Such conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning.

improvements except those sewerage or drainage facilities otherwise
authorized by law.
F. No condition shall be proffered that is not related to the physical
development or physical operation of the property.
G. Such condition shall be in conformity with the town's Comprehensive
Plan.
H. The provisions of this chapter shall not be used for the purpose of
discrimination in housing.
A. The Zoning Map shall show by an appropriate symbol the existence of
conditions attached to the zoning of the map.
B. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a conditional zoning index
which shall be available in the Zoning Administrator's office for public
inspection during regular office hours. The index shall provide ready
access to the ordinance creating such conditions in accordance with the
article and shall clearly list all conditions applicable to each.
A. Ordering, in writing, compliance with such conditions.

provisions of this Article and applicable provisions of Title 15.1, Code of
Virginia 1950, as amended.
§ 171-111. Time limit on repeat petitions.
After the Town Council has taken official action either granting, denying or
permitting withdrawal of a petition for any change in zoning or any change
of zoning conditions, no other petitions for substantially the same change(s)
shall again be considered in less than 12 months from the date of such
official action.
B. Bringing of appropriate legal action or proceedings to ensure
compliance.
C. Requiring a guaranty or contract, or both, for construction of physical
improvements required by conditions.
D. Denial of zoning permits and certificates of zoning compliance for
failure to meet conditions.

Administrator pursuant to the provisions of § 171-108 of this Article
may petition the Town Council for review of such decision by filing a
petition with the Zoning Administrator and with the Town Council
within 30 days of the decision. Such petition shall specify the grounds
upon which the petitioner is aggrieved.
B. In deciding any such case, the Town Council shall have the same
authority as vested in the Zoning Administrator, but shall not modify or
delete any condition attached to a Zoning Map amendment except by
formal amendment pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Article.

Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
[Added 2-11-2013]
§ 171-119. Summary of general procedural requirements.
The following is for informational purposes to enable a conceptual
understanding of the major procedural differences between applying for
a new tower or a wireless telecommunications facility that increases or
extends above the height of the structure attached to and a co-location that
does not.
A. All applications. All applications shall be required to comply with all
applicable provisions of this article, including, but not limited to,
§ 171-125, and prove the following:
(1) The need for the facility to provide functionally reliable service to
the exclusion of all other alternatives, such as, but not limited to,
adjusting existing adjacent facilities;
(2) The need for the facility at the location proposed;
(3) The facility is designed to be safe and structurally sound for the use
and loads intended;
(4) The facility will be the least visually intrusive as reasonably
possible in order to provide functionally reliable service primarily
and essentially within the Town; and
(5) Establish with the Town an escrow deposit, as required, to assure
that the taxpayers do not incur the cost associated with processing
and reviewing the application.
B. New tower or increasing the height of a structure. An application for a
new tower or for a co-location that increases or extends above the
height of the existing structure attached to shall be deemed a new
tower and require the following:
(1) A nonrefundable application fee of $5,000;
(2) Prove that there is no alternative to a new tower or to extending
above the top of the facility attached to in order to provide
functionally reliable service primarily and essentially within the
Town;
(3) Prove the need for the facility to be located at the height proposed
in order to provide functionally reliable service primarily and
essentially within the Town;
(4) Provide evidence as required that the facility is designed to be
secure and structurally safe for the use and loads intended;
(5) A public hearing.

§ 171-120. Purpose; intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the Town of Hillsville's
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of
wireless telecommunications facilities. The Town of Hillsville, hereinafter
referred to as "Town," finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may
pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character
and environment of the Town and its inhabitants. The Town also recognizes
that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an
economic development asset to the Town and of significant benefit to the
Town and its residents. In order to insure that the placement, construction
or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with
the Town's land use policies, the Town is adopting a single, comprehensive
wireless telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The
intent of this article is to minimize the negative impact of wireless
telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for
review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive
review of environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health,
safety and welfare of the Town of Hillsville.
§ 171-121. Title.
This article shall be known and cited as the "Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities Siting Ordinance for the Town of Hillsville."
§ 171-122. Severability.
C. Co-location not increasing the height or extending above the top of the
existing structure. An application to co-locate on an existing structure
that does not extend above the existing top of the structure or increase
its height shall be required to:
(1) Submit a nonrefundable application fee of $2,000;
(2) Prove the need for the facility to provide functionally reliable
service primarily and essentially within the Town;
(3) Camouflage the antennas and associated equipment so as to be as
visually innocuous and unobtrusive as possible. There shall be no
requirement for a public hearing for such a facility, and the permit
shall be granted administratively.
A. If any word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other
portion of this article or any application thereof to any person or
circumstance is declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid for any
reason, then such word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or
other portion, or the proscribed application thereof, shall be severable,
and the remaining provisions of this article, and all applications thereof,

times of the test at least 14 days in advance. The balloon shall be flown
for at least four consecutive hours sometime between 7:00 a.m. and
4:00 p.m. on the dates chosen. The primary date shall be on a weekend,
but in case of poor weather on the initial date, the secondary date may
be on a weekday.
W. The applicant will provide a written copy of an analysis, completed by a
qualified individual or organization, to determine if the tower or
existing structure intended to support wireless facilities requires
lighting under Federal Aviation Administration Regulation Part 77. This
requirement shall be for any new tower or for an existing structure or
building where the application increases the height of the structure or
building. If this analysis determines that the FAA must be contacted,
then all filings with the FAA, all responses from the FAA and any related

then a detailed explanation must be provided as to why a site of a
higher priority was not selected. The person seeking such an exception
must satisfactorily demonstrate the technological reason or reasons
why such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the
technological problems in the context of providing functionally reliable
service and the harm or hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site at the
proposed location.
§ 171-125 HILLSVILLE CODE § 171-126
157:406
§ 171-127. Shared use of facilities and other structures.
C. An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the site
proposed is the only site leased or selected. An application shall
address co-location as an option. If such option is not proposed, the
applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the Town why
co-location at any alternative location(s) is commercially,
technologically, or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between
providers limiting or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis
for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
D. Notwithstanding the above, the Town may approve any site located
within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the Town
finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety
and welfare of the Town and its inhabitants and will not have a
deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and
neighborhood.
E. The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority,
demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If
appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed
written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not
selected shall be included with the application, including all supporting
technological documentation and studies needed to make such a
determination.
F. Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the Town may disapprove
an application for any of the following reasons.
(1) Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
(2) Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or
historical district;
(3) The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities
which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning
or land use designation;
(4) The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the
reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees
and agents of the Town, or employees of the service provider or
other service providers;
(5) Conflicts with the provisions of this article.
A. Locating on existing towers or other structures without increasing the
height, as opposed to the construction of a new tower, shall be
preferred by the Town. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive
report inventorying existing towers and other suitable structures within
§ 171-126 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 171-127

technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially
within the Town, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
A. The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the total height of
any tower, facility and/or antenna and the basis therefor. Such
documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the
height needed to provide functionally reliable service primarily and
essentially within the Town, to the extent practicable, unless good
cause is shown.
B. The maximum permitted height of a new tower shall be that needed for
functionally reliable service based on up to six co-located antenna
arrays requiring six feet of vertical space each, and the ambient tree
height in the immediate area around the proposed tower. The
installation must be proven to have minimal visual and environmental
impact on the community.
C. Building-mounted antennas should be located and designed to be an
integral part of the building and shall be secured or camouflaged, as
necessary or as reasonably required by the Town Council, to minimize
the visual impact and minimize any change in or impact on the nature
and character of the community and shall not increase the height of the
building.
D. No tower constructed after the effective date of this article, including
allowing for all attachments, shall exceed that height which shall permit
operation without required artificial lighting of any kind in accordance
with municipal, Town, state, and/or any federal statute, law, local law,
Town ordinance, code, rule or regulation.

§ 171-135. Public hearing; notification.
A. The Town may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist the
Town in reviewing and evaluating the application, including the
construction and modification of the site, once permitted, and any
requests for recertification.
B. An applicant shall deposit with the Town funds sufficient to reimburse
the Town for all reasonable costs of consultant and expert evaluation
and consultation to the Town in connection with the review of any
application, including the construction and modification of the site,
once permitted. The initial deposit shall be $8,500. The placement of
the $8,500 with the Town shall precede the pre-application meeting.
The Town will maintain a separate escrow account for all such funds.
The Town's consultants/experts shall invoice the Town for its services in
reviewing the application, including the construction and modification
of the site, once permitted. If at any time during the process this escrow
account has a balance less than $2,500, the applicant shall immediately,
upon notification by the Town, replenish said escrow account so that it
has a balance of at least $5,000. Such additional escrow funds shall be
deposited with the Town before any further action or consideration is
taken on the application. In the event that the amount held in escrow by
the Town is more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the
conclusion of the project, the remaining balance shall be promptly
refunded to the applicant.
C. The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in Subsection B of this
section may vary with the scope and complexity of the project, the
completeness of the application and other information as may be
needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any
construction or modification.
A. No person shall be permitted to site, place, build, construct, modify or
prepare any site for the placement or use of wireless
telecommunications facilities as of the effective date of this article
without having first obtained a special exception permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this section, no special exception permit shall be required
for those noncommercial exceptions noted in the definition of "wireless
telecommunications facilities."
B. All wireless telecommunications facilities existing on or before the
effective date of this article shall be allowed to continue as they
presently exist; provided however, that any visible modification or
addition of providers on an existing wireless telecommunications
facility must comply with this article. Any modification of the facilities
on an existing tower shall require the tower to come into compliance
with this article.

§ 171-136. Action on application for special exception permits.
A. Prior to the approval of any application for a special exception permit
for a new tower or a co-located wireless facility that extends above the
top of the structure attached to, thereby increasing the height of the
structure, a public hearing shall be held by the Town, notice of which
shall be published in the official newspaper of the Town no less than 10
calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the public hearing. In order
that the Town may notify nearby landowners, the application shall
contain the names and addresses of all landowners whose property is
located within 1,500 feet of any property line of the lot or parcel on
which the new wireless telecommunications facilities are proposed to
be located.
B. There shall be no public hearing required for an application to co-locate
on an existing tower or other similar structure that does not increase
the height by extending above the top of the structure. Subject to the
requirements contained in § 171-25, an application to co-locate on an
existing tower or similar structure that does not increase the height by
extending above the top of the structure shall be handled
administratively.
C. The Town shall schedule the public hearing referred to in Subsection A
of this section once it finds the application is complete. The Town, at
any stage prior to issuing a special exception permit, may require such
additional information as it deems necessary.
A. The Town will undertake a review of an application pursuant to this
article in a timely fashion and shall act within a reasonable period of
time, given the relative complexity of the application and the
circumstances, with due regard for the public's interest and need to be
involved and the applicant's desire for a timely resolution.
B. The Town may refer any application or part thereof to any advisory or
other committee for a nonbinding recommendation.
C. After the public hearing and after formally considering the application,
the Town may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a special
exception permit. Its decision shall be in writing and shall be supported
by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The burden of
proof for the grant of the permit shall always be upon the applicant.
D. If the Town approves the special exception permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities, then the applicant shall be notified of
such approval, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the Town's action,
and the special exception permit shall be issued within 30 days after
such approval. Except for necessary building permits, and subsequent
certificates of compliance, once a special exception permit has been
granted hereunder, no additional permits or approvals from the Town,
such as site plan or zoning approvals, shall be required by the Town for

date after the effective date of the special exception permit and all
subsequent five-year anniversaries of the effective date of the original
special exception permit for wireless telecommunications facilities, the
holder of a special exception permit for such wireless
telecommunications facilities shall submit a signed written request to

with the special exception permit and compliance with all
applicable codes, laws, rules and regulations;
(7) Recertification that the tower and attachments both are designed
and constructed and continue to meet all local, Town, state and
federal structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice
loads. Such recertification shall be by a professional engineer
licensed in the state, the cost of which shall be borne by the
applicant.
B. If, after such review, the Town determines that the permitted wireless
telecommunications facilities are in compliance with the special
exception permit and all applicable statutes, laws, local laws,
ordinances, codes, rules and regulations, then the Town may issue a
recertification of the special exception permit for the wireless
telecommunications facilities, which may include any new provisions or
conditions that are mutually agreed upon, or that are required by

applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, codes, rules or regulations. If,
after such review, it is determined that the permitted wireless
telecommunications facilities are not in compliance with the special
exception permit and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, codes,
rules and regulations, then the Town may refuse to issue a
recertification special exception permit for the wireless
telecommunications facilities, and in such event, such wireless
telecommunications facilities shall not be used after the date that the
applicant receives written notice of the decision by the Town until such
time as the facility is brought into compliance. Any decision requiring
the cessation of use of the facility or imposing a penalty shall be in
writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written
record and shall be promptly provided to the owner of the facility.
C. If the applicant has submitted all of the information requested and
required by this article, and if the review is not completed, as noted in
Subsection B of this section, prior to the five-year anniversary date of
the special exception permit, or subsequent five-year anniversaries,
then the applicant for the permitted wireless telecommunications
facilities shall receive an extension of the special exception permit for
up to six months, in order for the completion of the review.
D. If the holder of a special exception permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities does not submit a request for
recertification of such special exception permit within the timeframe
noted in Subsection A of this section, then such special exception
permit and any authorizations granted thereunder shall cease to exist
on the date of the fifth anniversary of the original granting of the
special exception permit, or subsequent five-year anniversaries, unless
the holder of the special exception permit adequately demonstrates
that extenuating circumstances prevented a timely recertification
request. If the Town agrees that there were legitimately extenuating
circumstances, then the holder of the special exception permit may
submit a late recertification request or application for a new special
exception permit.
A. Such special exception permit shall be nonexclusive.
B. Such special exception permit shall not be assigned, transferred or
conveyed without the express prior written notification to the Town.
