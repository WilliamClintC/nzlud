Minimum requirements for the installation of a master fire alarm box or auxiliary systems
connected to fire alarm headquarters via municipal circuits in the City of Barre are as follows.
(c) GENERAL. The Master fire Alarm Box protecting a property shall be Local-Energy type,
shall be located outside the building protected and must be in a location that is easily accessible.
The entire installation, including all material to be connected to the municipal fire alarm circuits,
must be new or approved, must be furnished and installed by the owner of the property protected,
and the complete installation shall be his, for as long as the equipment is connected to the
municipal fire alarm circuit.
In the event that trouble or faults develop in any part of the private system, it shall be the
prerogative of the Fire Department of the City of Barre to disconnect any part or all, of the
private system from the municipal circuits. And, in the event that this procedure takes place, the
owner or agents of the property shall be notified, providing they have furnished this department
with the proper addresses and telephone numbers where they can be reached.
(d) MASTER BOX. The Master Box shall be of the local energy type with the following
features:
• Non-interference
• Quick Succession
• Automatic Grounding under open circuit conditions
• Telegraph Key
• Tap Bell
• Test Panel
• Flush Mounted box shall be weatherproof
• Lock and Key-Barre City specification
• Code Wheel Index-Barre City specification

It must be installed in conduit or approved tubing, and conform to the requirements of the
3/8/2010 ORDINANCES
- 606 -
National Electrical Code. Also, NFPA pamphlet 72 and 73. All wiring beyond the supervisory
panel must be of an approved type for the equipment used and shall be inspected and approved
by the Superintendent of Fire Alarm, or his designated agents, before connection is made to the
municipal circuits.
(g) ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. In an installation where the fire-protective system is
installed in more than one building, or more than one floor and where the system is connected to
one Master Box, an enunciator shall be installed on the inside of the buildings adjacent to the
Master Box. This enunciator shall identify the location of the originating signals.
(h) LOCAL ENERGY SYSTEMS. In the installation of private systems operating from Local
Energy, the system shall be designed so that the accidental loss of operating current will not
operate the tripping mechanism of the Master Box. If batteries are used, these batteries will be
the secondary, storage type battery. This type unit shall have built-in provisions for trickle
charge on the battery cabinet.
The use of primary batteries, or dry batteries is not acceptable.
(i) WATERFLOW DETECTORS (SPRINKLER SYSTEMS). Waterflow detectors installed in
wet sprinkler systems must have incorporated in them an approved retard device which will
prevent false signals from being sent to the fire alarm headquarters on such occasions as low
water pressure, or pressure surges in the risers.
(j) CONNECTION TO MUNICIPAL CIRCUITS. In areas where the private system is to be
connected to a municipal circuit of the aerial construction type, the owner of the property shall
bring two #12 solid core copper wires from the Master Box to a point on the outside of the
building designated by the Superintendent of fire Alarm. These wires shall be enclosed in rigid
conduit and shall be brought to an appropriate dead end device close to the weather cap. This
device shall not be less than sixteen feet above the ground level and shall be securely fastened to
the building. In areas where it is more expedient to wire using the underground method, the
owner shall install rigid conduit, 2" or larger, from a point designated by the Fire Alarm
Superintendent to a point near the location of the Master Box or to the Master Box itself.
The system owner shall be responsible for all wire and costs associated with making the
connection from the outside weather-head to the nearest point of connection of the municipal fire
alarm circuit.
Final cut-over connection of the system shall be made by City of Barre Fire Alarm employees or
under their supervision.
Any alternate plans of wiring the fire alarm service connection from the street to the building
shall be discussed with the Fire Alarm Superintendent prior to installation.
(k) LIGHTNING ARRESTER. A lightning arrester meeting the specifications of the City of
Barre shall be installed near the weather-head and connected to a suitable ground. State of the
art compact type lightning arresters may be placed in the master box itself as an acceptable
3/8/2010 ORDINANCES
- 607 -
means of protection.
(l) GROUNDING. Both the master box and the lightning arrester must be grounded as follows:
A common ground for both devices is acceptable. Ground wires shall not be run in the same
conduit with the fire alarm wires.
An enclosed # 8 copper wire or equivalent shall be used to connect the ground terminal of the
Master Box to a suitable ground in order to provide mechanical strength, or if enclosed in a metal
pipe, a # 12 solid copper wire may be used. Suitable grounds are:
1. An underground metallic water piping system.
2. A ground rod not less than 1/2 inch in diameter and 8 feet long into permanently moist
soil.
3. The resistance of a ground connection shall not exceed 25 ohms
(m) RED LIGHTS. A red light of no less than 24 watts shall be mounted above the master fire
alarm box. There shall be no switch on this light unless it is connected to a night light circuit
that is turned on every night for all night.
(n) TESTING. Master Boxes will be tested for operation during the regular procedure of this
work and they will be tested no less than once every six months. The master box must be
available for test during all normal working days and hours. The auxiliary equipment attached to
this master box will not be tested by the Barre City Fire Department and will be considered to be
part of the owners responsibility in maintenance of their system. However, whenever any system
is worked on or tested, either internal system or sprinkler system, the Barre City Fire Department
will be notified prior and will send a person to plug the system out when requested and to reset
the master box when all work is complete.
(o) PLANS. Plans or prints shall be submitted for approval to the Fire Chief or Superintendent
of Fire Alarm prior to all installations, along with the form attached to this set of standards.
(p) REQUIREMENT FOR CONNECTION. The requirement for connection to the municipal
fire alarm circuit shall be governed by the State of Vermont fire Prevention Division of the
Department of Labor and Industry. It shall also be administered by the City of Barre Fire Chief
when calling for a decision by the Authority Having Jurisdiction.
These requirements shall follow State of Vermont Fire Prevention Division Directive 90-3. This
can be found as an appendix to this set of standards.
(q) LIABILITY. The City of Barre, or any of its employees, shall under no circumstance to held
liable for the failure of any of the equipment to operate during the transmission of an alarm to the
Fire Alarm Console, but it is understood that this department will do all that is possible to render
trouble free reliable service.
(r) APPENDIX TO THIS SET OF STANDARDS. This directive supersedes the November 9,
1988 directive 89-2. NFPA 101 1988 edition provides requirements for emergency forces
notification under section 7-6.4 and 7-7.2.3 for fire alarm and sprinkler systems, and as specified
3/8/2010 ORDINANCES
- 608 -
in the occupancy chapter.
Please find attached a summary of where emergency notification is required from NFPA 101 as
broken down by occupancy chapter.
As required by these sections, fire alarm and sprinkler systems must be connected in a manner to
automatically notify outside assistance. In reality, as Vermont is a rural state with few fire
departments capable of handling and receiving direct alarms, each installation needs to be looked
at on it's own merit. The connection must be by the best means available.
Listed in order by the most acceptable to least acceptable connection method:
1. Fire Department Master Box.
2. Leased direct line to the Fire Department.
3. Leased direct line to the Police Department or dispatching agency for the Fire
Department.
4. Approved Central Station.
5. Proprietary System.
6. Recognized remote station.
7. Digital dialer connected to approved remote station.
8. Tape Dialer.
For full time departments with the capability to receive master alarm boxes or direct alarm lines,
then the connection must be made to the Fire Department and the building owner does not have
the option to use a less effective connection. However, with a rural volunteer fire department it
may very well be acceptable to use an alternative, as listed above, in order of priority.
Section 7-6.4 is enforced by the Fire Prevention Division, but you should coordinate closely with
the local Fire Department to insure their concerns are met.

Chapter 23 – VACANT BUILDINGS OR ABANDONED PROPERTY
New Chapter Added Ord. No. 2009-02, 09-08-09; 2019-03, 06-15-2019
Sec. 23-1. Authority.
a. The City Council has enacted this ordinance under the authority granted to the City in Title
24 Vermont Statutes Annotated (V.S.A.), Chapter 61, §§2291(13), (14), and (15), and
Chapter 83, §§3113-3118, to compel the cleaning and repair of premises and to identify
and abate public nuisances.
Sec. 23-2. Statement of Findings.
a. Buildings that are vacant or vacant in a state of disrepair are public nuisances in that they
contribute to the decrease in value of surrounding properties, precipitate disinvestment by
neighboring owners, provide a location for criminal activity, undermine the aesthetic
character of the street and city and have other undesirable effects.
b. Allowing buildings to remain indefinitely vacant even in the absence of code violations or
boarding is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare; unreasonably interferes
with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other property within the
neighborhood; may pose a danger to first responders in an emergency; and detracts from
the appearance and good order of the neighborhood.
c. Owners of multiple buildings, either concurrently or serially, that are vacant and a nuisance
to the community are a significant problem in the City. Owners of buildings who fail to
correct deficiencies contribute to the decline of neighborhoods to a greater extent than those
who own only one building. It is in the interest of the welfare of neighborhoods that owners
of properties who fail to maintain properties and correct vacant buildings are subject to
imposition of higher administrative penalties in order to encourage these owners to correct
violations of this ordinance in a prompt manner.
Sec. 23-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this Ordinance, is, therefore to:
a. Identify, evaluate and reevaluate buildings and/or structures that have become vacant or
abandoned, becoming public nuisances, and the risks associated with them.
b. Define and document the responsibilities of the vacant building owners by providing
standards for maintaining vacant buildings.
c. Provide a monitoring program for those public nuisances.
d. Abate such public nuisances, and to mitigate their impacts.

buildings shall require a Vacant Building Registration, and follow all other requirements
in accordance with this Ordinance.
Sec. 23-5. Designation of Effect.
a. This ordinance shall constitute a civil ordinance within the meaning of 24 V.S.A. Chapter
59.
Sec. 23-6. Severability.
a. If any portion of this Ordinance is found to be unconstitutional or invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected and shall
remain in full force and effect. If any statute referred to in this ordinance is amended, this
ordinance shall be deemed to refer to such amended statute.
Sec. 23-7. Relationship with Other Laws or Regulations.
a. If any provision of this ordinance is more restrictive than any other law or regulation, the
provision of this ordinance will apply and take precedence.
b. If any provision of another law or regulation is more restrictive than this ordinance, the
provision of this ordinance will be superseded and the more restrictive provision will apply.
Sec. 23-8. Disclaimer of Liability.
a. This Ordinance does not create any liability on the part of the City, its officials, agents,
employees or representatives for damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or
any lawful administrative action or decision taken under this Ordinance.
Sec. 23-9. Effective Date of Ordinance.
a. Upon adoption by the City Council, this Ordinance and any subsequent amendments will
take effect in accordance with the procedures established in the Barre City Charter and
shall remain in effect until repealed or amended.
Sec. 23-10. Applicability, Exceptions.

premises located within the City of Barre, Vermont.

Zoning Administrator lawfully issued a zoning permit before the Barre City Council adopted
or amended this ordinance, an applicant will not need a new or amended permit for the
project. If such an applicant does not substantially complete the development or receive an
extension before that permit expires, the applicant will need to apply for a new zoning
permit, including any development approvals as applicable, under the ordinance as in effect
at the time of the new application.
1202.B Prior Zoning Permits for Phased Projects. If an applicant received approval for a phased
project before the Barre City Council adopted or amended this ordinance, the Zoning
Administrator will issue permits for the development as approved irrespective of any
change in this ordinance. However, if such an applicant does not substantially complete the
phased project as a whole within the timeframe specified in the approval, the applicant will
need to apply for a new zoning permit, including any development approvals as applicable,
under the ordinance as in effect at the time of the new application.
1202.C Prior Development Approvals. If an applicant does not obtain a zoning permit for
proposed development, other than a subdivision, that the Development Review Board
approved within 12 months of receiving that development approval, the approval will
expire and the applicant will need to apply for a new approval under the ordinance as in
effect at the time of the new application. (Note: An applicant may request a delay in effect
for a zoning permit and/or development approval in accordance with Subsection 4203.B.)
1202.D Lawfully Recorded Subdivision Plats. If an applicant lawfully recorded an approved
subdivision plat in the Barre City land records, that plat will remain valid and will not expire
irrespective of any change in this ordinance.
1202.E Effect of Change in Ownership. Zoning permits and development approvals remain valid
irrespective of any change in ownership of the property.

under the same definition in Section 2115 (e.g., a personal service use like a barber shop to
a restaurant use like a coffee shop).
1203.B Change within a Use Definition. A landowner will not need to obtain a zoning permit or
development approval for a change of use if both uses fall under the same definition in
Section 2115 (e.g., a retail sales use like a clothing store to a retail sales use like a home
furnishings store). Other development associated with the change of use may require a

approvals as applicable, to expand a non-residential use to occupy additional space in a
building or on a lot.
1204.B Residential Uses. A landowner will not need to obtain a zoning permit to expand a
residential use to occupy existing space in the building provided the number of bedrooms
will not increase. The landowner must obtain a zoning permit, and any development
approvals as applicable, to increase the number of bedrooms in a dwelling unit.
1205 Discontinued Uses
1205.A Nonresidential Uses. A landowner must obtain a zoning permit, and any development
approvals as applicable, to resume the use of a vacant non-residential site or structure if the
prior non-residential use has been discontinued for more than 12 months except:
(1) If the landowner has had to discontinue a non-residential use as result of damage to
the structure in which it is housed, the owner may re-establish the use once the
structure has been repaired or rebuilt in accordance with Section 1207. If the use is
nonconforming, see Section 1302.
(2) The Zoning Administrator may extend the period of discontinuance for a
conforming use to a total of not more than 3 years if the landowner demonstrates
that he/she is actively marketing the property or business for sale or lease. If the
use is nonconforming, see Section 1302.
1205.B Residential Uses. A landowner will not need to obtain a zoning permit to resume the use of
a vacant residential structure or unit provided there is no increase in the number of bedrooms
in the dwelling unit.
1206 Abandoned Development
1206.A If development is not completed prior to the expiration of the zoning permit authorizing the
development, a landowner must demolish or secure any partially completed structures,
remove all structural materials from the site, restore the site to a natural grade, and reestablish
groundcover to prevent erosion prior to the zoning permit expiring.

BARRE CITY UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE 2. Zoning Districts
Effective July 16, 2019; revised 8/20/19; 1/07/20 220. Overlay Districts
40
220 OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
2201 Design Review Overlay District
2201.A Intent. The Design Review overlay district establishes more rigorous urban design
standards and a higher level of review of proposed development in those areas of the city
recognized as having particular historical, architectural and/or cultural value in order to
ensure that any exterior modifications to existing structures and new construction will be
compatible with and maintain or enhance the character of the surrounding built
environment.
2201.B Allowed Uses. The use standards of the base zoning district will apply to a lot within this
overlay district.
2201.C Dimensional Standards. The dimensional standards of the base zoning district will apply
to a lot within this overlay district.
2201.D General Design Standards for New Principal Buildings. Unless otherwise specified in
this ordinance, the standards below apply to the design and construction of new principal
buildings in this overlay district (such development will also be subject to the requirements
of Barre City’s building code):
(1) Building Form. Buildings must have a multi-faceted exterior form in which
articulated facades are combined with window and door placement, as well as other
architectural detailing, including use of multiple exterior materials, to create
interesting and attractive designs as shown in the examples below. This standard is
intended to limit flat walls with minimal features.
(2) Building Massing and Height. Buildings must maintain an overall scale similar to
that of surrounding buildings or be designed to appropriately transition from areas
of higher intensity and larger-scale buildings to areas of lower intensity and
smaller-scale buildings as shown in the examples below. Outside the Urban Center
1 district, buildings that are more than 3 stories in height that abut the residential
districts must use design elements that reduce the apparent building mass as
viewed from the street (ex., setback for upper floors) and must step down in height
as necessary to provide an appropriate transition.
BARRE CITY UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE 2. Zoning Districts
Effective July 16, 2019; revised 8/20/19; 1/07/20 220. Overlay Districts
41
3-story building steps down to 2 stories as it
approaches a residential neighborhood.
(3) Alignment of Attached Buildings. Windowsills, moldings, and cornices on
attached buildings must align to the maximum extent feasible given the terrain, preexisting
building pattern and the need to raise structures to comply with flood
regulations.
(4) Façade Size. Buildings with street-facing façades that exceed 48 feet in width must
be divided into distinct “modules” defined by visible changes in façade elevation
through the use of wall plane projections, piers, columns, colonnades, arcades or
similar architectural features as shown in the examples below.
(5) Building Arrangement. If the site will have more than one building, the buildings
must be arranged so that they relate to one another and are aligned parallel to the
street or around a common open space such as a courtyard, green, square or plaza.
(6) Mechanical Equipment. Mechanical equipment, electrical meter and service
components, and similar utility devices, whether ground level, wall mounted, or
roof mounted, must be located to the side or rear of the principal building and
screened from view at the front property line. Such structures may be screened by
the principal building, by vegetation in accordance with Subsection 3106.F or by an
enclosure designed to be compatible with the architectural character and
predominant exterior materials of the principal building.
2201.E Specific Design Standards for New Non-Residential and Mixed-Use Buildings. Unless
otherwise specified in this ordinance, the standards below apply to the design and
BARRE CITY UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE 2. Zoning Districts
Effective July 16, 2019; revised 8/20/19; 1/07/20 220. Overlay Districts
42
construction of new non- residential or mixed-use buildings in this overlay district (such
development will also be subject to the requirements of Barre City’s building code):
(1) Building Structure. Buildings that are more than 2 stories in height must
incorporate a base, a middle, and a cap as follows (see examples below):
(a) The base must include an entryway with transparent windows as
specified in Paragraph (4) below and a molding or reveal placed
between the first and second stories or over the second story with a
depth of at least 2 inches and a height of at least 4 inches.
(b) The middle may include windows and/or balconies.
(c) The cap (the area from the top floor to the roof of the building) must
include a cornice or a roof overhang.
(2) Principal Entrance. All buildings must have a principal entrance on each streetfacing
façade that:
(a) Opens to a street, plaza or sidewalk. The principal entrance must not open
onto a parking lot.
(b) Is accessible from the public sidewalk and from any on-site parking areas via
a pedestrian walkway with an improved surface.
(c) Is aligned with the sidewalk elevation. Sunken terraces or stairways to below
grade stories are allowed but will not constitute entryways for the purposes
of this section.
(3) Street Wall. In the Urban Center 1 district, the front building wall or a courtyard
must adjoin the sidewalk along the full width of the front lot line except that not
more than a total of 28 feet along the front lot line may be used to provide vehicular
or pedestrian access to the rear of the lot.
BARRE CITY UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE 2. Zoning Districts
Effective July 16, 2019; revised 8/20/19; 1/07/20 220. Overlay Districts
43
(4) Windows and Entryways. The street-facing façade of buildings must conform to
all of the following:
(a) The ground floor must be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian
-scale activity by the use of windows and doors arranged so that the uses
occupying the first-floor street frontage are visible and/or accessible from the
sidewalk.
(b) At least 60% and not more than 90% of the ground floor elevation (as
measured from the sidewalk to the finished ceiling of the ground floor and
across the entire facade) must be public entrances and windows as shown in
the examples below. Within the Urban Center 1 district, this will be
interpreted to include only transparent windows that provide views into the
interior of the building. Within other districts, windows that are obscured in
a manner that can easily be reversed may be included in this calculation.
(c) Doors must be recessed into the face of the building or be covered to provide
a protected entryway not less than 15 square feet in area as shown in the
examples below.
(d) Canopies, awnings and similar appurtenances may be constructed at the
entrance to any building and may extend over the public sidewalk upon the
approval of the Director of Public Works.
2201.F Waiver of Standards for Industrial or Civic Buildings. An applicant may request a waiver
of one or more general design standards for a new industrial or civic building. The applicant
must demonstrate that the standard(s) interferes with the intended functional use of the
structure and that the proposed design meets the overall purpose and specific intents of
this ordinance.
2201.G Exterior Modifications and Additions to Existing Buildings. An applicant proposing
BARRE CITY UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE 2. Zoning Districts

(iii) To bring a non-historic structure into greater conformance with
the design standards in Subsections D and E above.
(b) Additions must be designed with windows and doors that are compatible
with the original portion of the building in terms of pattern, location,
dimensions and design unless that would result in the proposed design not
meeting the standards in Subsections D and E above.
(c) Shutters must be designed and sized to cover half the window opening and
must be mounted so that they would or would appear to be functional.
(2) Windows and Doors, Historic Structures
(a) Any replacement of windows or doors on a historic structure must be in kind
with a unit that matches the dimensions, design and appearance of the original
except that modifications may be allowed as necessary to meet accessibility
or code requirements.
(b) Storm windows and doors must not obscure the characteristics of historic
windows and doors.
(3) Roofs, All Structures
(a) Original rooflines must be retained and not be obscured by additions except
that modifications may be allowed:
(i) To rehabilitate a historic structure that has been altered back to its
original design,
(ii) Where the modifications will not be visible from the street, or
(iii) To bring a non-historic structure into greater conformance with the

that it may serve to provide access to proposed development.
3003 Adult Entertainment
3003.A Purpose. The purpose of this section is to mitigate the adverse secondary impacts
associated with adult entertainment facilities while not unduly limiting freedom of speech
and expression. Restrictions on the location and operation of such facilities are necessary
to protect residential neighborhoods, civic institutions and public gathering places from
the adverse secondary impacts associated with adult entertainment facilities including,
but not limited to, crime, nuisance, disturbance of public order and indecency, and to
protect public health, safety and welfare.
3003.B Use Standards. Adult entertainment uses may be allowed with conditional use

allowed (permitted or conditional) in the applicable zoning district.
(2) Adult entertainment uses must not be located within 600 feet of an existing grade
school, library, daycare facility, religious facility or public park. This distance will be
measured from the property line of the subject lot to the nearest property line of the
lot housing one of the listed uses. If a grade school, library, daycare facility, religious
facility or public park subsequently locates within 600 feet of a lawfully existing
adult entertainment use, this provision will not be used to eliminate or restrict that
adult entertainment use.
(3) Adult entertainment uses not located within the same building must be separated
from one another by at least 1,000 feet. This distance will be measured from the
property line of the subject lot to the nearest property line of another lot housing an
adult entertainment use.
(4) An adult entertainment use must not have any sign or other display visible from a
public vantage point depicting or portraying specified anatomical areas or specified
sexual activities.
(5) Adult oriented merchandise must not be displayed in a location that would be
visible from a public vantage point.

3014 Erosion Control
3014.A Purpose. This section is intended to promote construction practices on development and
redevelopment sites that limit soil disturbance and compaction, and minimize erosion and
sedimentation of downstream water bodies.
3014.B Applicability. All construction activities that will disturb soil must implement appropriate
measures to prevent erosion and sedimentation from adversely impacting nearby
properties, public infrastructure or downstream water bodies as set forth in the general
standards below. The provisions of this section apply to any development that will disturb
soil except:
(1) Development that obtains a state construction general or individual permit will be
assumed to have met the requirements of this section. Any zoning permit or
approval will be conditional upon the applicant submitting a copy of the state
permit to the Zoning Administrator prior to the start of construction.
3014.C Erosion Control Plan Required. Applicants must submit and implement a professionally
prepared erosion control plan for construction activities that will disturb more than 10,000
square feet of soil in accordance with the Vermont Standards and Specifications for Erosion
Prevention and Sediment Control.
3014.D General Standards. All construction activities that will disturb soil must be undertaken in
accordance with the following practices (for further guidance see the Vermont Agency of
Natural Resource’s Low Risk Site Handbook for Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control):
(1) Limit the size of the construction area to the minimum necessary to accommodate
the proposed development.
(2) Preserve significant existing trees within the construction area where feasible.
Trees to be preserved within the construction area should be protected by fencing
that at a minimum encloses the area around their drip line.
(3) Mark site boundaries to identify the limits of construction (including storage and
access areas) with flags or fencing. No soil disturbance or compaction should occur
outside the delineated construction area.
(4) Limit the amount of soil exposed at one time to reduce the potential for erosion by
phasing construction.
(5) Stabilize and maintain the construction entrance to prevent mud from being tracked
onto streets.
(6) Install silt fences to intercept runoff and allow suspended sediment to settle out on
the downslope side of construction activities and between disturbed soil and any
drainage feature, stormwater inlet or water body.
(7) Divert any stormwater from upslope areas around the disturbed area with
appropriately stabilized berms and/or ditches to prevent the runoff from picking
up sediment. Untreated stormwater and sediment must not be diverted to

3102.C General Standards. All outdoor lighting must conform to the following:
(1) Lighting Plan. Applicants for major site plan approval (see Subsection 4305.C)
must submit a lighting plan prepared by a professional lighting engineer or designer
if outdoor lighting will be altered or installed.
(2) Shielding. All nonexempt outdoor light fixtures must be shielded as specified in
Figure 3-5 or Figure 3-6 or as applicable. All fixtures that are required to be fully
shielded must be installed and maintained in such a manner that the shielding is
effective.
(3) Total Output. Total output from all light fixtures on a site must not exceed the limits
specified in Figure 3-5 or Figure 3-6 as applicable.
(4) Uniformity. Outdoor lighting must be designed to provide a uniform distribution of
light in areas regularly traversed by vehicles or pedestrians. Lighting plans that
produce a ratio of 3:1 or less between the highest light level and lowest light level
within a trafficked area on the site are strongly encouraged and ratios in excess of
10:1 are prohibited.
(5) Spot Light Aiming. Light fixtures containing spot or flood lamps must be aimed no
higher than 45° above straight down. When aimed straight down, such light fixtures
will be considered fully shielded; when aimed above straight down, they will be
considered partially shielded. Use of flood or similar high-intensity lighting is
discouraged.
(6) Freestanding Lights. Freestanding light fixtures must not exceed 30 feet in height
in the Industrial and General Business districts and 24 feet in height in all other
districts. Freestanding light fixtures may be located within setbacks. Use of
decorative fixtures not more than 12 feet in height is encouraged to light walkways
and other pedestrian - oriented spaces.
(7) Light Trespass. Outdoor light fixtures must be oriented and shielded as necessary
to prevent light trespass over adjacent property or rights-of-way.
(8) Internally Illuminated Architecture. The initial lamp output of any architectural
element (ex. wall, fascia or canopy edge) that is internally illuminated will be
considered partially shielded, Class 3 lighting.
(9) Luminous Tube Lighting. Luminous tube lighting does not require shielding but it
will be considered partially shielded lighting for the purposes of calculating total
outdoor light output for the site.
(10) Time Limits. Outdoor lighting must be extinguished as specified in Figure 3-5 or
Figure 3-6 as applicable unless otherwise approved by the Development Review
Board upon finding the lighting necessary to protect public safety or secure the

Municipal Plan;
2. To be in accordance with §4411(b)(3)(G) and §4424 of the Act as amended;
3. To minimize and prevent loss of life and property, the disruption of commerce, the
impairment of the tax base, and the extraordinary public expenditures and
demands on public services that result from flood by:
a. Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health, safety
or property in times of flood or cause excessive increase in flood
heights or velocities;
b. Requiring that the design and construction of development in the
flood hazard areas is accomplished in a manner that minimizes or
eliminates the potential for flood damage; and
c. Requiring the elevation of all structures to a level above the base
flood elevation for all new development.
4. To manage all flood hazard areas designated pursuant to 10 V.S.A. §753;
5. To make wise use of open land in flood prone areas;
6. To make the City of Barre as well as its residents and property owners eligible for
Federal Flood Insurance.
7. To further the purposes of the Act described under 24 V.S.A. §4302 and to be in
accordance with the policies set forth therein. [§4401]
1.05 Interpretation and Effect
(A) All uses and structures legally in existence as of the effective date of these regulations are
allowed to continue indefinitely. Any subsequent development related to pre-existing
structures and uses shall be subject to applicable requirements of these regulations.
(B) These regulations shall not repeal, abrogate, or impair any other land use controls
including but not limited to statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances, permits, easements,
deed restrictions, and covenants. The provisions of these regulations, however, shall be
minimum requirements and shall therefore take precedence over any concurrent and less
restrictive controls [§4413(c)].
(C) The issuance of a permit under these regulations shall not relieve the applicant from the
obligation of obtaining any other local permits or necessary approvals by federal or state
law.
(D) All permits and decisions in these regulations are made with respect to property location
and these permits and decisions run with the land. Similarly, enforcement of violations of
these regulations is applied to the owner of the property where the violation occurs and
said violations will run with the land.

9
10
11
12
13
14
(A) An applicant may receive relief from a provision of these Flood Hazard Area regulations
through the granting of a variance by the DRB. Variances may be granted for general
structures and renewable energy structures, under separate criteria, with additional flood
hazard area variance standards. Variances to allow uses that are not permitted in the
applicable district are not permissible. [§4469]
(B) Purpose: The purpose of a variance is to address a hardship, related to the physical
characteristics of a particular lot, which hampers the owner from enjoying the same
property rights accorded to others in the Flood Hazard Area district. An applicant cannot
request rights, which have not been accorded to all others in the same district. Therefore, in
no case shall the DRB grant a variance for a use which is not permitted in the Flood Hazard
Area district. Because a variance results in a deviation from the City Plan and regulations,
variances are allowed only in narrow circumstances.
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
(C) Application and procedure: Variances are treated as appeals [§§4465, 4466], therefore an
application for a variance shall follow the procedures established in 3.01(B)-(G).
23
24
25
(D) Variance Standards: General structures and renewable energy structures are considered
under separate standards [§4469] with regards to variances. Regardless of the type of
structure, every variance must meet additional flood hazard area variance requirements [44
CFR, Section 60.6].
26
27
28
29
30
1. General structures. The DRB may render a decision in favor of the applicant only
upon establishing all of the following facts below and those in subsection (3) in its
decision [§4469]:

a. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created
by the provisions of the Flood Hazard Area regulation in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located; and
b. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity
with the provisions of the flood hazard area regulation and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property; and
c. That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant; and
d. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character

of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located,
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable
energy resources, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
e. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible
from the flood hazard area regulation and from the city plan.
2. Renewable energy structures. For a structure which is primarily a renewable energy
resource structure, the DRB may render a decision in favor of the applicant only
upon establishing all of the following facts and those in subsection (3) in its
decision [§4469]:

17

22
23
24
25
a. It is unusually difficult or unduly expensive for the appellant to build
a suitable renewable energy resource structure in conformance with
these regulations; and
b. That the hardship was not created by the appellant; and
c. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located,
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable
resources, nor be a detriment to the public welfare; and
d. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible
from the flood hazard area regulations and from the city plan.
3. Flood hazard area. For any structure in flood hazard area, the DRB may render a
decision in favor of the applicant only upon establishing all of the facts identified in
subsection (1) or (2) above, as applicable, and the following facts in its decision:

a. For projects within the regulatory floodway, that during the base
flood discharge, the variance will not result in increased flood levels.
b. For parcels of one-half acre or less in size which are also contiguous
to and surrounded by parcels with existing structures constructed
below the base flood elevation, the following variance standards
apply:
i. Demonstration of good and sufficient cause;
ii. Determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
iii. Determination that the granting the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimize the public, or
conflict with other local ordinances; and
iv. That the variance, if approved, is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
c. While the granting of variances is generally limited to a parcel size of
less than one-half acre in size (see subsection (b) above), deviations
from that limit may occur. However, as the parcel size increases

beyond one-half acre, the technical justification for issuing a variance
increases.
d. For variances necessary to allow for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use the following standards apply:
i. The standards identified in subsection (b); and
ii. Determination that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety.
(E) Mandatory Condition of Variance Approval: In addition to any other conditions the DRB may
attach through the procedures established in Section 3.01(E), every permit issued for any
variance within the Flood Hazard Area shall state:
11
12
13
14
15 “This development is not in conformance with the Flood Hazard Area
16 regulations established by the City of Barre to protect the health, safety and
17 welfare of the occupants and/or property. This development will be
18 maintained at the risk of the owner. The issuance of this variance to develop
19 in the flood hazard area will result in increased premium rates for flood
20 insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and
21 may increase risks to life and property in the event of a flood.”
22
23 3.03 Appeals to Environmental Court
24
(A) Applicability: An interested person who has participated in the local regulatory proceeding
under these regulations may appeal a decision of the DRB to the Environmental Court
[§4471]. Participation in a local regulatory proceeding shall consist of offering, through oral

without commencement shall be deemed expired and may be subject to enforcement
action.
1. Once legally commenced, all construction must be complete within a period of sixty
(60) months from the effective date of the permit. A permit in which the deadline
has lapsed without completion shall be deemed expired and may be subject to
enforcement action.
2. Where an applicant would like to develop based on an expired permit, reapplication
for a new Flood Hazard Area Development permit, including any associated
approvals, is required. If appropriate, the Administrative Officer may find the
incomplete development in violation of these regulations and action may be taken.
3. Any Flood Hazard Area Development permit issued based on material inaccuracies
or misrepresentations in an application or in any supporting documentation to an
application shall be null and void; and any associated development activity
commenced under such permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations
subject to enforcement.
4. A permit for a use which has been abandoned is not a valid permit.
(R) Conditions of Flood Hazard Area Development Permits. Except as described below, there is

1. A Certificate of Flood Hazard Compliance is not required for permits issued for nonsubstantial
improvements where the improvements only relate to these regulations
for substantial improvement calculations.
a. For example, a non-substantial renovation of a third floor kitchen in
the flood hazard area requires a permit but will not require a
Certificate of Flood Hazard Compliance because the kitchen
improvements are tracked only as a measure of substantial
improvement of the entire structure. On the other hand a nonsubstantial
renovation of a garage with the floor below BFE will
require but the permit and certificate of compliance because the
garage renovations are material to the flood hazard regulations.
b. The Administrative Officer shall determine at the time of issuance of
the permit whether a Certificate of Flood Hazard Compliance will be
required.
(S) Posting and Recording Requirements: The Administrative Officer shall meet the posting and
recording requirements of section 2.05.

(A) Applicability. Where development constitutes a substantial improvement to an existing
structure, the existing structure shall be improved to NFIP standards and to the standards of
these regulations.
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
1. Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which either ‘equals or exceeds $50,000’ or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure, whichever is less, before the start of
construction. This term includes structures which have incurred “repetitive loss” or
“substantial damage”, regardless of actual work performed.
(B) Calculating Substantial Improvements. The following shall apply when calculating
substantial improvements:

34
1. Unless stricter rules are described in this section, FEMA NFIP guidance such as the
NFIP Flood Plain Management Requirements- Desk Reference shall be used to guide
calculation of market value of structure and costs.
2. Where one building is attached to another through a covered breezeway or similar
connection, the two buildings are considered separate and substantial improvement
calculations shall be made for each structure independently.
3. All improvements shall be counted cumulatively over 5 years to determine if a
substantial improvement of a structure has occurred.
a. Any non-permitted improvements discovered after the fact shall be
considered to have all occurred at the same time for purposes of
determining substantial improvements.
4. In general the City of Barre shall use the assessed value of the structure as the
default value of the structure.
(C) Substantial Improvements of Existing Structures. The following shall apply to govern
structures that are substantially improved:

41
42
43
44
45
46
47
1. Where an application proposes to make a substantial improvement to an existing
structure, that structure shall be brought into conformance with these regulations.
For example a structure with the lowest floor below BFE may be required to elevate
the structure.
2. Where one structure is attached to another through a covered breezeway or similar
connection, it is a separate structure and not an addition. Therefore, substantial
improvement of a structure would require the elevation of the structure and all
additions but not separate structures.
Flood Hazard Area Regulations for the City of Barre (2010)

28
1. Where a proposal is determined to be a non-substantial improvement only the
improvement will be reviewed for conformance with these regulations.
2. Non-substantial improvements to existing structures apply to existing structures on
their existing footprints. Additions to structures must be compliant with all relevant
requirements of these regulations.
(E) The term ‘substantial improvement’ does not include the following:
1. The cost of improvements of a structure to correct existing violations of state and
local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the
local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions;
2. Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure. The Administrative Officer
may request from the applicant a Section 106 report, prepared by a qualified
professional, to demonstrate compliance with this provision.
a. This exemption does not apply to additions (i.e. expansions of
building footprint) to historic structures which must be built in
compliance with these regulations.

hazard area, including the location of sub-district boundaries, by visual inspection
of the Official Flood Hazard Area map or by scaling distances on the Official Flood
Hazard Area map, as appropriate.
2. When the Administrative Officer cannot definitely determine the location of a
district or sub-district boundary line by the above rule, the Administrative Officer
shall determine the boundary line in question based upon surveys provided by the
applicant and/or other evidence including input from the State Department of
Environmental Conservation.
(B) Delineation of Flood Hazard Area Including Floodway and Fringe Sub-Districts in Zone A.
When interpreting the boundaries of districts in Zone A on the Official Flood Hazard Area
Map, the Administrative Officer shall follow the rules below. Floodway delineations are
required in Zone A for development of new structures and expansions of footprints of
existing structures.

hazard area by visual inspection of the Official Flood Hazard Area map or by scaling
distances on the Official Flood Hazard Area map, as appropriate.
2. The Administrative Officer shall determine the boundaries of the floodway based on
evidence presented by the applicant. The applicant shall submit evidence to the
Administrative Officer which may include surveys and/or other evidence including
input from the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
(C) When determining whether an existing or proposed structure is in or out of a flood hazard
area, the entire structure including all additions shall be considered to be within the flood
hazard area if any portion of the structure is within the flood hazard area. When
determining the sub-district of an existing or proposed structure, the entire structure shall
be considered to be within the most restrictive sub-district in which it touches.
1. Where one structure is attached to another through a covered breezeway or similar
connection, it is a separate structure and not an addition.
(D) Where an applicant believes the property or structure in question is outside of the flood
hazard area and therefore not subject to these regulations, the applicant shall request a
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), as applicable, from
FEMA (see section 10 of these regulations).

maps or by scaling distances on the FIRM or FBFM maps, as appropriate. Where
necessary to meet required accuracy, elevations shall be determined by
interpolation between two base flood elevation lines.
2. Determinations shall be made based on the highest base flood elevation, within the
flood hazard area, for the structure in question. A building, therefore, which has a
BFE at the north end of 600.5 feet and a BFE of 602.1 feet at the south end of the
building, will have a BFE of 602.1 for the entire building.
(C) Determining Base Flood Elevations in A Zone. In areas where base flood elevations have

(A) Any legal structure or part thereof, which is not conforming to the provisions of these
regulations concerning any structural requirements (including such things as lowest floor
elevation) shall be deemed a non-conforming structure [§4412(7)]. Legal non-conforming
structures exist as a result of construction prior to adoption of regulations, construction
under an earlier set of less restrictive regulations, or through a variance issued at any time.
(B) Any non-conforming structure may be allowed to exist indefinitely, but shall be subject to
the following provisions:
1. A non-conforming structure within the Flood Hazard Area that is proposed to be
substantially improved must have the entire structure brought into compliance with
these regulations (see Section 5.01 on substantial improvements).
2. A non-conforming structure within the Flood Hazard Area that has been demolished,
destroyed, or substantially damaged which is proposed for redeveloped must be
redeveloped in accordance with these regulations [§4424(2)] (see Section 5.02
regarding substantial damage).
3. A non-conforming structure shall not be moved without being brought into
compliance with these regulations.
4. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair
of a non-conforming structure provided that such action does not qualify as a
substantial improvement or substantial damage of the structure and that such action
does not increase the degree of non-conformance.
5. All additions to non-conforming structures shall be developed in accordance with
these regulations (see section 5.01 regarding substantial improvements).

demonstration must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles and certified by a professional engineer.
2. Beyond the additional requirement above in Section 9.02(A)(1), development shall
meet the same requirements as if the proposal were in Zone AE (Section 9.03 for
development in the floodway and Section 9.04 for development in the floodway
fringe) except that, within the floodway fringe portion of Zone A, non-residential
uses shall be elevated (Section 9.04(A)(2)(a)). Dry proofing (Section 9.04(A)(2)(b))
is prohibited in Zone A.

1. Development within the floodway sub-district may be approved provided the
applicant provides a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, performed by a registered
engineer in accordance with standard engineering practices, certifying that the
proposed development will not:
a. result in any increase in flood levels (0.00 feet) during the
occurrence of the base flood; and
b. increase any risk to surrounding properties, facilities, or structures
from erosion or flooding.
2. In addition to provisions regulating substantial improvements (see Section 5)
existing encroachments in the floodway may be altered or modified as described
below:
a. Where the proposed development does not increase the exterior
dimensions (i.e. footprint) of the structure, development may be
approved without a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis provided the
structure meets the requirements under section 9.04 of these
regulations.
3. Landfilling, parking recreational vehicles (See Section 8.16), junkyards, and storage
areas or facilities for floatable materials, chemicals, explosives, flammable liquids, or
other hazardous or toxic materials are strictly prohibited within the floodway.
4. Public utilities may be placed underground and the hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses may be waived, where a registered professional engineering certifies that
there will be no change in grade and the utilities will be adequately protected from
scour.
43 9.04 Zone AE-Floodway Fringe Sub-District Regulations
44
(A) Review Standards for Development in Zone AE-Floodway Fringe: Development within the
floodway fringe is regulated based on the classification of use- either residential or nonresidential:

21
a. The lowest floor, including basement, of all new and substantially
improved structures shall be at least one foot above the base flood
elevation. This can be achieved in one of three ways:
i. Elevated on fill. This is typical for slab construction or
where structures are to be placed at grade and tied
down. This is not an appropriate technique for
primary structures due to the risk of scour and
erosion undermining the structure.
ii. Elevated on piles, posts, piers or columns. This
technique is typically used in areas with high velocity.
iii. Elevated on walls or a crawlspace. The third
technique is to build on solid walls (i.e. slab on stem
wall foundation or elevate building over crawlspace).
b. Unless stricter rules are described in this section, FEMA NFIP
guidance such as the NFIP Flood Plain Management Requirements-
Desk Reference and FEMA 54- Elevated Residential Structures shall
be used to guide design and construction considerations.
2. Non-Residential structures. All development of non-residential structures shall meet
one of the following:
22
23
a. Elevation. Non-residential structures shall be elevated as required
above (section 9.04(B)(1)). This is the preferred alternative for all
structures. Where elevating the structure is not a viable option an
applicant may propose to dry-proof the structure as described in (b).
24
25
26
27
b. Dry-proofing. Non-residential structures, together with their
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, which are proposed to be
dry-proofed shall be designed to be watertight below the point one
foot above the base flood elevation with walls substantially
impermeable and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy.

shall not be issued until a registered engineer or
architect has certified that the design and proposed
methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the
provisions of this subsection.
3. Fully enclosed areas below lowest floor. All development which has fully enclosed
areas that are below base flood elevation may be permitted provided:

43
44
45
46
47
48
a. These areas are solely used for parking vehicles, storage, or
structure access.

minimum criteria:
i. A minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of
not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
ii. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1
foot above grade.
iii. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings provided that they permit
the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
4. Storage of materials and equipment. Junkyards are strictly prohibited from the
floodway fringe. Storage of floatable, hazardous, or toxic materials is permitted only
when the material or tank is anchored to a pad that has been filled and graded to at
least one foot above the base flood elevation.

(A) As a part of FEMAs responsibility in implementing the NFIP, three procedures have been
established to address critical components of the program. The three types of applications
each have separate procedures for proposed and existing scenarios. The six Letters are:
1. Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A letter from FEMA stating that an existing
structure or parcel of land that has
9
not been elevated by fill would not be inundated
by the base flood. This is generally used for existing properties where it is believed
that the FIRM or FBFM map is incorrectly drawn therefore a structure or piece of
land is mapped as being in the Flood Hazard Area but upon review by a surveyor or
engineer it is found to above the base flood elevation.
10
11
12
13
14
15
16 2. Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA). A letter from FEMA stating
that a proposed structure that is not to be elevated by fill would not be inundated by
the base flood if built as proposed. This is used in similar situations as a LOMA
except that it involves proposed rather than existing structures or pieces of land.
17
18
19
20
21 3. Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). A letter from FEMA stating
that an existing structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by fill would not
be inundated by the base flood. This is generally required after an area in the Flood
Hazard Area has been filled, in accordance with FEMA construction standards,
resulting in land that is now above the base flood elevation.
22
23
24
25
26
27 4. Conditional Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (CLOMR-F). A letter from
FEMA stating that a parcel of land or proposed structure that will be elevated by fill
would not be inundated by the base flood if fill is placed on the parcel as proposed
or the structure is built as proposed. This is generally required by applicants seeking
to fill in the Flood Hazard Area to make it suitable for development.

5. Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A letter from FEMA officially revising the current
FIRM or FBFM map to show changes to the flood plains, floodways, or flood
elevations.
6. Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A letter from FEMA commenting
on whether a proposed project, if built as proposed, would meet minimum NFIP
standards or proposed hydrology changes. Similar to LOMR requests, these are
generally used with proposed changes to BFE determinations.
(B) It is the responsibility of the applicant to secure all required Letters from FEMA. Information
provided herein should not be interpreted to be the rules that FEMA will use. Always contact
FEMA for full details.

(A) Where FEMA approves a LOMA the proposal or structure shall no longer be considered to be
within the Flood Hazard Area and therefore no longer is required to meet the provisions of
these Flood Hazard Area Regulations.
(B) All LOMAs and CLOMAs, including final elevation certificates, shall be recorded by the
Administrative Officer according to section 2.05.

(A) Not all fill requires a LOMR-F. Only applications where the developer proposes to use fill to
remove the structure from the Flood Hazard Area.
(B) Filing CLOMR-F and LOMR-F applications. As a part of the CLOMR-F application, the
Community Acknowledgement Form (Form 3) must be included. The Administrative Officer
is required to sign this form and may, at his or her discretion, request comments from the
DRB prior to returning the form to the applicant.

1. Applicants are hereby informed that local requirements may be stricter than those
required by FEMA. Where an application for a CLOMR-F or LOMR-F is requested
which does not meet the stricter local requirements, the Administrative Officer shall
make such comments on the Form and return the application to the applicant.
(C) IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING CLOMA-F and LOMA-F. Approval of a CLOMA-F or
LOMA-F is not a substitute for a Flood Hazard Area Development permit. Approval of a
CLOMA-F or LOMA-F is evidence in an application for a Flood Hazard Area Development
permit. A Flood Hazard Area Development permit is required prior to any filling of the Flood
Hazard Area.
1. Once a CLOMR-F is approved by FEMA, a local application may be made to place fill
in the Flood Hazard Area. The Administrative Officer shall review the CLOMR-F to
ensure it meets the local regulations regarding filling of the Flood Hazard Area. Once
the applicant has received the Flood Hazard Area Development permit, then the
applicant may fill the flood hazard area as described in the permit.
2. Upon completion of the filling, the applicant must apply for the LOMR-F from FEMA
prior to any applications to develop the filled site. As a part of the application for the
LOMR-F, an elevation certificate is required.
3. Once FEMA approves the LOMR-F the proposal shall no longer be considered to be
within the Flood Hazard Area and therefore no longer is required to meet the
provisions of these Flood Hazard Area Regulations.
(D) All LOMR-Fs and CLOMR-Fs, including final elevation certificates, shall be recorded by the
Administrative Officer according to section 2.05.

change floodplain and floodway delineations or to alter or set base flood elevations at a
location. The applicant will still be required to meet all provisions of this regulation in pursuit
of the CLOMR or LOMR.
(B) Filing CLOMR and LOMR applications. As a part of the CLOMR application, the Community
Acknowledgement Form (Form 3) must be included. The Administrative Officer is required
to sign this form and may, at his or her discretion, request comments from the DRB prior to
returning the form to the applicant.

required by FEMA. Where an application for a CLOMR or LOMR is requested which
does not meet the stricter local requirements, the Administrative Officer shall make
such comments on the Form and return the application to the applicant.
(C) A permit cannot be issued for a project where a lower base flood elevation is proposed by a
CLOMR until the final LOMR has been issued. A permit can be issued for the portion of the
project not dependent on the changes that will result from the LOMR and condition the full
permit upon receipt of the final LOMR.
