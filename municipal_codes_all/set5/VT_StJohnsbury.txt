regardless of the assessment method.
The common area fees shall be established by the Commission upon approval of the
Commission Budget by the Board of Selectmen and shall be assessed annually by the

States and of this State, the Commission, with the approval of the Board of Selectmen,
may substitute any local option taxes permitted by law in lieu of common area fees that
exist to meet the Budget.

assessment or levy of common area fees may appeal the decision to the board of
Selectmen by filing a written notice of appeal with the Town Clerk within 30 days of the

parking spaces provided, number of parking spaces that would be needed to
conform to the Town's existing zoning bylaws for new construction, or any
equation which raises fees adequate to meet an annual Commission budget with a
method that reasonably apportions costs to property owners in relation to the
benefit that accrues to them.
The Commission shall only raise common area fees sufficient to meet
the budget regardless of the assessment method.
The common area fees shall be established by the Commission upon
approval of the Commission budget by the Selectboard and shall be assessed
annually by the Selectboard to be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as the Town votes to have its taxes collected, and such common area
assessment shall be a lien thereon with the same priority as taxes lawfully
assessed thereon.
(C) Consistent with the charter for the Town of St. Johnsbury and the laws
of the United States and of this State, the Commission, with the approval of the
Selectboard, may substitute any local option taxes permitted by law in lieu of
common area fees that exist to meet the budget.
(D) Appeals:
Persons aggrieved by any decision of the Commission involving the
assessment or levy of common area fees may appeal the decision to the
Selectboard by filing a written notice of appeal with the Town Clerk within 30 days
of the date of such decision, and furnishing a copy of the notice of appeal to the
Commission. The Selectboard shall set a date and place for a hearing on the
appeal within 60 days of the filing of the notice of appeal. The Selectboard shall

period send the appellant, and the Commission, by certified mail, a copy of the

TOWN OF ST. JOHNSBURY CODE OF
ORDINANCES
Published by Order of the Board of Selectmen, St. Johnsbury, VT
October 24, 2017

PREFACE
The Code of Ordinances in this booklet represents the complete re-codification of the ordinances of the
Town of St. Johnsbury, Vermont adopted November 9, 1992 of a general and permanent nature. This
booklet has been revised and re-formatted, and includes amendments adopted by the Select Board
since the original re-codification.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code also include the 1966 Code and Ordinances
subsequently adopted by the Board of Selectmen. The source of each section is included in the history
note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section
is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various
sections within each chapter have been catch lined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related
sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes.
Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash
referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section
within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-2 and the second section of
Chapter 3 is 3-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new
sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for
amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically
come between section 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1,
4-1.2 and 4-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is
to be included between Chapters 5 and 6, it will be designated as Chapter 5.5. Care should be taken that
the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and
new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of
the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division.
Indices
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still
others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross
references within each index which stands as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in
which he is interested.
Loose-leaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the loose-leaf
system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept upto-
date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and
the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders
of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the
obsolete pages.
iii
Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume.
As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the
publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and,
in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
The following copies of the Code shall be maintained:
The Town Clerk
The Town Manager
The Police Chief
The Fire Chief
The Director of Public Works
The Planning Commission (7 copies)
The Developmental Review Board (5 copies)
The Town Attorney
The Town Website

operating expenses, shall be paid by a tax on the grand list of each taxpayer therein for
his ratable share thereof, to be assessed annually by the selectmen to be collected at the

such tax assessed upon grand list shall be a lien thereon with the same priority as other
taxes lawfully assessed thereon.

Johnsbury and indebtedness that may be incurred from time to time for that area, the

Board, by order, transfers such jurisdiction to the commission, notwithstanding section 8 of the
charter, or amends the order or ordinance.
(3) Annual Budget:
Annually the commission shall submit to the Select Board for approval for the next fiscal year a
capital and operating budget of revenues and expenditures which shall be used exclusively to

commission in connection with the operation, maintenance and repair of the district. In the event

budget forthwith to the commission with its recommendations for the commission's
reconsideration. Appropriations other than from contributions, grants and income for the

tax on property as provided for in this subsection. The commission may, upon adoption of the
annual budget and upon approval of the Select Board, borrow money in anticipation of common

(A) Common area fees are charges levied upon the owners of taxable properties located in the
district, excepting such portions of properties used for owner occupied residential purposes.

district based upon one of the following assessment methods:

of square footages of commercial space, number of apartments, square footage of lot size,
linear footage of frontage, number of parking spaces provided, number of parking spaces
that would be needed to conform to the town's existing zoning bylaws for new
construction, or any equation which raises fees adequate to meet an annual commission
budget with a method that reasonably apportions costs to property owners in relation to
the benefit that accrues to them.
The commission shall only raise common area fees sufficient to meet the budget regardless of
the assessment method.
The common area fees shall be established by the commission upon approval of the commission
budget by the Select Board and shall be assessed annually by the Select Board to be collected at
the same time and in the same manner as the town votes to have its taxes collected, and such
common area assessment shall be a lien thereon with the same priority as taxes lawfully assessed
thereon.

(C) Consistent with the charter for the town of St. Johnsbury, and the laws of the United States
and of this state, the commission, with the approval of the Select Board, may substitute any local
option taxes permitted by law in lieu of common area fees that exist to meet the budget.
(D) Appeals: Persons aggrieved by any decision of the commission involving the assessment or
levy of common area fees may appeal the decision to the Select Board by filing a written notice
of appeal with the town clerk within 30 days of the date of such decision, and furnishing a copy

PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ORDINANCE25
Sec. 6-1 AUTHORITY.
This Ordinance is adopted by the Town of St. Johnsbury Select Board under authority
granted in 24 V.S.A. Ch. 11, §§ 25(a)(5), (a)(8) and 25(b), 24 V.S.A. §§ 2291(13), (14), and
(15), 24 V.S.A. § 2121, and 24 V.S.A. Chapter 59.
Sec. 6-2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
Being that there exist in the Town of St. Johnsbury structures, buildings and parcels of land
that have become dangerous or unsafe and numerous other structures that are vacant, abandoned,
and in disrepair, the St. Johnsbury Select Board finds and declares that:
(1) Structures that become dangerous and unsafe must promptly be made safe and secure to
protect the public safety and public safety personnel.
(2) Structures that are vacant and not properly secured are dangerous and unsafe in that they
are extremely vulnerable to being set on fire by unauthorized persons.
24 Cross reference-Animals, Ch. 3.
25 Article I is a new Ordinance adopted May 27, 2014. No petitions were filed.
40
(3) Many structures that are vacant, whether secured or not, are a blight on their
neighborhoods, cause deterioration and instability in their neighborhoods, and have an
adverse impact upon adjacent and nearby properties.
(4) Structures that were previously used as residential units and have since become vacant
have a significant and detrimental impact on the local housing market.
(5) Structures that are vacant and not properly secured attract vagrants and criminals and are
prime locations to conduct illegal activities, including arson and drug use.
(6) Structures that are vacant and unsecured pose serious threats to the public health and
safety and therefore are declared to be public nuisances.
(7) Quarterly abatement and rehabilitation of these structures is necessary to abate such
public nuisances, prevent unsightly blight and the deterioration of neighborhoods with
the consequent adverse impact on the value of adjacent and nearby properties, secure the
public safety and to ensure and enhance the vitality and livability of our neighborhoods.
(8) Communication between owners of dangerous and vacant buildings and the Town is
essential for effective allocation of public resources and the maintenance of public
health, welfare, and safety in regard to such structures.
The purpose of this article is to establish the reasonably necessary measures to abate the
public nuisances, blight, negative housing market impact, and other harmful effects connected
with dangerous and vacant or abandoned buildings, structures and lands, consistent with the
authority vested in the Town to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public through the
regulation of the construction, maintenance, repair, and alteration of buildings, structures and
properties within the Town.

Secs. 13-26--13-30. Reserved.
DIVISION 3. CAPACITY ALLOCATION
Sec. 13-31. Ownership & Permit
The Town owns and operates a sewage treatment plant and sewage works as defined in 24
V.S.A., § 3501(6) and 3601. The Plant has a permitted capacity, and is operated in accord with a
discharge permit issued by the Department under authority granted in 10 V.S.A., Chapter 47.
The Board is obligated by law to comply with conditions of that permit, and to operate and
manage the Plant and Sewage Works as governmental functions under and pursuant to 24
V.S.A., Chapters 97 and 101.
Sec. 13-32. Introduction to Reserve Capacity Allocation
(a) The permitted capacity of the Plant and Sewage Works is the property of the Town.
The uncommitted reserve capacity of the Plant and Sewage Works shall be allocated by the
Board in the manner described below. This ordinance is adopted in accordance with the
provisions of 24 V.S.A., § 3625, in the manner provided in No. 345 of the Acts of 1957 as
Amended, and shall not be construed as an abandonment or relinquishment of the authority or
responsibility of the Board to regulate, control and supervise all means and methods of
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal within the Town, nor shall it be construed to
impair or inhibit the ability of the Town to contract with persons for the collection, transmission
and treatment of wastewater.
(b) The Town has a design wastewater treatment plant capacity of 1.6 million gallons per
day and currently operates the treatment Plant at an average inflow (gallons) and wastewater
strength (pounds of BOD) per day as identified in the Plant operations reports published
124
monthly by the chief operator of the sewage treatment plant.
Sec. 13-33. Allocation Priorities
(a) All allocations to projects shall be based on the development wastewater flow and
strength. Any differential between actual and development wastewater flows and strength that
occurs is not available to the development owner for re-allotment to another project or a project
expansion.
(b) Allocation of uncommitted reserve capacity shall comply with reserve capacity policy
established by the Board to govern the gross allocation of reserve capacity before the allocation
principles are applied to specific projects.
(c) Residential, commercial, institutional and industrial facilities existing within the sewer
service area existing on the date of adoption of this Ordinance which are required to be
connected to the Town sewer by the provision hereof, or by virtue of existing pollution from the
facilities to waters of the State, shall be entitled to first priority in allocation of uncommitted
reserve capacity. New development within or outside the sewer service area will have second
priority of uncommitted reserve capacity provided that the development is in the best interest of
the Town. No allocation of reserve capacity shall be made for facilities outside the sewer service
area existing on the date of adoption of this Ordinance unless the Board finds that the extension
of the Sewers and the proposed development is in the best interest of the Town.
(d) Subsequent to application of the allocation priority, uncommitted reserve capacity in
the sewage treatment plant may be allocated to specific projects according to the procedures
established by the Board.
(e) Building sewer connection permit applications shall be filed in the Town Clerk's office
and marked with the time and date by the person receiving the application. Thereafter the Board
shall review the applications on a first come, first serve basis. The total remaining uncommitted
wastewater reserve capacity shall be allocated by the Board in such a way that there are no
limitations on what total reserve amounts can be allocated in any one year as long as
uncommitted capacity exists, and no limitation of the type of development receiving the
allocation. The total reserve capacity will be determined each six (6) months and committed
reserve will be continuously recorded for use in allocation decisions.
(f) The Board retains the right to review applications and make allocations on other than a
first-come-first-serve basis if they find such action is in the Town's best interest.
Sec. 13-34. Cost Recovery for Town Sewer Expansion
125
Any expansion of the Town sewer service area to provide for new users shall be funded by the
proposed users paying the portion of the cost of the expansion and upgrade of the Town Sewers
determined appropriate by the Board. In determining this portion, the Board may consider the
percentage of existing development out of the total of existing and proposed development to be
served. In determining this portion of cost the Board may also consider whether or not the
existing developments to be served have helped finance the existing wastewater system. The
Board shall assure that the portion paid by existing users can be financed within a three year
period without causing a rate increase of more than 5% within the three year period.
Sec. 13-35. Application Requirement
Persons wishing to use the Town's wastewater system shall apply to the Board on a form
prescribed by the Board. Such application shall:
(a) Identify the development wastewater flow and strength to be generated by the
project/development;
(b) Include calculations for the volume, flow rate, strength and any other characteristics
determined appropriate by the Board;
(c) Unless waived by the Board all calculations required in subsections (a) and (b) above
for developments generating in excess of 1000 gpd of wastewater, strength in excess of 200 mg/l
of BOD per day shall be certified by a Vermont registered engineer.
(d) Be accompanied by plans and specifications for the construction of building sewers
and any municipal sewer expansions, including pump stations, required to service the
development prepared by a Vermont registered engineer. This requirement to submit plans and
specifications may be waived by the Superintendent until final connection approval.
Sec. 13-36. Preliminary Building Sewer Connection Approval Findings
Upon receipt of the connection application and supportive documents, the Board may make
preliminary approval of uncommitted reserve capacity upon making affirmative findings that:
(a) The proposed wastewater is of domestic, sanitary origin and that there is sufficient
uncommitted reserve capacity to accommodate the volume and strength of the proposed
connection; or
(b) The proposed wastewater is not of domestic sanitary origin but that sufficient evidence
has been presented by the applicant to demonstrate that the flow and strength of the wastewater
is compatible with the proper operation of the wastewater systems and that the proposed
wastewater will not alone or in combination with other wastes cause a violation of the discharge
126
permit, pass through the Plant without treatment, interfere or otherwise disrupt the proper quality
and disposal of Plant sludge or be injurious in any other manner to the wastewater system and
that there is sufficient uncommitted reserve capacity to accommodate the flow and strength of
the wastewater from the proposed development; and
(c) The proposed use of wastewater reserve capacity complies with the allocation
priorities and principles and is not in conflict with any other enactment adopted by the Board or
Town.
Sec. 13-37. Conditions of Preliminary Building Sewer Connection Approval
The Board, after making approval findings may issue a preliminary building sewer connection
approval, which approval shall be a binding commitment of capacity to the project contingent on
compliance with any conditions attached to the preliminary approval and the subsequent issuance
of a final connection approval. The preliminary approval conditions shall include:
(a) Specification of the period of time during which the interim connection approval shall
remain valid, and provisions for time extensions if approved by the Board.
(b) Incorporation of specific conditions which must be fulfilled by the applicant to
maintain validity of the preliminary connection approval.
(c) Provision for revocation by the action of the Board on failure of the applicant to fulfill
requirements of the preliminary building sewer connection approval.
(d) Specification that the recipient of the preliminary building sewer connection approval
may not transfer, by any means, the preliminary connection approval to any other person or
connect to the Sewers.
Sec. 13-38. Other Permits Required Prior to Final Connection Approval
Prior to final building sewer connection approval the applicant shall have:
(a) Secured all other applicable local, State and Federal permits required for the
development/project;
(b) Paid to the Town all connection fees, impact fees, permit fees and other local fees or
taxes. Impact fees will be partially based on the flowage and strength of the proposed
wastewater.
127
(c) Filed with the Board the plans and specifications for connection to and, if necessary,
expansion of the municipal sewers.
Sec. 13-39. Final Building Sewer Connection Approval Requirements
(a) The Board upon making affirmative findings that all conditions of the preliminary
building sewer connection approval and final building sewer connection requirement in
sections 13-27 and 13-28 have been fulfilled or satisfied shall issue the final connection
approval permit which approval may be conditioned as follows:
(1) The permit shall specify the allowed wastewater flowage and strength and any
other characteristics determined appropriate by the Board.
(2) The capacity allocation is not transferable to any other person or project unless
approved in writing by the Board.
(3) The construction of the building sewer connection and, if necessary, the
municipal Sewer expansion, must be overseen and certified to be in compliance
with the plans and specifications and good construction practice by a licensed
plumber, Vermont Registered Professional engineer or employee of the Town
authorized by the Board.
(4) Capacity allocated in conjunction with the final building sewer connection
permit shall revert to the Town if the permit recipient has failed to initiate
construction within two years from the date the permit is issued.
(b) Regardless of the permit expiration period above, the Board may permit construction
of the development over a longer period if this action is in the Town's best interest.
(c) In cases where a final connection permit expires and a new person applies for capacity
on the same or different project, the Board may consider previous fees paid by the original
person when setting fees for the new person applying for capacity.
(d) The Superintendent shall be notified one week in advance of any proposed sewer
connection authorized by a final connection permit. The connection to the municipal
sewer shall not be performed unless a municipal official is present and shall not be
covered until approved by the official.
Sec. 13-40. Transfer of Allocation
128
(a) Initially, reserve capacity is allocated by the Board to a specific person, project and
parcel of land. The allocation is not made solely to a parcel of land and therefore does not
run with the land during project construction. After completion of the project or permit
expiration, however, the allocation (adjusted to the actual development constructed, if
necessary) will run with the land.
(b) The transfer of a capacity allocation is prohibited unless approved in writing by the
Board at the original owner's request.
(c) The Board may approve a transfer of capacity from one project to another and one
owner to another provided the new project and owner meet all the requirements for the
final connection permit originally issued and the original owner requests such transfer.
Sec. 13-41. Authority to Require Connection
Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting or impairing the authority of the Town or the Board
to require connections to the Plant and Sewers under the laws of the State of Vermont or local
ordinances.

commercial and industrial not less than six (6) inches. The building sewer shall be laid on a
uniform grade, wherever practicable, at a straight grade of at least one-fourth (1/4) of an inch per
foot (2%). Where, in special cases, a minimum grade of one-fourth (1/4) inch per foot cannot be
maintained, a grade of one-eighth (1/8) inch per foot (1%) may be permitted, but only after the
Superintendent has given written approval for the specific connection. Application for a
variance shall be made prior to construction.
Sec. 13-61. Location of Building Sewers
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the
131
basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three (3) feet (91.4 cm) of
any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford
protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade in the direction from the
main sewer to the building and in a straight alignment insofar as possible. Change in direction
shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings with suitable clean-outs or flush holes
as described in Sec. 13-69 of this Division.
Sec. 13-62. Below Grade Sewers
In all buildings in which the plumbing is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
wastewater to be carried by such sewer shall be lifted by approved artificial means and
discharged to the building sewer.
Sec. 13-63. Storm Water Collection
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway
drains, cellar drains, basement sumps, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a
building sewer which, in turn, is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. All
such connections which exist shall be disconnected by the Owner, at his or her expense, within
thirty (30) days of receipt of notification by the Board.
Sec. 13-64. Building Sewer Construction Practices
When installing the building sewer, the trenches shall be dug in a careful manner and properly

inconvenience to the public. Proper barricades and lights must be maintained around the trench
to guard against accidents.
Sec. 13-65. Backfilling
In backfilling, the material under, around and for two (2) feet (61 cm) immediately over the pipe
shall be selected in accordance with pipe manufacturers allocation procedures. The backfill
must be carefully tamped and the balance of the trench backfilled in a workmanlike manner,
tamping and filling in eight (8) inch (20.3 cm) layers so as to reduce any settlement. When the
trench has been filled to the proper height, the road material is to be replaced and heavily tamped
or rolled.
132
Sec. 13-66. Excavations
Where the trench is excavated in rock, the rock must be carefully excavated to a depth of six (6)
inches (15.2 cm) below the bottom of the sewer and the trench brought to the proper elevation
with gravel or other material satisfactory to the Superintendent. The remainder of the trench
must be backfilled with suitable material as described in Sec. 13-65 of this Division.
Sec. 13-67. Subsoil Conditions
Where subsurface-soil conditions warrant, special precautions must be taken as may be directed
by the Superintendent.

The connection of the building sewer to the main sewer shall be made at the house connection at
the property line or, if no house connection exists, connection shall be made at the nearest
available "Y" connection on the main sewer or at a manhole. The Superintendent will designate
the position of the end of the house connection at the property line or the "Y" connection on the
main sewer, whichever is appropriate. If it becomes necessary to cut into the main sewer, when
no other source of connection is available, then such connection shall be made as directed by and
under the supervision of the Superintendent. The dead-ends of all pipes not immediately
connected with the house plumbing system must be securely closed by a water-tight cover of
impermeable material and properly marked and located.
Sec. 13-69. Building Sewer Clean-outs
The use of clean-outs on the building sewer shall be made by installing a "Y" and one-eighth
(1/8) bends. The clean-outs shall ordinarily be installed at the point of connection between the
building sewer and the outside part of the house plumbing system at all curves on the building
sewer and on the straight part of the house sewer to the main sewer. The clean-out shall be
brought up from the building sewer to four (4) inches (10.2 cm) below ground level and properly
capped. Locations of all clean-outs shall be recorded and turned over to the Superintendent.
Clean-outs shall be of the same diameter as the building sewer and shall be located where
directed by the Superintendent.
Sec. 13-70. Compliance with Ordinance

plumber and contractor, at their own expense, shall furnish all necessary tools, labor, materials
and assistance for such tests and shall remove or repair any defective materials when so ordered
by the Board.
Sec. 13-73. Required Insurance and Bond
Any person performing work on public property for the purpose of installing a building sewer
shall file with the Superintendent evidence of adequate insurance coverage for liability and
property damage and provide a cash Bond for the value of materials and installation. Minimum
amounts of insurance coverage and cash Bond will be established by the Board and posted in the
Town Clerk's Office.
Sec. 13-74. Guarding of Worksite
All work shall be adequately guarded with barricades, lights and other measures for protection to
the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, curbs and other public property disturbed in the
course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent and other
Town authorities having jurisdiction.
Sec. 13-75. Vehicular and Pedestrian Access
The Contractor shall not block any driveway, street or road at any time without permission of the
Superintendent and other controlling agencies. Every effort shall be made to permit the
movement of vehicular traffic at all times. Whenever it becomes necessary to cross or interfere
with roads, walks or drives, whether public or private, the Contractor shall maintain, at his or her
own expense and subject to the approval of the Superintendent, safe bridges or other means of
egress.
134
Sec. 13-76. Maintenance
Maintenance of all private wastewater facilities including, but not limited to, (1) house plumbing
systems, (2) building sewers to the main sewer, (3) house connections, (4) sewers and (5)
appurtenances shall be the responsibility of the Owner, at his or her expense. The Owner shall be
solely responsible for continually maintaining such facilities in satisfactory operating condition.
Maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, (1) maintaining flow, (2) clearing obstructions,
(3) maintaining all joints gas and water-tight, (4) repair or replace collapsed, deteriorated or
defective materials, and (5) all other work which is necessary and essential to maintaining proper
operation and preserving the structural integrity and water-tightness of the system.
Sec. 13-77. Limitations on Permits
The Owner is committed by sewer connection and any other permits to construct the
project/building/development to meet all specifications for which capacity was issued. The
Superintendent or other person authorized by the Town will inspect existing buildings and
construction sites from time to time during each construction phase to assure permit
specifications are being met. A final inspection shall be made prior to the connection from the
building to the main sewer line by the Superintendent. Any permit specification violation not
corrected within a reasonable time set by the Board will render the sewer permit void. The
Owner may apply for a new sewer permit; however, there is no guarantee capacity will exist for
a new sewer permit to be issued. The sewer permit is a unilateral agreement between the Town
and the Owner of the project/building. The Owner to whom the sewer permit is issued does not
own the capacity and forfeits all rights to capacity if preliminary and final permit requirements
are not met. The capacity allocation belongs to the Town and is not transferable until the
project/building/development is constructed and sewer connected to the main sewer line.

service created by expansion into new areas will be evaluated considering the total impact on the
entire system. Where an impact causes any potential reduction in the standards of service to
151
existing users, new users requesting connections will be required to complete such system
improvements to eliminate any such impacts as a condition for obtaining a water connection
permit.

DIVISION 4. APPLICATION PROCEDURE
Sec. 13-221. General
Applications will be presented to the Superintendent in a form that provides full information
necessary for adequate review of the proposed project.
Sec. 13-222. Preliminary Application
(a) Capacity Commitment: Because the water system is limited by the capacity for
service, the first step in obtaining an approval for a proposed project is to receive a
capacity commitment from the Board. If there is no capacity commitment, an application
for full approval will not be accepted until such time as the project is either reduced to
meet capacity reserves or more capacity is constructed within the system.
A preliminary application must include information necessary for the Board to make a judgment
on the capacity of the existing system to provide the capacity requirement of that project.
Included will be location of the project, projected water demands, proposed sizes of lines and a
general utility layout. A connection fee will accompany all preliminary applications. (See
schedule of charges.) Though detailed plans are not required at this stage, information must be
complete enough to enable the Board to make a decision. If capacity commitment is given, a
detailed submission of plans will be required before approval for construction.
153
(b) Water System Application/Capital Facilities Charges:
(1) Properties Subject to Water System Application/ Capital Facilities Charges
and Effective Dates:
(A) All structures not occupied before July 1, 1992 shall be subject to
Water System Application/Capital Facilities Charges except as
provided under Section 2. The date of occupancy for new structures
shall be the date of issuance of Certificate of Occupancy.
(B) All structures that have experienced a change of use after July 1, 1992
that require additional water and/or sewer services shall be subject to
Water System Application/ Capital Facilities Charges except as
provided under Section 2. New connection and/or capacity charges
will apply solely to the additional demand.
(2) Transition Rule: To provide a fair transition from the existing to new charges,
the following are exceptions to subject properties under Section 1:
(A) No structures that have received approval for connection or additional
demand as of July 1, 1992 will be subject to Water System
Application/Capital Facilities Charges if they are connected and receive
a Certificate of Occupancy on or before January 1, 1993.
(B) No occupied structures which have or receive a Certificate of
Occupancy on or before July 1, 1992 will be subject to Water System
Application/Capital Facilities Charges if they are connected by January
1, 1993.
(3) Water System Application/Capital Facilities Charges:
Applicants intending to connect to the Town's water system shall pay an initial Water System
Application/Capital Facilities Charge in addition to all other fees and charges which are in effect.
The Water System Application/Capital Facilities Charge shall be established by the Board and
posted in the Town Clerk's Office. Gallonage computation shall be based on flow quantities
utilized by the State of Vermont, Department of Environmental Conservation.
(4) Payment Policy: The Water System Application/Capital Facilities Charges
shall be paid as follows:
(A) 10% upon application for gallonage requested to be reserved, on forms
provided by the Town. This fee is non-refundable.
(B) On or before two (2) months from the date of said application, the
154
applicant shall enter into a contract with the Town to reserve and
purchase water capacity.
(C) If any State or local permits are required on a project for which a Water
System Application/Capital Facilities Charge has been assessed, an
additional 40% of the fee shall be paid within eighteen (18) months
from the date of the contract in Sec. 4B, or the date of receipt of the last
required permit, whichever first occurs. If such permit or permits are
denied, or, if the applicant abandons a project before the start of
construction because of permit denial, or for any other reasons, the
contract, if entered into, will be deemed null and void. Any payment
made, excepting the 10% paid upon application (as per sec. 4A), shall
be returned without interest, and reservation of gallonage shall be
withdrawn. For the purpose of this Policy, the applicant shall be
deemed to have abandoned a project if he fails to enter into a contract
within two (2) months of the application and payment in Sec. 4A, or
when he fails to commence construction within eighteen (18) months
from the date of the contract, or make the payment required in Sec. 4D.
(D) The remaining 50% for each unit is due prior to receiving a zoning
permit for construction for that unit.
(E) Projects may be phased only by written agreement between the Town
and the applicant, or when required by the Town because of low or
insufficient plant or System capacity. If a contract is made for one
phase, allocation of gallonage therein provided shall be only for that
phase, and the Town shall not thereby, be deemed to have bound or
committed itself, impliedly or otherwise, to enter into contracts for
additional phases, or to provide gallonage therefor, nor shall the
consumer be deemed bound or committed to construct future phases.
Such contract shall be binding only for the project therein described as
if no other phases were intended, and the Water System
Application/Capital Facilities Charges shall be computed only for such
phases. If a contract describes more than one phase of a total project,
then the Water System Application/Capital Facilities Charges shall be
computed on the entire project as described, and shall be payable as
provided here, except that the 50% payment in Sec. 4D shall be paid in
proportion to such phases, and prior to receiving zoning permits for
construction of each phase, but no later than the termination date stated
in the contract.
(F) Applicants who desire to construct residential buildings not located in,
or part of planned developments or for which no contract and/or permit
is necessary or required, shall pay 10% of the Water System
155
Application/Capital Facilities Charge upon application (as per Sec. 4A)
and shall pay the remaining 90% prior to receiving a zoning permit for
construction or within 18 months of application.
Sec. 13-223. Full Application
(a) General. A full application will be prepared by the applicant in compliance with the
Standard Specifications of the Town on forms provided by the Town. All plans are to be
prepared in accordance with these design standards. Two sets of design plans and
specifications will be submitted to the Board by the Applicant. The Board will review all
plans and specifications for conformance with its standards. This review will be made
where applicable by the Town's duly appointed engineer. The Board may take the
following actions:
(1) Approval for construction.
(2) Conditional approval for construction.
(3) Request for additional information or review comments.
(4) Rejection of Request.
(b) Acceptance of Application. Acceptance of the application by the Superintendent
obligates the applicant to pay the Town its established rates and charges and to comply
with the rules and regulations. If the rendering of service requires a new service
connection or other work on the premise, the occupant must present to the Board a permit
in writing from the owner authorizing the utility to enter the premises to do the necessary
work.
(c) Size and Location of Service. The Town reserves the right to assign size and location
for the water service.
(d) Requirement for Existing Main. Applications will be accepted subject to there being
an existing main in a street or right-of-way abutting on the premises to be served, but
acceptance shall in no way obligate the Town to extend its mains to serve the premises,
excepting as hereinafter provided.
Secs. 13-224--13-226. Reserved
156
DIVISION 5. REGULATIONS - OPERATIONS
Sec. 13-227. Procedure for Initiation and Expansion of Water Service
The Board will consider acceptance of a utility project for initiation of water service only after
completion of and providing the following has been received and is found to be satisfactory by
the Board:
Certification of the Resident Inspector and Project Engineer of conformance with the Standard
Specifications, Rules and Regulations, and approved plans and specifications.
Copies of all deeds and right of way instruments for all new water mains.
Copies of "as built" plans on 24" x 36" reproducible Mylar showing ties to all fittings, valves,
corporations, curb stops and boxes, and stubs.
Release of all liens from all subcontractors and suppliers.
Certification of the required leakage test, pressure test and chlorination procedures and results of
successful bacteriological sampling. Water only shall be supplied by the Town for these
activities.
Payment of all applicable fees.
Sec. 13-228. Conformance with Other Regulations
The proposed project will be required to obtain other applicable permits. The securing of final
approval of the project does not remove the responsibility of obtaining other permits, such as
public building permits, zoning and planning permits, Act 250, Town highway or sewer
connection permits. The applicant is advised to seek advice in compliance with all permits.
Sec. 13-229. Compliance Standards
All applications will comply with the following:
Rules, Regulations and Specifications of the Town.
American Water Works Association Standards - latest revision.
157
Ten State Standards - 1987 or latest revision.
Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, Public Water System Regulations.
Vermont Standards for Water System Design and Construction.
National Plumbing Code 1968 or latest revision.
Sec. 13-230. Internal Improvements
Whenever a proposed water main expansion, improvement or addition to the utility causes any
other portion of the system to be inadequate or places such impact on that existing portion of the
system that it renders that portion of marginal serviceability, it shall be required that the
proposed project include such improvements required for the existing system to eliminate such
impacts.
The internal improvements shall be made in conformance with the overall master plans of the
Water System and the Municipal Development Plan. The improvements will be determined by
the Board in conformance with the master plan and after analysis of the total hydraulic effect on
the system.
Sec. 13-231. St. Johnsbury Water District Service Areas
The Board has adopted a defined a Water Service Area and it is depicted on the map entitled
"Water Service Areas" and recorded with the Town Clerk and attached hereto as part of
Ordinance. (854'MSL grade line)
It is the purpose of the service area to confine the distribution system to elevations that can be
effectively served by the existing supply system; this service area will encompass the area where
the municipal water system can provide a minimum pressure of 35 PSI at the municipal main. It
is further the purpose of the Service Area to eliminate extensive expansion of the utility until
such time as development within the Service Area has been undertaken. Current capacity of the
utility recognizes that the existing service areas can utilize all of the current capacity when fully
developed. It is the policy of the Board to phase needed improvements to the system to coincide
with capital improvement revenues.
Upon application to the Board approvals for expansion may be granted providing the Board
158
determines the following:
The expansion does not negatively affect any existing users, or
The existing system can be modified to allow the expansion without negative effect to existing
users, or
Adequate source, supply, storage, or distribution exists or can be reasonably modified to
accommodate the expansion without negative effects on the existing users.
Sec. 13-232. Meters
All water service by the Town shall be sold on the basis of meter measurements, or as otherwise
provided for in its rate schedules and the Town may install meters whenever deemed expedient.
The customer may receive water through a meter only upon written application to the Town. The
size, manufacturer and model of the meter will, in all cases, be determined by the Town.
All meters shall be set, as nearly as possible, at the point of entrance of the service pipe to the
building, and the customer shall provide and maintain a clean, dry, warm and accessible place to
service the meter. Meters, once set, may be moved in location at the request of the customer at
his or her expense, and the work may be done only by an agent of the Town or by a Vermont
Licensed Plumber registered and approved by the Town. A meter must be installed before water
service is initiated.
For new installation of meters two (2) inches and larger in nominal size, the piping arrangement
shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Town.
Remote reading registers acceptable to the Town shall be utilized. If provided by the Town as a
retrofit primarily to expedite its meter reading and billing procedures, the installation shall be at
the Town's expense.
When the customer fails or neglects to furnish a suitable location for a meter inside his building,
or when for other reasons it is necessary or expedient to locate the meter outside the building, an
underground vault acceptable to the Town shall be provided and maintained at the expense of the
customer.
Use of service pipe material which is deemed by the Town to be inferior shall constitute grounds
for requiring the use of a meter installation at an exterior location.
Meter repairs and replacements necessitated by ordinary wear will be paid for by the Town.
Those caused by freezing, hot water, or by other causes within the control of the customer will
159
be charged to the customer, including the cost of removing and replacing the damaged meter.
Meters will be carefully tested before installation. Thereafter, meters will be tested free of charge
at the request of the customer provided such request is not made more frequently than once in
twelve (12) months.
If tests are requested more than once every twelve months, the Town may require the customer
to make a deposit which will cover the reasonable cost of the test. If the meter is found to overregister
by more than two (2) percent, the deposit will be refunded together with the percentage
of error computed for the duration of the last billing period. If the meter is found to underregister
by more than two (2) percent, the customer will be charged such percentage of error
computed for the duration of the last billing period. If the meter registers with two (2) percent,
plus or minus, it will be deemed correct, and the deposit will be retained by the Town. The
customer may be present when the Town conducts the test on his or her meter, or if he or she
desires, send an expert or other representative appointed by him or her. A written report giving
the result of such test shall be made to the customer.
Metering shall be required for all connections. Meters are to be obtained and installed by the
owner in conformance with the Town standards. Once installed and approved by the Town, the
meter will be solely the responsibility of the Town and all maintenance and replacement will
thereafter be borne by the Town.
Every service must be provided with an operable stop and waste valve inside the building near
the service entrance, easily accessible, and protected from freezing. All piping shall be so
arranged as to prevent back-siphonage and to permit draining whenever necessary. Backflow
devices will be required.
Sec. 13-233. Installation of Services
The cost of service taps, installing and maintaining the pipe from the main line to the property
shall be borne by the Applicant. This pipe may be installed by a private contractor approved by
the Town. The installation must comply with Town's specifications and may not be covered until
it is inspected and approved by the Superintendent. No new installations may be made, nor
further connections made to existing installations unless approved by the Board. The Applicant
shall be responsible for securing appropriate Public Liability and All Risk "Builders Risk"
insurance and indemnify and holding harmless the Town and its agents from damages involving
or related to the connection and water line installation work.
Existing connections to the system shall remain connected, unless express permission is granted
by the Town for disconnection.
The Town shall not be responsible for damage due to escaping water or arising from the use of
water or from any damage arising from leaks in piping or equipment.
160
All new construction shall use low-flow type water fixtures as approved by the Town.
Sec. 13-234. Temporary Service
Contractors, builders and property owners desiring temporary water service for construction
purposes shall make application in writing to the Town and secure approval for this service.
Temporary water services will be supplied providing it does not interfere with use of water for
general purposes. The cost of temporary service and the cost of its removal shall be borne by the
applicant. The estimated cost of temporary service shall be payable in advance by a deposit with
Town Treasurer. Upon completion of the use of temporary service an accounting shall be made.
If the amount of deposit does not cover the actual cost, the applicant will be billed the additional
amount. If the deposit exceeds the actual cost, the applicant shall be refunded the difference.
These charges are in addition to the charge for use of water which will be billed at the published
rate.
Sec. 13-235. Winter Provisions
The Town shall not be required to install any service lines or service connections during winter
conditions, except by special arrangement, in which case the customer shall pay for the excess
over normal costs. In those cases where customer owned service pipe or main is frozen, the
thawing shall be done by the Owner at the expense of the Owner. If it is determined that the
freezing is between the main and the curb stop, it shall be the responsibility of the Town to
restore service. To avoid a recurrence, the Town may order an examination of the customer's
service pipe or main and if the same is not at a depth of five and one-half (5 1/2) feet, as
required, the Town reserves the right to require it to be so relocated before service is resumed.
Sec. 13-236. Abatement
If premises are to be vacated for a period of thirty (30) days or more, abatement of water charges
may be had by notifying the Town in writing in advance of the date such vacancy is to occur.
The Town will then discontinue service at the shutoff or in case two or more occupancies are
supplied by a single service, seals will be placed upon the stop and waste valve or fixtures of the
vacant premises. A charge will be made for each resumption of service, and a charge will be
made for each seal required. Abatement will not be available for partial vacancy of multiple
units served through a single meter.
Sec. 13-237. Sprinkler Systems
161
Application: Application for new sprinkler systems must be made by the owner of the property
or his or her authorized agent and will be subject to all provisions and specifications of the
Town. The Fire Department is hereby made a party to this review.
Plans and Specifications: The applicant must furnish complete set of drawings showing the
location of the premises, sprinkler heads and other appurtenances. These plans will remain as
property of the Town. The applicant further agrees to furnish the Town with drawings showing
revisions to piping or appurtenances whenever any revisions are made.
Criteria: No private fire connection will be made on a water main of less than six (6) inches in
diameter. The Town expressly reserves the right to determine the necessity for the advisability of
granting any application for special service, depending on the size of street main, availability of
pressure, and the nature and capacity of the fire protection equipment to be installed.
Charges and Costs: Installation of the fire protection service shall be by, or under the direction
of, the Town. All charges therefore are payable by the customer.
Inspection: All fire services shall be subject to periodic inspections by the Town. The owners of
such systems will give the Town inspectors all reasonable facilities for making the inspection
and any information concerning such system that they may require. Inspections will be made
with as little inconvenience to the owner as possible.
Illegal Use: Sprinkler system connections shall be used for fire protection only. Using such
connections for other than fire protection purposes shall constitute unauthorized use and a
violation of the Ordinance.
Additional Requirements: Backflow devices and FM rated meters are required.
Sec. 13-238. Fire Hydrants
General: Hydrants are the property of the Town. All public fire hydrants and their connections
are installed and maintained by the Town.
Obstruction Prohibited: No person or persons shall obstruct the access to any fire hydrant by
replacing or permitting snow, debris or building material or other obstruction to remain on or
about the hydrant which will in any manner interfere with its immediate use.
Use: Public fire hydrants are for the sole purpose of fire protection and, with the exception of the
Water Department, and the Fire Department operating the same for the legitimate purpose of
extinguishing fires or conducting a bona fide drill or practice, no other use shall be made without
consent of the Water Department.
162
Sec. 13-239. Interruption of Service
Disclaimers of Liability: The Town furnishes water, not pressure and does not guarantee a
continuous supply. No responsibility is assumed for any damage to any apparatus in any house or
building due to shutting off water or providing excess pressure without notice either for:
(1) Repairs; or
(2) Pipeline breaks; or
(3) Necessary operations; or
(4) Malfunction of system facilities
No Refunds: No persons shall be entitled to have any portion of a payment refunded for any
stoppage occasioned by accident to any portions of the water works, nor for stoppage for
purposes of additions or repairs, nor for non-use occasioned by absence or any other reason.
Unless the interruption is in effect for a continuous period in excess of ten (10) days, in which
case a proportional refund will be made.
Notice of Interruption: Notice of interruption of service is not required. While it is the intention
to give notice, as far as possible, in advance of any work which must be done that will
necessitate interruption of the supply, such notice is to be considered a courtesy only, and not a
requirement on the part of the Town. In case of a break in a pipeline, water may be shut off
without notice. Any announcement will be by general announcement in the local newspaper.
Failure of tenant or property owner to receive notice of interruption of service shall entail no
liability on the part of the Town, or its employees. Property owners should install range boilers,
hot water tanks and all other equipment connected with the water supply system in such a
manner that damage will not occur if the water is shut off without notice.
Maintenance of Pressure: The Town will attempt to maintain adequate system pressures and will
not be required to render service where normal system pressures may be expected to fall below
thirty-five (35) pounds per square inch. Where the superintendent determines that the system
pressures within the range provided are higher than the customer's plumbing or apparatus can
endure, it shall be the responsibility of the customer to install a suitable pressure reducing device.
Pressure reducing devices are "recommended" when the service pressure exceeds 45 psi.
Pressure reduction devices are "required" when service pressure exceeds 60 psi.
Sec. 13-240. Unauthorized Use of Water - Water Conservation Policy
General: No person shall in any way or by any device obtain the use of water without
authorization, including the operation of any valves by repairmen and plumbers or others for any
purpose.
Resale of Water: No customer shall be allowed to furnish for a fee or a charge to other persons or
163
property, water.
Waste: Water shall not be allowed to run to waste through any faucets or fixtures to prevent
freezing or kept running for any longer than necessary for its proper use. The Town is required to
restrain and prevent any and all waste of water and to that end may, when necessary, turn off the
water or take such other action as, in its judgment, appears proper. The Board of Water
Commissioners shall have the authority to limit the use of water from time to time when
conditions so warrant.
Drought/Emergencies: The Town reserves the right, in periods of drought or emergency or when
deemed essential for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, to restrict, curtail, or
prohibit the use of water for secondary purposes, such as sprinkling, car washing, or filling
swimming pools, and shall have the right to fix the hours and periods when water may be used
for such purposes.
Right to Make Inspections: Inspectors or persons so authorized by the Town shall have free
access at all reasonable hours to all parts of every building for the purpose of inspection,
removing or replacing meters, examining fixtures, and observing the manner in which water is
used.
Request to Turn on Water: After service has been shut off because of customer's failure to abide
by any of these regulations, it shall not be turned on until a written request for service has been
submitted to and approved by the Town.
Sec. 13-241. Developments
Application for Service: Any developer, contractor or builder or any person or group of persons
who wish to supply a subdivision or development either within or outside the existing water
service area shall make a written application to the Board as detailed under Article IV, Section
1.0 "Application Procedure".
Applicable Standards: All development, subdivision or multi-building piping shall be built to the
specifications and amendments published by the Town, and any state or federal agencies having
jurisdiction over same. The Town's Engineer may review such designs as directed by the Town.
Areas Served: Service boundaries shall be defined by the Town and the furnishing of water shall
be at the discretion of the Board and as further defined in the special district provisions herein.
Approval: Developments and subdivisions to and within which water distribution mains, service
piping and hydrants are constructed to specifications of the Town and agencies mentioned in the
above paragraph shall, upon the approval of the Board, be accepted as part of the Town's system
from date of acceptance and thereafter. All provisions of Section 13-227 must be met.
Costs/Expenses: The cost of extensions shall be borne by the customer to such extent as shall be
164
determined by the Board, and no system contract work shall be executed by the customer prior to
the approval of the extension or further installation.
Limitation on Development: The Town shall at no time jeopardize its current customers by
authorizing more new water services than it can supply.
Fire Protection: Fire protection shall be provided for all developments including any waterline
extensions longer than 500 feet from existing hydrants owned by the Town. Flow requirements
shall be in accordance with the master plan for the Town and with the Insurance Services
Organization (ISO) criteria. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed system extension
or further installation does not jeopardize capacity for fire flow for existing or approved
customers within the system service area.
Sec. 13-242--13-245. Reserved
DIVISION 6. WATER RENTS
Sec. 13-246. Fixed, Operation and Maintenance Charge
A water rent charge, which shall be determined by the Board, is hereby imposed upon every
person having a building or structure on their premises and that is served by the water works
directly or indirectly for the use of the premises by the Owners, or other users of real property
within the Town. The user charge shall be for the purpose of the payment of the costs associated
with operating, maintaining and repairing said system. The Board may establish a separate fixed
annual charge for bond payments, and for fixed operating and maintenance costs not dependent
on actual or estimated use. The charges determined by the Board shall be filed with the Town
Clerk. The fixed annual charge established by this Section shall be charged whether or not the
property is fully or partially occupied, when the property is connected to the water works as
required under the terms of this Ordinance.
Sec. 13-247. Calculation of Water Rent Charge
The water rent charge stipulated in Sec. 13-247 of this Division shall be based upon a water
meter measurement. The Board will determine the actual charge from measurements of each
metered user. The fixed annual charge is for bond repayment and fixed operations and
maintenance costs. No user will be billed less than the average single family charge for the fixed
165
charges, plus actual flow related charges. The annual charges stipulated in Sec. 13-247 of this
Division are based upon rate structure(s) established by the Board as provided for in 24 V.S.A.,
Chapter 89.
Sec. 13-248. Capital Costs
The design, construction and development costs of all public water system expansions and
extensions which have been approved by the Board shall be borne by the developers and
property owners requiring, requesting or directly benefiting from such extensions and/or
expansions, unless the voters of the Town shall vote at a duly warned annual or special meeting
to assume all or a portion of the costs involved. When the voters of the Town vote to assume all
or a portion of the costs, such costs will be paid from the collection of taxes unless the voters of
the Town approve some other means of raising the required monies.
Sec. 13-249. Collection
Collection of delinquent water rents may be enforced by the Town pursuant to 24 V.S.A.,
Chapter 129; 24 V.S.A., § 3306; and 24 V.S.A., § 3311. In the event any water rent is not paid
within 30 calendar days from the billing date, a late penalty charge will be added to the water
rent together with interest charges. The amount of the late penalty charge and the interest rate on
the overdue accounts shall be the same as those applied to the collection of taxes. If such
payment is not made, such water rent shall be a lien upon such real estate and shall be collected
according to all procedures allowed for in the collection of delinquent real estate taxes.
Sec. 13-250. Deposits
When a customer's credit is, or becomes impaired, the Department may, when it deems necessary
to guarantee payment of current bills, require a deposit. Such required deposit shall not exceed
the amount of an estimated billing period provided, however, such deposit to be refunded when
the customer has established credit.
Upon termination of service, the Department shall have the right to apply any deposit in payment
of any billing in arrears if such billing shall be unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days beyond the
due date. Retention of the deposit by the Department shall not constitute a waiver of its rights
otherwise to enforce collection of payment in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.
Sec. 13-251. Additional Charges
In addition, the costs associated with making the tap or connection at the main, including all
166
costs of materials and labor to install the line to the property line shall be paid by the Applicant
proposing to connect to the Public Water System.

attach such additional reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of the Act and these zoning by-laws.
204.4.5 A change in use, expansion or contraction of land, area, or alteration of structures or
uses which are designated as a conditional use within the district in which they are located and
are existing therein prior to the effective date of this by-law shall, subsequent to said effective
date, conform to all requirements herein pertaining to conditional uses.
204.4.6 In the case of any use designated as a "Conditional Use" because it does not meet the minimum
set back requirements set forth in the Table relating to a particular district a zoning permit may be issued
without a variance if the requirements of this Section are satisfied and if there exists a setback of not less
than five (5) feet; except that in the Mixed Use District designated as such on the Zoning Map entitled "St.
Johnsbury Zoning Map", the Development Review Board may eliminate the setback requirements entirely.
204.5 Duration of Conditional Use Approval. The necessary zoning permit for a conditional use may
be issued by the administrative officer, pursuant to Section 103 of this by-law any time within one (1) year

206.4 Any variance issued in the Special Flood Hazard Area will not increase flood heights, and
will inform the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that the issuance of
a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation increases risk to life and property
and will result in increased flood insurance premiums up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.37
206.5 Review Criteria. The DRB shall review a variance application in accordance with 24
V.S.A. § 4469.38
Note: 24 V.S.A. § 4469 provides that for any structure that is not primarily a renewable
energy resource structure the DRB shall grant variances and render a decision in favor of
the appellant, if all the following facts are found, and the finding is specified in its decision.
§ 4469. Appeal; variances
(a) On an appeal under § 4465 or § 4471 of this title in which a variance from the
provisions of a bylaw or interim bylaw is requested for a structure that is not
primarily a renewable energy resource structure, the board of adjustment or the
development review board or the environmental division created under 4 V.S.A.
chapter 27 shall grant variances and render a decision in favor of the appellant, if
all the following facts are found, and the finding is specified in its decision:
(1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and
that unnecessary hardship is due to these conditions, and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the bylaw in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(2) Because of these physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the bylaw, and that the authorization of a variance is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.

(3) Unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
(4) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property,
reduce access to renewable energy resources, or be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(5) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will
afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the bylaw and from
the plan.
(b) 24 V.S.A. § 4469 further provides that for any structure that is primarily a
renewable energy resource structure, the DRB shall grant variances and render a
decision in favor of the appellant, if all the following facts are found, and the finding
is specified in its decision:
(1) It is unusually difficult or unduly expensive for the appellant to build a
suitable renewable energy resource structure in conformance with the bylaws.
(2) The hardship was not created by the appellant.
(3) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property,
reduce access to renewable energy resources, or be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(4) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will
afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the bylaws and
from the plan.
(c) In rendering a decision in favor of an applicant under this Section, the DRB may
attach such conditions to variances as it may consider necessary and appropriate
under the circumstances to implement the purposes of this ordinance and the town
plan.

ARTICLE III Zoning Districts42
Section 301 Creation, Map and Interpretation
301.1 Zoning districts and a design control overlay are hereby created as depicted on the zoning
map entitled St. Johnsbury Zoning Map, which is incorporated herein by reference.
301.2 Interpretation and Application.43
a) The administrative officer shall interpret the location of district boundaries subject to
appeal to the DRB as provided in section 103.5 of this ordinance.
b) Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the official
zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
(i) Where district boundaries appear to approximately follow the center line of
highways, roads, alleys, railroads, streams, other bodies of water, civil
division lines, land lot lines, property lines or contour lines, such lines or
center lines shall be construed to be such boundaries as they existed at the
time of the first adoption of the subject boundary; and
(ii) Where district boundaries are indicated as being measured from or being
parallel to the center line of highways, roads, alleys, railroads, civil division
lines, land lot lines, or property lines, such boundaries shall be construed as
being measured from or being parallel thereto and at a distance therefrom
as indicated or as determined by the scale shown on the zoning map.
c) Where the common district boundary line between the R-L 1 district and the R-L 2
district intersects with the terminus of a town road, the provisions of the R-L 2 district
shall extend beyond the terminus of the town road into the R-L 1 district for a distance
which is equal to the width of the R-L 2 district on either side of said town road at the
point of intersection.44
d) Where a district boundary line divides a lot of record on the effective date of the
creation of such boundary line, the landowner may choose to have applied the standards
of either district up to thirty (30) feet into the other district.45
e) Notwithstanding what is shown on the St. Johnsbury Zoning Map, the design control
district hereby established by the select board and indicated on said map shall
encompass and include: all lots a) facing to any extent on Arnold Park, b) facing to
any extent Main Street along its entire length between Spruce Street to and including
the entire St. Johnsbury Academy property, c) facing, to any extent Fairbanks Drive
along its entire length, d) facing to any extent Eastern Avenue along its entire length

Richford Railroad); and e) facing to any extent, Railroad Street along its entire length
between Federal Street and Maple Street. In the event that any such lot is less than
seventy-five (75) feet in depth, any lot to the immediate rear thereof is also included in
the district hereby established.46
Section 302 Setbacks
302.1 Riverfront. No structure shall be placed and no land shall be excavated, filled, graded or
paved within the area designated by this section as riverfront setback from the natural bank of the
following rivers and streams: (i) the Passumpsic River; (ii) the Moose River, (iii) the Sleepers
River; and (iv) the Houghton Brook/Burrows Brook. The riverfront setback in each zoning district
shall be the same as the minimum front setback specified for that zoning district. The DRB may
waive some, or all of the riverfront setback requirement after public notice and hearing upon a
showing by the applicant that the proposed development adequately provides for (a) appropriate
landscaping and screening, (b) an adequate vegetative buffer between the development and the
river, (c) erosion control, and (d) control of storm water drainage and run-off.47
302.2 Front Setbacks on Narrow Streets. On streets or roads with less than a fifty (50) foot rightof-
way front setbacks shall be measured from the center line of the street or road, and twenty-five
(25) feet shall be added to the front yard setback requirement.
302.3 Rear and Side Setback Waiver. The DRB may approve, as a conditional use, a reduced
rear or side setback.
302.4 Corner Lots. For any lot abutting more than one (1) street for more than the minimum
front setback, front setbacks shall be measured from each such street and only the side
setback requirement shall apply to the remaining sides.
302.5 Lots which abut on more than one (1) street shall provide the required frontage along
every street.
302.6 For the purpose of determining setbacks, a lot with access from a private right-of-way
will be considered to front on the lot line where the right-of-way gives access to the lot.
302.7 Projections from structures may extend two feet into the required minimum setback of a
required yard space. Allowed projections are limited to eaves, chimneys, pilasters, cornices, sills.
302.8 Subject to the provisions of Section 302.7 of this by-law, all structures, whether attached
to the principal structure or not, and, whether open or enclosed, including porches, carports,
balconies, or platforms above normal grade level, shall not project into any minimum front,
side, or rear yard.
302.9 Fences shall be permitted within any required yard and minimum setback requirements
shall not be applicable to such fences subject to section 302.10.

developments as provided in Article VI of this ordinance. Uses that are not designated as either
permitted uses or conditional uses are prohibited.
50 2014 Adapted from 1973 Section 204.
28
Section 306 Rural Land One (RL-1) 51
306.1 Objective: Land classified as RL-1 should have the lowest intensity of use including
primarily such uses as agriculture and forestry with a maximum residential density of one (1)
family per ten (10) acres. Criteria considered in designating land within this district are the lack
of roads or road network within the area; the topography of the land; the availability of water and
sewer and, if such utilities are not available, the suitability or unsuitability of the land for sewage
drainage fields; and the remoteness of the land from population centers.

Section 307 Rural Land Two (RL-2)53
307.1 Objective: Land classified as RL-2 is land that is rural in character with forestry and
agricultural uses as its present primary use. The area is served by adequate town roads and
generally the soils and slopes are suitable for rural residential development. The maximum
residential density should be dependent on the source of domestic water supply and method of
sewage disposal. In addition, RL-2 residential development should not be allowed to expand so as
to be a hindrance to active farming operations.

316.3 Design Control District:
Compliance with the provisions of 24 V.S.A. §4414(E) having occurred in connection with:
a) The adoption of the 1972 St. Johnsbury Master Plan, which included a report
describing planning and design problems associated with the design Control District
therein proposed; and
b) The approval by the Planning Commission on January 23, 2003 of a Design District
report, and subsequent Planning Commission Report dated January 31, 2019
recommending an expansion of the original Design Control District, there is hereby
established an expanded Design Control District to the extent and as indicated on the
Zoning Map as the Design Control Districts Overlay. The designation of the Design
Control District hereby established by the Select board and indicated on said map is
intended to encompass and include all lots:
(i) facing to any extent on Arnold Park,
(ii) facing to any extent Main Street along its entire length between Spruce Street to
and including the entire St Johnsbury Academy property,
(iii) facing to any extent Fairbanks Drive along its entire length,
(iv) facing to any extent Eastern Avenue along is entire length between Main Street
and the right of way of Northern Vermont Railroad (Newport and Richford
Railroad);
(v) facing to any extent, Railroad Street along its entire length between Pearl
Street and a point approximately 300 feet north of Maple Street;
(vi) facing to any extent on Maple Street from Main Street to Railroad Street;
(vii) facing to any extent on Central Street from Main Street to Summer Street;
(viii) facing to any extent on Summer Street from Central Street to Webster Street,
including property on the east side of Summer approximately 100 feet south of Central
Street, and excluding properties on the east side of Summer Street a distance farther than
250 feet north of Winter Street;
(ix) facing to any extent on Winter Street from Summer Street to Main Street;

(xv) facing to any extent on Pearl Street from Federal Street to Maple Street to include 12
North Avenue and 186 Clarks Avenue.
In the event that any such lot is less than seventy five (75) feet in depth, any lot to the immediate
rear thereof is also included in the district hereby established. The indication of the boundary of
the Design Control District hereby established on said map is intended to be representational
only. When the administrative Officer cannot definitely determine the location of the boundary
of the district hereby established by reference to this Section 316.1.1, he or she shall refuse
action and the Development Review Board shall determine the boundary of such district with
reference to the purposes to be served by the creation of such district.88
316.4 Floodway and Flood Hazard Areas:89 Floodway and Flood Hazard Areas are areas
designated along rivers, streams, and shorelines that are subject to periodic flooding. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has assigned risk zones to more than 19,000
communities in the United States. This system of classification allows each community to
participate in the agency's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) with premium rates
determined based upon the zone classification.
The land area covered by the floodwaters of the base flood is the Special Flood Hazard Area
(SFHA) on NFIP maps. The SFHA is the area where the National Flood Insurance Program's
(NFIP's) floodplain management regulations must be enforced and the area where the mandatory
purchase of flood insurance applies. The SFHA includes Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR,
AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE, and V.
The Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) show areas within a 100-year flood boundary. A 100-
year flood area does not refer to a flood that occurs every 100 years but refers to a level of flooding
that has a 1 percent or greater probability of occurring or being exceeded in any given year. These
100-year flood areas are termed "Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs). SFHAs are further
divided into insurance risk rate zones. Areas between the 100-year and 500-year flood boundaries
are classified as moderate flood hazard areas. Minimal flood hazard areas represent those
remaining areas that lie above the 500-year flood level. Surprisingly, about one-third of all claims
paid by the NFIP are for areas identified as minimal or moderate risk for flooding, largely the
result of inadequate drainage systems.
A "Regulatory Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing
the water surface elevation more than a designated height. Communities must regulate
development in these floodways to ensure that there are no increases in upstream flood elevations.
For streams and other watercourses where FEMA has provided Base Flood Elevations (BFEs), but
no floodway has been designated, the community must review floodplain development on a case-
88 Boundary amended; May 28, 2019; no petitions were filed.
89 New 2014; FEMA definitions
44
by-case basis to ensure that increases in water surface elevations do not occur, or identify the need
to adopt a floodway if adequate information is available.
316.4.1 Summary Table: Development Review in Hazard Areas
The hazard areas are not appropriate sites for new structures nor for development that increases
the elevation of the base flood or obstructs the ability of streams to establish and maintain
geomorphic equilibrium.
316.4.2 Performance: In Zones AE, AH, and A1  A30 where base flood elevations and/or
floodway limits have not been determined, development shall not be permitted unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated encroachment, will not increase the base flood elevation more than
1.00 foot at any point within the community. The demonstration must be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles and certified by
a registered professional engineer.90

ARTICLE IV Special Issues
Part 1 Non-Conformities
Section 401 Existing Small Lots91
401.1 Any lot that is legally subdivided, is in individual and separate and nonaffiliated ownership
from surrounding properties, and is in existence on the date of enactment of any provision of this
ordinance first requiring a minimum lot size larger than such lot may be developed for the purpose
permitted in the district in which it is located, even though such lot no longer conforms to minimum
lot size requirements of this ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, development of such a lot
shall be prohibited if:
a) The lot is less than one-eighth (1/8) acre in area; or
b) The lot has a width or depth dimension of less than forty (40) feet.
401.2 If an existing small lot subsequently comes under common ownership with one (1) or more
contiguous lots, the nonconforming lot shall be deemed merged with the contiguous lot. However,
a nonconforming lot shall not be deemed merged and may be separately conveyed if all the
following apply:
a) The lots are conveyed in their preexisting, nonconforming configuration.
b) On the date of the enactment of any provision of this ordinance requiring a larger
lot size, each lot was developed with water supply and wastewater disposal system.
c) At the time of transfer, each water supply is not a failed water supply and each
wastewater system is not a failed wastewater system as such terms are defined by
10 V.S.A. § 1972.
Section 402 Nonconforming Uses and Structures92
a) Any use of land existing on or permitted as of the effective date of any provision
of this ordinance and not conforming thereto:
(i) Shall not be moved, enlarged, altered, extended, reconstructed or restored
nor shall any external evidence of such use be increased by any means
whatsoever, except to the extent provided in this ordinance.
(ii) Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without approval by the
DRB, after public notice and hearing, and then only to a use which, in the
determination of the DRB, is of the same or more in keeping with the
objective of the zoning district.
91 1973 Section 301.2.
92 1973 Article VI.
46
(iii) Shall not be re-established if such use has been discontinued for a period of
one (1) year or has been changed to, or replaced by, a conforming use.
Intent to resume a nonconforming use shall not confer the right to do so.
(iv) Shall not be restored to other than a conforming use after damage from any
cause, unless the nonconforming use is reinstated within one (1) year of
such damage. If the restoration of such building is not completed within
one (1) year, the nonconforming use of such building shall be deemed to
have been discontinued, unless such nonconforming use is carried on
without interruption in any undamaged part of the building. The DRB, after
public notice and hearing, may extend such one (1) year deadline for good
cause shown.
b) Any structure existing on or permitted as of the effective date of any provision of
this ordinance and not conforming thereto:
(i) Shall not be moved, enlarged, altered, extended, reconstructed, or restored
nor shall any external evidence of such use be increased by any means
whatsoever, except to the extent provided in this ordinance, except that nonconforming
buildings may be relocated without creating new setback or
height violations as long as applicable density and coverage standards are
either satisfied or the level of violation is not increased.
(ii) Shall not be restored so as to continue the non-conformance unless such
restoration is completed within one (1) year of such damage. The DRB,
after public notice and hearing, may extend such one (1) year deadline for
good case shown.
c) If a mobile home park, as defined in 10 V.S.A., Chapter 153, is a nonconformity
pursuant to this ordinance, the entire mobile home park shall be treated as a
nonconformity, and individual lots within the mobile home park shall in no event
be considered nonconformities.93
d) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent ordinary course maintenance and
repair of a nonconforming structure provided that such action does not increase the
degree of nonconformity.
e) After public notice and a hearing, the DRB may waive applicable restrictions and
allow the expansion of any nonconforming use or nonconforming structure if such
nonconformity combined with the proposed expansion does not adversely affect
the character of the surrounding area as it would exist without such nonconformity.
f) The administrative officer may issue for a period not exceeding one (1) year, a
zoning permit for nonconforming structures or uses incidental to construction
projects, conditioned upon removal of the structure or use upon completion of the
93 Adapted from 1973 Section 301.7(b).
47
project. Such permits may be renewed upon application for an additional period
not exceeding one (1) year.94
g) Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to restrict the authority of the town to
abate public nuisances or to abate or remove public health risks or hazards or to
enforce performance standards.95
Part 2 Performance Standards96
Section 408 Performance Standards
In accordance with 24 V.S.A. § 4414(5), in all districts the following performance standards,
together with all applicable State standards, shall be met. No use shall:
a) Emit noise in excess of seventy (70) decibels at any property line.
b) Emit any odor that is considered offensive.
c) Emit dust or dirt that is considered offensive.
d) Emit any smoke, in excess of Ringlemann Chart No. 2.
e) Emit any noxious gases that endanger the health, comfort, safety or welfare of any
person, or which have a tendency to cause injury or damage to property, business
or vegetation.
f) Cause, as a result of normal operations, a vibration which creates displacement of
0.002 of one (1) inch.
g) Create glare that could impair the vision of a driver of any motor vehicle.
h) Cause a fire, explosion or safety hazard.
Part 3 Design Standards

Where no requirement is designated and the use is not comparable to any of the listed uses, parking
requirements shall be as reasonably determined by the DRB based upon a consideration of the size
of the proposed facility and its associated uses.
When the calculation yields a fractional number of required spaces, the number of spaces shall be
rounded to the nearest whole number. Space used for fueling vehicles may not also be counted as
parking spaces. The DRB may reduce or increase the amount of required parking, after public
notice and a hearing for good cause shown. In reducing the amount of required parking, the DRB
may require an area up to the size necessary to provide the reduced amount of parking to be
maintained as green space on condition that it shall be converted to parking as necessary.
410.4 Parking Dimensional Requirements. Except to the extent waived by the DRB in
consideration of topography, location of existing or proposed structures, lot configuration, or the
reasonable desire to preserve existing trees and mature vegetation, the following parking lot design
and dimensional standards shall apply:

410.5 Except for one (1) and two (2) family dwellings, required parking may be located within
five hundred (500) feet from the use it serves on another parcel of land.
410.6 Parking for Disabled Persons. Parking spaces for disabled persons shall comply with the
current Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines and shall be at least eight feet (8) wide with
an adjacent access aisle at least five feet (5) wide. Parking access aisles shall be part of an
accessible route to the building or facility entrance. Accessible parking spaces shall be designated
as reserved for the disabled by a sign showing the symbol of accessibility. Painting of the paved
area for the dedicated parking spaces alone shall not be sufficient as the sole means of identifying
these spaces.
410.7 Front Yard Parking Restricted. Required parking in all residential zoning districts shall
not be located in a required front yard setback area abutting a public street, except alleys. This
prohibition extends from the edge of the public right-of-way into the required front yard setback
for the entire width of the property with the exception of a single access drive no more than twenty
feet (20) or less in width. Where parking is provided outside the required front yard setback, but
either partially or entirely between the principle structure and the street, such parking shall be
screened to the extent practicable from view from the public street.
410.8 Stacked or Tandem Parking Restrictions. Except as otherwise provided below, all parking
facilities shall be designed so that each motor vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space
provided for it without the moving of any other motor vehicle.
a) Stacked or valet parking may be allowed if an attendant is present to move vehicles. If
stacked parking is used for required parking spaces, a written commitment must be
filed with the town ensuring that an attendant will always be present when the lot is in
operation. The requirements for minimum spaces continue to apply for stacked
parking.
b) Tandem parking may be allowed for one (1) family detached dwelling units, accessory
apartments, duplex dwelling units, and dedicated employee-only parking signed as
such. In no case shall more than four (4) parking spaces (two (2) pairs) in total be
provided in tandem on any one lot.
410.9 Pedestrian Safety. Insofar as practical, pedestrian and bicycle circulation shall be separated
from motor vehicle circulation. Safe and convenient pedestrian circulation, including appropriate
51
sidewalks, shall be provided on the site and its approaches. The pedestrian circulation plan shall
be designed to minimize conflicts with vehicular traffic.
410.10 Provision for Alternative Modes of Transportation. For any project where land
development costs are expected to exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000), the DRB may require
the provision of a bus stop and parking for bicycles.
Section 411 Landscaping
411.1 Landscaping Plan. Except for non-commercial residential properties and in conformance
with any other ordinance, landscaping plans prepared by a landscape architect, master gardener,
nursery professional, arborist, professional landscape designer or other landscape professional,
including the following information, shall be submitted for site plan review:
a) All proposed physical improvements, such as buildings, walls, parking areas,
sidewalks, etc.
b) Proposed landscaping materials, including vegetation to remain, types of new plant
materials, identified by common name and botanical name, sizes of all new plant
materials by height and/or diameter at time of planting and at maturity, quantities of
each of the planting materials, and treatment of the ground surface (paving, seeding, or
groundcover).
c) The location of existing natural features, such as streams, wetlands, and rock
outcroppings.
411.2 Standards. Proposed landscaping shall comply with the following:
a) A landscaping budget as follows:
Land development costs Landscaping Budget
First $250,000 3%
Next $250,000 2%
Thereafter 1%
Reasonable credit shall be given for maintaining significant natural vegetation
existing at the site. After public notice and a hearing, the DRB may reduce such
budget for good cause shown.
b) One (1) major deciduous tree, whose caliper is at least three (3) inches, measured at a
point six (6) inches above finished grade level, shall be planted no nearer than five (5)
feet to any lot line for each three hundred (300) square feet of landscaped area; and one
(1) deciduous shrub or evergreen shall be planted for each two hundred (200) square
feet of landscaped area.
c) Where any land use in a nonresidential district abuts land in a residential district, a strip
of land, at least twenty-five (25) feet in width, shall be maintained as a landscaped area
in the front yard, side yards and rear yard adjoining these other districts, except to the
52
extent, after public notice and hearing, the DRB determines that a lesser buffer is
sufficient to screen non-residential uses from residences.
d) In the Mixed Use, Commercial and Health Services zoning districts, to the extent
feasible, each lot shall have strips of land at least ten (10) feet in width in the front yard
and at least five (5) feet in the side and rear yards, which strips shall be maintained as
a landscaped area.
e) In the Industrial zoning district, to the extent feasible, each lot shall have a strip of land
at least fifteen (15) feet in width in the front yard and at least five (5) feet in width in
the rear and side yards, which strips shall be maintained as a landscaped area.
f) One (1) major deciduous tree, whose caliper is at least three (3) inches measured at a
point six (6) inches above finished grade level, shall be planted as close to every thirty
(30) feet as feasible along any road frontage.
g) New planting species shall be as recommended by the following:
(i) Recommended Trees for Vermont Communities: A Guide to Selecting and
Purchasing Street, Park, and Landscape Trees, published by Vermont Urban
and Community Forestry Program.

411.3 External Landscaping of Parking Areas. Except for parking spaces accessory to a one (1)
family or two (2) family dwelling, all off-street parking areas shall be landscaped with appropriate
trees, shrubs, and other plants including ground covers, as approved by the DRB. The DRB shall
consider the adequacy of the proposed landscaping to assure the establishment of a safe,
convenient, and attractive parking area and the privacy and comfort of abutting properties.
Screening shall be provided where headlights from vehicles on site may be visible and project
parallel to a public street.
411.4 Internal Landscaping of Parking Areas. In all newly reconstructed off-street parking areas
containing twenty (20) or more parking spaces:
a) At least ten (10) percent of the interior of the parking area shall be landscaped with
trees, shrubs, and other plants as follows: At least one (1) major deciduous shade tree,
whose caliper is at least three (3) inches measured at a point six (6) inches above the
finished grade level, shall be provided within each parking area for every three
thousand (3,000) square feet of paved area or every ten (10) parking spaces, whichever
53
ratio results in a greater amount of landscaping. A mix of large canopy tree species
shall be spaced evenly throughout the lot interior to provide shade and reduce glare.
b) Planting islands shall be provided. Such islands and the landscaping within them shall
be designed and arranged in such a way as to define major circulation aisles, entrances,
and exits, to channel internal traffic flow, to prevent indiscriminate diagonal movement
of vehicles, and to provide relief from the visual monotony and shade-less expanse of
a large parking area. All islands shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs, grasses, and/or
ground covers. Curbs of such islands shall be constructed of concrete, stone, or
bituminous material and shall be designed to facilitate surface drainage and prevent
vehicles from overlapping sidewalks and damaging the plants. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, the DRB may allow curb-less parking areas and planting islands that are
designed to provide for storm water run-off into vegetated areas for treatment.
411.5 Landscape Maintenance. All plantings shown on an approved site plan shall be maintained
by the property owner.

(1) and two (2) family dwellings, shall comply with the following:
a) Where used for security purposes or to illuminate walkways, roadways and parking
lots, only shielded light fixtures shall be used.
b) Where used for commercial and industrial purposes such as in merchandise display
areas, work areas, platforms, signs, architectural, landscape or sports or recreational
facilities, all light fixtures shall be equipped with automatic timing devices and
comply with the following:
(i) Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues or any other objects mounted
on a pole, pedestal or platform, shall use a narrow cone beam of light that
will not extend materially beyond the illuminated object.
(ii) Other upward directed architectural, landscape or decorative direct light
emissions shall have at least ninety (90) percent of their total distribution
pattern within the profile of the illuminated structure.
98 1973 Section 322.
99 New 2014
54
(iii) Recreational and sports facility lighting shall be shielded whenever
possible. Such lighting shall have directional and glare control devices,
when necessary, to prevent light trespass.
(iv) All other outdoor lighting shall use shielded light fixtures.
c) All floodlight type fixtures, once properly installed, shall be permanently affixed in
the approved position.
d) Foundations supporting lighting poles not installed four (4) feet behind the curb,
shall not be less than twenty-four (24) inches above ground.
e) When fifty (50) percent or more of existing outdoor light fixtures are being replaced
or modified, then all lighting must be made to conform to the provisions of this
lighting ordinance.
413.2 Light Trespass (Nuisance Light). All light fixtures, except street lighting, shall be
designed, installed and maintained to prevent light trespass, as specified in (a) and (b) below.
a) At a height of five (5) feet above the property line of subject property, illuminations
from light fixtures shall not exceed 0.1 foot candles in a vertical plane on
residentially zoned property.
b) Outdoor light fixtures properly installed and thereafter maintained shall be directed
so that there will not be any objectionable direct glare source visible above a height
of five (5) feet from any property or public roadway.
413.3 Illuminance and Luminance Requirements. Illuminance and luminance requirements shall
be as set forth in the current editions of the IESNA Lighting Handbook and other IESNA
publications.
a) Street lighting  Average IESNA illuminance recommendations should not be
exceeded. IESNA average to minimum illuminance uniformity ratios are to be used
as a guide for designing safe and adequate roadway lighting.
b) Outdoor parking facilities  Outdoor parking lot illuminance shall be based on
certain illuminance specifications recommended by the IESNA, as follows:
Maintained Illuminance for Parking Lots
Basic Enhanced Security
Horizontal Illuminance
Minimum 0.2 fc 0.5 fc
Average 1.0 fc 2.5 fc
55
Uniformity Ratios
Average to Minimum 5:1 5:1
Maximum to Minimum 20:1 15:1
Minimum Vertical Illuminance 0.1 fc 0.25 fc
1. Minimum horizontal illuminance shall be no lower than 0.2 fc.
2. Average horizontal illuminance shall not exceed 2.5 fc.
3. Uniformity ratios are to be used as a guide.
4. Minimum vertical illuminance shall be measured at 5.0 feet above parking surface at the
point of lowest horizontal illuminance, excluding facing outward along boundaries.
5. For typical conditions. During periods of non-use, the illuminance of certain parking
facilities should be turned off or reduced to conserve energy. If reduced lighting is to be
used only for the purpose of property security, it is desirable that the minimum (low point)
not be less than 0.1 fc in susceptible areas of the property. Reductions should not be applied
to facilities subject to intermittent night use, such as apartments, hospitals and active
transportation areas.
6. If personal security or vandalism is a likely and/or severe problem, an increase above the
Basic level may be appropriate.
7. High vehicular traffic locations should generally require the Enhanced Level of
illumination. Exits, entrances, internal connecting roadways and such would be some
examples.
8. Increasing the above illuminance is not likely to increase safety and security. Variance
requests for higher levels will generally be for retail reasons and should not be granted
unless shown to be necessary and at an average illuminance not to exceed 3.6 fc.
413.4 Electric Utility Floodlights. No electric utility flood light intended for property
illumination shall be located within the public right-of-way on any public roadway or on any
property unless the luminaire is sufficiently shielded and aimed so that no objectionable direct
glare source is visible at any point on the roadway where the viewing height is five (5) feet or
greater and when the distance from the mounting pole is seventy (70) feet or greater.
413.5 On Site Outdoor Lighting Energy Conservation. The design and installation of outdoor
lighting on the site of a subdivision or site plan shall be constructed so as to conform to the
standards specified herein.
a) All outdoor lighting not necessary for security purposes shall be reduced, activated
by motion sensor devices or turned off during non-operating hours. Illuminated
signs are excluded from this requirement.
56
b) All lighting shall be designed to prevent misdirected or excessive artificial light and
to maximize energy efficiency.
413.6 Lighting Plan. The following information shall be submitted for review in any site
application proposing the installation of outdoor lighting:
a) Description of outdoor light fixtures including component specifications such as
lamps, reflectors, optics, angle of cutoff, supports, poles, and manufacturers catalog
cuts.
b) Location and description of every outdoor light fixture and hours of operation.
c) Horizontal illuminance shown as foot candles (after depreciation).
(i) Maximum
(ii) Minimum
(iii) Average, during operating and non-operating hours.
(iv) Average to minimum uniformity ratio.
(v) Maximum to minimum uniformity ratio.
d) Computer-generated photometric grid showing foot candle readings every ten (10)
feet and the average foot candles.
e) Foundation details for light poles.
f) When not following IESNA recommendations, a description of reason therefore
and supply supporting documentation.
413.7 Prohibitions. Searchlights or flashing or animated signs are prohibited, other than for a
period of seven (7) days from the date of the opening of a new establishment.
Section 414 Required Storage100

a) Within the triangular area formed by the intersection of two (2) street property lines and a
third line joining them at points twenty-five (25) feet away from their intersection, there
shall be no objects obstructing vision between the height of three (3) feet and ten (10) feet
above the average grade of each street. (See Clear Sight Triangle Definition.) After public
notice and hearing the DRB may waive this requirement to the extent that such waiver does
not materially harm safety.
b) Driveways within the triangular area formed by a street property line and an edge of a
driveway and a third line joining them at fifteen (15) feet away from their intersection,
there shall be no objects obstructing vision between the height of three (3) feet and ten (10)

Section 431 Wireless Communication Facilities108
431.1 Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to all wireless communications
facilities except to the extent limited by federal or state law.
431.2 Permits. Applicants for wireless communications facilities are required to obtain a zoning
permit and a conditional use permit to the extent necessary.
431.3 Locations of Facilities:
a) Zoning districts. Wireless communications facilities will be permitted as a
conditional use in one (1) of the following districts designated on the St. Johnsbury
Zoning Map, in accordance with other provisions of the zoning ordinance:
Rural Lands 1 Industrial
Commercial
Wireless communications facilities may not be approved within any other zoning
district unless location in another district has been clearly demonstrated to be the
only feasible way to provide adequate service; and that the standards and criteria
applicable to conditional uses have been satisfied.
b) Minimizing impact. Due to their importance to the aesthetic quality of the town,
wireless communications facilities may not be placed on the following natural
features: the Knob, Harris Hill, the unnamed hill three fourths (3/4) of a mile southsouthwest
of Harris Hill at the end of Parker Ave., on the ridge abutting Interstate
91 immediately northwest of Interchange 20, and the Town Forest. In addition, no
wireless communication facilities may be placed on Crow Hill, or the two (2)
hilltops north of Crow Hill if they would be visible from the Portland Street Bridge.
The DRB shall have the authority to impose conditions consistent with the purpose
of this section in approving a proposed facility. Furthermore, the DRB may
designate an alternative location for the tower to be evaluated by the applicant if it
is determined that the proposed location would result in undue adverse aesthetic
impacts. In consideration of this, the applicant may revise its application to include
such a site, assuming it is available to the applicant and reasonably technically
feasible to meet the applicant's communication objectives.
Wireless communication facilities will be located so as to minimize the following
potential impacts:
(i) Visual/aesthetic: Wireless communication facilities shall, when possible, be
sited off ridgelines, and where their visual impact is least detrimental to
108 2014 Adapted from 1973 Section 405; adapted for consistency.
60
scenic areas. In determining whether or not a wireless communication
facilities will have undue adverse visual impact on the scenic or natural
beauty the DRB shall consider:
(A) The period of time during which the proposed wireless
communication facilities would be viewed by the public on a public
highway, path, or body of water;
(B) The frequency of the view of the proposed wireless communication
facilities as experienced by the public;
(C) The degree to which the view of the wireless communication
facilities is screened by topographical features;
(D) Background features in the line of sight to the proposed wireless
communication facilities that obscure the facility or make it more
conspicuous;
(E) The distance of the proposed wireless communication facilities from
the viewing vantage point and the proportion of the facility that is
visible above skyline; the number of vehicles and/or viewers
traveling on a public highway, path or waterway at or near the
critical vantage point; and
(F) The sensitivity or unique value of the particular view affected by the
proposed development.
(ii) Property values: The facility will not have an undue adverse impact on
surrounding property values.
(iii) Safety hazards: In the case of structural failure, ice accumulation and
discharge and attractive nuisance.
(iv) Electromagnetic radiation: In the case of wireless communication facilities
is found to exceed the FCC guidelines.
431.4 Permitting Priority. Wireless communication facilities are permitted according to the
following priority:
a) Co-located with an existing wireless communications facility
b) Concealed within existing structures
c) Camouflaged and within an existing structure
d) Camouflaged, or camouflaged on an existing structure such as, but not limited to an
existing electric transmission tower, or an existing radio antenna, a water tower, or
building and of compatible design.
61
e) On land owned by the town which complies with other requirements of this section,
and where visual impact can be minimized and mitigated.
f) If demonstrated to the DRB that each of the above five (5) types of locations is not
feasible, but complies with the other requirements of this section and where visual
impact can be minimized.
431.5 Co-location Requirements. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangements
of antennas on the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights where overall
permitted height allows. Towers shall be designed structurally, electrically and in all respects to
accommodate both the applicants antennas and additional antennas where overall permitted height
allows.
An application for a new telecommunications tower shall not be approved unless the DRB finds
that the facilities planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or
approved tower or structure due to one (1) of the following reasons:
a) The proposed antennas and equipment would exceed the structural or spatial capacity
of the existing or approved tower or facility as documented by a qualified engineer
licensed to practice in the state of Vermont. Additionally, the existing or approved
tower cannot be reinforced, modified or replaced to accommodate planned or
equivalent equipment, at a reasonable cost, to provide coverage and capacity
comparable to that of the proposed facility.
b) The proposed antennas and equipment would cause interference materially impacting
the usefulness of other existing or permitted equipment at the existing or approved
tower or facility as documented by a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the state
of Vermont and such interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
c) The proposed antennas and equipment - either alone or together with existing facilities,
equipment or antennas - would create radio frequency interference (RFI) in violation
of federal standards or requirements.
d) The proposed antennas and equipment either alone or together with existing facilities,
equipment antennas would create radio frequency radiation (RFR) in violation of
federal standards or requirements.
e) Existing or approved towers and structures cannot accommodate the planned
equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably or are too far from the area of
needed coverage to function reasonably as documented by a qualified engineer licensed
to practice in the state of Vermont.
f) Aesthetic reasons make it unreasonable to locate the planned telecommunications
equipment on an existing or approved tower or building.
g) There is no existing or approved tower in the area in which coverage is sought.
62
h) Other unforeseen specific reasons make it unreasonable to locate the planned
telecommunications equipment on an existing or approved tower or building.
431.6 Other provisions and dimensional standards
a) Free-standing telecommunications towers or antennas over thirty-five (35) feet in
elevation may not be located within three hundred (300) feet horizontally from any
historic district or property eligible to be listed on the federal historic register.
b) Free-standing telecommunications towers or antennas over thirty-five (35) feet in
elevation may not be located within three hundred (300) feet horizontally from any
structure existing at the time of the application which is used as either a primary or
secondary residence, the property of any school, or any other building.
c) Free-standing telecommunications towers or antennas over thirty-five (35) feet in
elevation may not be located within three hundred (300) feet horizontally of any river
or perennial stream.
d) Free-standing telecommunications towers or antennas over thirty-five (35) feet in
elevation may not be located within three hundred (300) feet horizontally of any
designated scenic road or highway.
e) Design Compatibility: Equipment shelters and accessory buildings must be designed
to be architecturally similar and compatible with the surrounding area.
f) New Towers: Any new free-standing tower shall be of a monopole construction. New
towers shall not exceed the minimum height necessary to provide adequate coverage
within the town. If attached to an existing structure, the height of the antennas is limited
to no more than twenty (20) feet above the upper elevation, and, in the case of a freestanding
structure, to a maximum of thirty-five (35) feet. Construction of a new tower
that exceeds these height restrictions is not permitted unless the applicant demonstrates
during the permitting process that adequate coverage within the town cannot be met for
the locations permitted.
g) Setback and height: New towers and antennas must be set back from each lot line at
least a distance equal to the height of the tower. The DRB may grant a conditional use
permit to allow a lesser setback.
h) Security, signs, noise and lighting: The area around the wireless communications
facility must be secure from trespass or vandalism. A sign not larger than one (1) square
foot must be posted adjacent to the entry gate indicating the name of the facility
owner(s), a twenty-four (24) hour emergency telephone number, and the presence of
RFR. No advertising is allowed. No lighting is allowed except as required by the federal
aviation administration and except for manually operated emergency lights for use by
operation personnel. The town may impose conditions to minimize the effect of noise
at the site perimeter from the operation of any machinery or equipment.
63
i) Reporting Requirement: Once every two (2) years, and by January 15th (or sooner, if
specified in the permit), the wireless communications carriers must file with the town
information demonstrating that they are in compliance with FCC standards and
requirements regarding RFR. The applicant shall provide a list of RFR readings, their
distances from the tower/transmitter, dates of the readings and the name of the person
or company who took the readings.
j) Removal Requirement: All structures associated with a wireless communications
facility are to be removed within one (1) year of the cessation of use. At the time of
removal, the site must be re-mediated and all equipment removed. If all facilities on a
tower have ceased to operate, the tower (including the foundation) shall also be
removed and the site shall be re-vegetated. The applicant, as a condition of the permit
must provide a financial surety or other form of financial guarantee acceptable to the
town to cover the cost of the removal of the facility and the re-mediation of the
landscape should the facility cease to operate.
k) Justification of Need: If a permit is required for the installation of as wireless
communications facility, the applicant for the permit is required to justify the need for
that facility. The applicant is required to file documentation on the coverage area of the
proposed facility, whether other facilities controlled by the applicant would be capable
of providing the coverage, the capacity of the other facilities controlled by the applicant
that could provide the coverage and whether other technology could be used to increase
the coverage without the necessity of constructing the proposed facility.
l) Contracted Leasers: Documentation that the applicant is not building the proposed
tower on speculation and has contracted leasers for the use of the tower.
m) In addition to information otherwise required in this ordinance, applicants for wireless
communication towers or facilities shall include the following supplemental
information:

The maximum allowable grade shall be ten (10) percent. In no case shall a
grade greater than eight (8) percent be allowed at or within one hundred
fifty (150) feet of an intersection. However, the DRB may authorize on a
cul-de-sac street, a maximum grade not to exceed twelve (12) percent for a
total distance not to exceed nine hundred (900) feet provided that a grade of
not greater than eight (8) percent is permitted at or within one hundred and
fifty (150) feet of an intersection. For grades in excess of eight (8) percent,
the DRB may require safety features as deemed necessary, such as guard
rails and extended shoulders

(vi) Street jogs. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred
twenty-five (125) feet shall not be allowed.
(vii) Street maintenance. Every lot in a subdivision shall be served from a
publicly dedicated road except the DRB may approve access from private
roads upon a showing of suitable provisions for their maintenance.
(viii) Access road. The DRB may require the applicant to improve any access
road to the subdivision to the appropriate street standards provided in these
regulations if such access would otherwise be inadequate, provided that the
town owns or provides the right-of-way.
(ix) Cul-de-sac. A cul-de-sac street shall not exceed twelve hundred (1,200)
feet in length and shall not provide entrance to other streets. However,
where the density is equal to or less than one (1) residential unit for each
two (2) acres, the DRB may increase the maximum length to two thousand
(2,000) feet. When there are six (6) residential units or less on cul-de-sac,
the DRB may modify the pavement width requirements, provided that the
applicant provides adequate off-street parking facilities. A turn-around
shall be provided with a minimum radius of fifty (50) feet at the end of all
cul-de-sacs. In the event that a proposed street and cul-de-sac is not to be
completed to its permanent turn-around at the time that the street is opened,
then and in that event the applicant shall provide a temporary turn-around
at the temporary terminus of said cul-de-sac. No cul-de-sac street shall be
designed to serve more than two hundred (200) lots including those abutting
on it and those abutting on streets served by the cul-de-sac street.
c) The following standards for other features and services:
(i) Curbs, sidewalks and bicycle facilities. Curbs, sidewalks and bicycle
facilities may be required by the DRB as recommended by Complete Streets
 A Guide for Vermont Communities published in September 2012 by the
Vermont Department of Health.
(ii) Water. In any subdivision having off-lot water, the existing public utility
system shall be extended so as to provide, or a community system shall
provide, the necessary quantity of water at acceptable pressure for fire
protection. If the applicant proposes to connect to the town water system,
the DRB may require the applicant to install at the applicants expense,
except as approved by the DRB, larger transmission lines and storage and
95
pumping facilities outside the subdivision if the water supply and pressure
within the subdivision would otherwise be inadequate or to the extent the
subdivisions connection to the towns water system reduces supply and
pressure so that they become inadequate for any user.
(iii) Sewerage. If the subdivision is within one-half (1/2) mile of the town sewer
system, the DRB may require connection to the town sewer system by the
applicant. The applicant may be required by the DRB to provide or to have
installed at the applicants expense, except as approved by the DRB, larger
sewer lines, pumping and other facilities, outside the subdivision if sewer
service within the subdivision would otherwise be inadequate or if the
subdivision connection to the town sewer system causes sewer service to be
reduced so that it is inadequate for any user.
(iv) Electric and communication lines. Electric and communications
distribution systems shall be underground, including services to residences
and to street lights unless waived by the DRB. The applicant shall
coordinate subdivision design with the utility companies to ensure adequate
and suitable area for underground installations.

(viii) Removal of spring and surface water. The applicant may be required by the
DRB to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previous to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements benefitting the town of appropriate width.
(ix) Drainage structure to accommodate potential development. Culverts or
other drainage facilities shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate
potential run-off from the entire subdivision including all land draining into
the subdivision.
(x) Responsibility for drainage downstream. Where the DRB reasonably
anticipates that the additional run-off incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility so that
there will be damage to private property or an increase in the expenditure
of public funds, the DRB shall not approve the subdivision until the
applicant and the select board agree to share the cost of the necessary
improvement required. The towns share shall be based upon the portion of
96
run-off which the developed area downstream from the applicants
subdivision contributes to the necessary improvement, except that there
shall be credited to the towns share that portion of the need which can be
met by existing facilities.
(xi) Other drainage. In design of the drainage system, natural waterways shall
be utilized to the full extent feasible. There shall be at least eighteen (18)
inches of cover over culverts crossing roadways and for culverts over fifteen
(15) inches in diameter the public works director may require additional
depth of cover. The minimum size culvert installed shall be twelve (12)
inches. Where catch basins are installed the street shall have curbing unless
the DRB shall approve an alternate. Open roadside drainage ditches in
excess of a five (5) percent grade shall be paved with stone or asphalt as
required by the DRB. All culverts shall have headers. Header design shall
be approved by the DRB. Wherever possible natural drainage courses shall
be extended across a road and not diverted to roadside drainage ditches.
(xii) Street names. Street names shall be as approved by the select board.
d) The following standards for open space and site preservation:
(i) Land with adequate access to and from public streets, shall be reserved for
open space and recreation area. Such land shall be either deeded to the town
or reserved for the common use of all property owners by covenant in the
deed as approved by the DRB. All area shall be of reasonable size, slope
and character for neighborhood playground or other recreational uses,
including open space. When the proposed density is two (2) residential
units or less for each acre of land within the subdivision ten (10) percent of
the area of the entire subdivision shall be reserved for open space and
recreation area. When the proposed density is greater than two (2)
residential units for each acre of land within the subdivision fifteen (15)
percent of the area of the entire subdivision shall be reserved for open space
and recreation area.
(ii) To the extent the DRB reasonably determines that due to the size,
topography, or location of the subdivision, land for park, playground or
other recreation purposes cannot be properly located therein, the applicant
will pay to the town a sum of money in an amount to be determined by the
select board. This cash payment shall be remitted to the town for either land
acquisition or development of public land for recreational purposes for the
benefit of the residents of the subdivision and the town.
(iii) The DRB may also require the filing of a written agreement between the
applicant and the select board covering future deed and title, dedication, and
provision for the cost of grading, development, equipment, and maintenance
of any such recreation area.
e) The following standards for site preservation and landscaping:
97
(i) Existing features. Existing features which would add value to the
subdivision, such as trees, watercourses and falls, brooks, historic spots and
similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved, insofar as possible, through
harmonious design.
(ii) Natural cover. Land shall be subdivided and improved in reasonable
conformity to existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill,
and to retain, insofar as possible, the natural contours, limit storm water
runoff, and conserve the natural cover and soil. After application for
approval has been submitted to the Board, no topsoil, sand or gravel shall
be removed from the subdivision for any other purpose than to meet
construction needs for that particular subdivision or to meet any
requirements of these regulations.
(iii) Erosion and sediment control. Erosion and sediment shall be controlled
according to standards specified by the State of Vermont Agency of Natural
Resources for projects disturbing more than one (1) acre of ground.
f) The following standards for development in a flood plain, if applicable. When
a development is proposed in any area identified as an area of special flood hazard on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map and the Floodway Map accompanying the Flood Insurance
Study for the Town of St. Johnsbury, Vermont dated July 3, 1986, and now administered
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which are hereby adopted by

terms are associated with Wireless Communication Facilities only.
(a) Adequate coverage: Coverage is adequate within that area surrounding a base
station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmitted
signal is such that the majority of the time transceivers properly installed and
operated will be able to communicate with the base station without objectionable
119
noise (or excessive bit-error rate for digital) and without calls being dropped. In the
case of cellular communications in a rural environment, this would be a signal
strength of at least ninety (90) dBm. It is acceptable for there to be holes within the
area of adequate coverage as long as the signal regains its strength further away
from the base station at the outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage,
however is that location past which the signal does not regain.
(b) Adequate capacity: Capacity is considered adequate if the grade of service is p.05
or better for at least fifty (50) percent of the days in preceding month, prior to the
date of application, as measured using direct traffic measurement of the
telecommunications facility in question, where the call blocking is due to frequency
contention at the antenna(s).
(c) Affiliate: When used in relation to an operator, another person who directly or
indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common
ownership or common control with the operator, or an operators principal partners,

(d) Antenna: A device that is attached to a communications tower or other structure
for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic waves.
(e) Antenna height: The vertical distance measured from the base of the antenna
support structure at grade to the highest point of the structure. If the support
structure is on a sloped grade, then the average between the highest and lowest
grades shall be used in calculating the antenna height.
(f) Antenna support structure: Any pole, telescoping mast, tower tripod, or any
other structure which supports a device used in transmitting and/or receiving of
electromagnetic waves.
(g) Applicant: A person who applies for a telecommunications facility. An applicant

123
(ss) Roof and/or building mount facility: A facility in which antennas are mounted
to an existing structure on the roof (including rooftop appurtenances) or a building
face.
(tt) Radial plots (see also tiled coverage plots): Radial plots are the result of drawing
equally-spaced fines (radials) from the point of the antenna, calculating the
expected signal and indicating this graphically on a map. The relative signal
strength may be indicated by varying the size or color at each point being studied
along the radial. A threshold plot uses a mark to indicate whether the point would
be strong enough to provide adequate coverage i.e. the points meeting the threshold
of adequate coverage. The drawback is the concentration of points close to the
antenna and the divergence of points far from the site near the ends of the radials.
(uu) Radiated-signal propagation studies of coverage plots: Computer generated
estimates of the signal emanating and prediction of coverage from antennas or
repeaters sited on a specific tower or structure. The height above ground, power
input and output, frequency output, type of antenna, antenna gain, topography or
the site and its surroundings are all taken into account to create these simulations.
They are the primary tools for determining whether the telecommunications
equipment will provide adequate coverage for that site.
(vv) Repeater: A small receiver/relay transmitter and antenna of relatively low power
output designed to provide service to areas which are not able to receive adequate
coverage directly from a base or primary station.
(ww) Scenic view: A scenic view is a wide angle or panoramic field of sight and may
include natural and/or manmade structures and activities. A scenic view may be
from a stationary viewpoint or be seen as one travels along a roadway, waterway,
or path. A view may be to a faraway object, such as a mountain, or a nearby object.
(xx) Self-supporting tower: A communications tower that is constructed without guy
wires.
(yy) Spectrum: Relating to any transmission or reception of electromagnetic waves.
(zz) Structurally able: The determination that a tower or structure is capable of
carrying the load imposed by the proposed new antennas under all reasonable
predictable conditions as determined by professional structural engineering
analysis.
(aaa) Telecommunications facility: All equipment (including repeaters) and locations
of equipment with which a telecommunications provider transmits and receives the
waves which carry their services. This facility may be sited on one (1) or more
towers or structure(s) owned and permitted by the provider or another owner or
entity.
(bbb) Telecommunications provider: An entity licensed by the FCC to provide
telecommunications services to individuals of institutions.
124
(ccc) Temporary wireless communication facility: Any tower, pole, antenna, etc.
designed for use while a permanent wireless facility is under construction, or for a
special event or conference where a majority of people attending are wireless users.
(ddd) Tiled coverage plots (see also radial plots): Tiled plots result from calculating
the signal at the uniformly-spaced locations on a rectangular grid, or tile, of the area
of concern. Unlike radial plots, tiled plots provide a uniform distribution of points
over the area of interest; usually the same grid will be used as different sites are
examined, and it is not necessary that the transmitter site be within the grid or area
of interest. As with radial plots, the graphic display or plot can be either signal
strength or adequate threshold. This method requires substantially more
topographic data and longer computer execution time than radial plots, but is
preferable for comparative analysis.
(eee) Tower: A vertical structure that provides telecommunications services.
(fff) Whip antenna: A vertical antenna that normally transmits signals in three hundred
sixty (360) degrees. Whip antennas are typically cylindrical in shape, narrow (less
than six (6) inches in diameter) and long (often measuring eighteen (18) inches in
height or more). Also called omnidirectional, stick or pipe antennas.
(ggg) View corridor: A three-(3)-dimensional area extending out from a viewpoint. The
width of the view corridor depends on the focus of the view. The focus of the view
may be a single object, such as a mountain, which would result in a narrow corridor,
or a group of objects, such as a downtown skyline, which would result in a wide
corridor. Panoramic views have very wide corridors and may include a three
hundred sixty (360) degree perspective. Although the view corridor extends from
the viewpoint to the focus of the view, the mapped portion of the corridor extends
from the viewpoint and is based on the area where base zone heights must be limited
in order to protect the view.
Y
Yard sales: Sales, including garage sales and flea markets, to the general public of new and used
items of personal property conducted upon a lot as an accessory use for not more than twelve (12)
days in any one (1) calendar year. Sales carried on for more than five (5) consecutive days must
secure a permit from the Zoning Administrator.
