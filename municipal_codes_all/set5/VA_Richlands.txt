ARTICLE 3 - RESIDENTIAL, GENERAL, DISTRICT R-2 
 
Statement of Intent 
 
This district is composed of certain medium to high concentration of residential uses, ordinarily located between residential and commercial areas, plus certain open areas where similar development appears likely to occur.  The regulations for this district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential characteristics of the district, to promote and encourage, insofar as compatible with the intensity of land use, a suitable environmental for family life composed of an adult population with some children, and to permit certain commercial uses of a character unlikely to develop general concentration of traffic, crowds of customers and general outdoor advertising.  To these ends, retail activity is sharply limited and this district is protected against encroachment of general commercial or industrial uses.  All residential types of structures for both permanent and transient occupancy and including institutions are permitted plus structures for commercial uses conforming to the pattern of the district.  This residential district is not completely residential as it includes public and semipublic, institutional and other related uses.  However, it is basically residential in character, and, as such, should not be spotted with commercial and industrial uses.

8-8-1: Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission, the Richlands  
Town Council shall, after consideration of the foregoing factors, make an independent determination as to whether the zoning and conditional use permits should be granted and, if so, the conditions under which they should. In arriving at their determination, the Richlands Town Council intends, through the exercise of its police power, to ensure that the most appropriate use of land is made while, at the same time, not arbitrarily depriving the owner of the beneficial use thereof. 
 
8-8-2: Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is hereby prohibited within the corporate limits of the Town of Richlands, the placement and erection of stacked or “double-decker” types of general advertising and business signs.

9-2-2. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, when, owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions will result in unnecessary hardship; provided that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done, as follows: 




 
When a property owner can show that his property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the effective date of the ordinance, or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of the ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property or where the board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of the ordinance.  
 
No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds:  (a) that the strict application of the ordinance would produce undue hardship;  (b) that such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity; and (c) that the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance. 
 
No such variance shall be authorized except after notice and hearing as required by Section 15.1-431 of the Code of Virginia 1950, as amended. 
 
No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the ordinance. 
 
In authorizing a variance the board may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure for use as it may deem necessary in the public interest, and may require a guarantee or bond to insure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
' 151.001 PURPOSE.
(A) This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to localities by VA Code ' 15.2-2280.
(B) The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of life and property, the creation of health
and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and
unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base
by:
(1) Regulating uses, activities and development which, alone or in combination with other
existing or future uses, activities and development will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights,
velocities and frequencies;
(2) Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development from locating within
districts subject to flooding;
(3) Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur in flood-prone districts to
be protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and flood damage; and
(4) Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazards.
(Ord. passed - -)
' 151.002 APPLICABILITY.
This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the town and identified as being
flood-prone by the Federal Insurance Administration.

reconstructed enlarged or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of
this chapter and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction
of this chapter.
(B) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Large floods may occur
on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that districts outside the floodplain
district, or that land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages.
(C) Records of actions associated with administering this chapter shall be kept on file and maintained
by the Zoning Administrator.
(D) This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the town or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

underlying ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that its provisions are more
restrictive than this chapter.
(Ord. passed - -)
' 151.005 SEVERABILITY.
If any section, division, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter shall be declared invalid
for any reason whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this chapter. The
remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect; and for this purpose, the provisions of this chapter
are hereby declared to be severable.

indicates or requires a different meaning.
12 Richlands - Land Usage
BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The Federal Emergency Management Agency designated 100-
year water surface elevation (plus one foot). The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the
datum specified on the community=s flood insurance rate map. For the purposes of this chapter, the 100-
year flood or 1% annual chance flood.
BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.
BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS. The Board appointed to review appeals made by individuals with
regard to decisions of the Zoning Administrator in the interpretation of this chapter.
DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but
not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations or storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING. A non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the
ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings or columns (posts and piers).
ENCROACHMENT. The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings,
permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a
floodplain.
FLOOD.
(1) A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land
areas from:
(a) The overflow of inland or tidal waves;
(b) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from any source; and
(c) Mud slides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in
division (1)(b) above of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
(2) The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result
of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or
suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or by some similarly unusual and
unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in division (1)(a) above of this definition.
Floodplains 13
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which the
Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community. A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map
(DFIRM).
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). An examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards
and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and
determination of mudflow and/or flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property,
water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water
from any source.
FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
more than one foot.
FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of
floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could
contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings and the hydrological effect of urbanization in the
watershed. When a FREEBOARD is included in the height of a structure, the flood insurance premiums
may be cheaper.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to

ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
' 151.020 DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICTS.
(A) Basis of districts.
(1) The various floodplain districts shall include special flood hazard areas. The basis for the
delineation of these districts shall be the flood insurance study (FIS) and the flood insurance rate maps
(FIRM) for the town prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated February 18, 2011,
and any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto.
(2) The boundaries of the special flood hazard area and floodplain districts are established as
shown on the flood insurance rate map which is declared to be a part of this chapter and which shall be kept
on file at the town offices.
(a) The floodway district is delineated, for purposes of this chapter, using the criterion that
certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the 100-year flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. The areas included in
this district are specifically defined in Table 1 of the above-referenced flood insurance study and shown on
the accompanying flood insurance rate map.
(b) The special floodplain district shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the maps
accompanying the flood insurance study for which 100-year flood elevations have been provided.
(c) The approximated floodplain district shall be those areas identified as an A or A99 Zone
on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study. In these zones, no detailed flood profiles or
elevations are provided, but the 100-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. For these areas, the
100-year flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state and other acceptable sources shall
be used, when available. Where the specific 100-year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area
other sources of data, such as the United States Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports,
United States Geological Survey Flood-prone Quadrangles and the like, then the applicant for the proposed
use, development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
Floodplains 17
computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a through review by the governing
body.
(B) Overlay concept.
(1) The floodplain districts described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying districts
as shown on the official zoning ordinance map, and as such, the provisions for the floodplain districts shall
serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions.
(2) Any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the floodplain districts and those of
any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the floodplain districts
shall apply.
(3) In the event any provision concerning a floodplain district is declared inapplicable as a result
of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying provisions shall remain
applicable.

' 151.021 DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGES.
The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the Town Council, where natural
or human-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or
undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual
documents the need for such change. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from
the Federal Insurance Administration.
(Ord. passed - -)
' 151.022 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the Zoning Officer.
Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
make the necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the district
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case to the Board and to submit his
or her own technical evidence if he or she so desires.
(Ord. passed - -)
' 151.023 SUBMITTING TECHNICAL DATA.
A community=s base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes
affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator of the
18 Richlands - Land Usage
changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a submission is necessary so that upon
confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements will be based upon current data.

administrative officer in the administration or enforcement of this chapter or of any ordinance adopted
pursuant thereto; and
(B) To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the chapter as will not
be contrary to the public interest, when, owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions
will result in unnecessary hardship; provided that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed and substantial
justice done, as follows.
(1) When a property owner can show that his or her property was acquired in good faith and
where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at
the time of the effective date of the enactment of the chapter, or where by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use
or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of the chapter
would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property or where the Board is satisfied,
upon the evidence heard by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable
hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the
applicant, provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of the
chapter.

reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the
chapter.
