Additional time required to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify the information request, locate and assemble the information requested, or determine whether any of the information requested is exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request. In acknowledging receipt of a public record request that is unclear, the city clerk may ask the requesting party to clarify what information is being sought.

2.10.300 Findings on order regarding public records index.

A.    The Revised Code of Washington (“RCW”) requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of all public records.

B.    The RCW also states that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, or interfere with agency operation, a city must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

C.    When such an order is made, all indexes maintained by that city must be made available to provide identifying information on those records which are available for inspection and/or copying.

D.    The city of Centralia is comprised of ten departments, their divisions and subdivisions, which maintain separate databases and/or record-keeping systems for the indexing of records and information.

E.    Because the city has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems and databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a central index of records.

F.    The city will fully comply with the provisions of the RCW as they relate to the Public Disclosure Act, under Chapter 42.56 RCW. (Ord. 2390 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2213 § 1 (part), 2008).


2.10.350 Order regarding public records index.

Based upon the findings set forth in CMC 2.10.300, and pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4)(a), the city council orders the following:

A.    The city of Centralia is not required to maintain an all-inclusive index of public records, due to findings of the city council that the requirement is unduly burdensome and such a list is nearly impossible to create and/or maintain.

B.    The city of Centralia shall make available all public records and any indexes created for internal use upon request by any citizen. Said indexes shall be maintained and released in order to obtain those records which are public and not protected by the exemption portion of the statutes, namely Chapter 42.56 RCW. (Ord. 2390 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2213 § 1 (part), 2008).


2.10.400 Order regarding calculating actual cost for fees charged.

A.    The city finds that calculating the actual costs associated with providing public records is unduly burdensome for the following reasons:

1.    Quantifying certain necessary resources (ink, electricity, wear and tear on equipment) is inherently difficult;

2.    Funds were not allocated for performing a study to calculate actual costs;

3.    Staff resources are insufficient to perform a study and to calculate actual costs;

4.    A study would interfere with and disrupt essential city functions; and

B.    Fees are consistent with the amounts established by state law. (Ord. 2390 § 1 (part), 2017).

B.    Process for Designating Properties or Districts to the City of Centralia’s Local Register.

1.    Property owners may nominate a building, structure, site, object, or district for inclusion in the city of Centralia’s local register. Members of the historic preservation commission or the commission as a whole may generate nominations. In its designation decision, the commission shall consider the city of Centralia’s inventory and the city of Centralia’s comprehensive plan.

3.    In the case of districts, the designation shall include descriptions of the boundaries of the district; the characteristics of the district which justify its designation; and a list of all contributing properties including features, structures, sites, and objects.

4.    The historic preservation commission shall consider the merits of the nomination, according to the criteria in subsection (A) of this section and according to the nomination review standards established in rules, at a public meeting. Adequate notice will be given to the public, the owner(s) and the authors of the nomination, if different, and lessees, if any, of the subject property prior to the public meeting according to standards for public meetings established in rules and in compliance with Chapter 42.30 RCW, Open Public Meetings Act. Such notice shall include publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of Centralia and posting of the property.

5.    In the case of historic districts, the commission shall consider a simple majority (fifty-one percent) of property owners to be adequate for owner consent. Owner consent and notification procedures in the case of districts shall be further defined in the bylaws. The public, property owner(s) and the authors of the nomination, if different, and lessees, if any, shall be notified of the listing.

6.    Properties listed on the city of Centralia’s local register shall be recorded on official zoning records with an “HR” (for historic register) designation. This designation shall not change or modify the underlying zone classification.

The council of the city finds that it is in the city’s best interest to establish a system of registering the ownership of the city’s bonds and obligations in the manner permitted by law. (Ord. 1547 § 2, 1984).


3.18.030 Adoption of registration system.

The city adopts the following system of registering the ownership of its bonds and obligations:

A.    Registration Requirement. All bonds and obligations offered to the public, having a maturity of more than one year and issued by the city after June 30, 1983, on which the interest is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation, shall be registered as to both principal and interest as provided in this chapter.

B.    Method of Registration. The registration of all city bonds and obligations required to be registered shall be carried out either by:

1.    A book entry system of recording the ownership of the bond or obligation on the books of the city or the fiscal agencies, whether or not a physical instrument is issued; or

2.    By recording the ownership of the bond or obligation and requiring as a condition of the transfer of ownership of any bond or obligation the surrender of the old bond or obligation and either the reissuance of the old bond or obligation or the issuance of a new bond or obligation to the new owners.

No transfer of any bond or obligation subject to registration requirements shall be effective until the name of the new owner and the new owner’s mailing address, together with such other information deemed appropriate by the registrar, shall be recorded on the books of the registrar.

C.    Denominations. Except as may be provided otherwise by the ordinance authorizing their issuance, registered bonds or obligations may be issued and reissued in any denomination up to the outstanding principal amount of the bonds or obligations of which they are a part. Such denominations may represent all or part of a maturity or several maturities and on reissuance may be in smaller amounts than the individual denominations for which they are reissued.

D.    Appointment of Registrar. Unless otherwise provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of registered bonds or obligations, the city clerk-treasurer shall be the registrar for all registered interest-bearing warrants, installment contracts, interest-bearing leases and other registered bonds or obligations not usually subject to trading and the fiscal agencies shall be the registrar for all other city bonds and obligations.

E.    Duties of Registrar. The registrar shall serve as the city’s authenticating trustee, transfer agent, registrar and paying agent for all registered bonds and obligations for which he, she, or it serves as registrar and shall comply fully with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations respecting the carrying out of those duties.

The rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation of the registrar shall be prescribed in each ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds or obligations, which rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation shall be embodied in a contract executed by the city clerk-treasurer and the registrar.

In instances when the fiscal agencies serve as registrar, the city adopts by reference the contract between the State Finance Committee of the state of Washington and the fiscal agencies in lieu of executing a separate contract and prescribing by ordinance the rights, duties, obligations and compensation of the registrar. As well, when the city clerk-treasurer serves as registrar, a separate contract shall not be required.

5.44.010 Purpose, findings, intent and scope.

A.    Purpose. The purpose of requiring standards for adult entertainment businesses is to mitigate the adverse secondary effects caused by such businesses, to maintain compatibility with other land uses and services permitted within the city, and to promote the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.

B.    Findings.

1.    Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation, significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred in and around such businesses. This history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution, illegal employment of minors, narcotics trafficking and use, alcoholic beverage law violations, breaches of the peace, tax evasion, and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests, outstanding arrest warrants, and past criminal behavior related to the adult entertainment industry which may be indicative of intended future conduct;

2.    There is convincing evidence in the form of studies, court cases, and police records reviewed and considered by the city, on file with the city clerk, that adult entertainment businesses have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses around them and surrounding residential areas or other sensitive uses adjacent to them, causing increased crime, harm to minors, diminishing the quality of residential life, and reducing property values;

3.    The activities defined and regulated in this chapter have been shown to produce secondary effects which are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and, therefore, such activities must be regulated;

4.    Adult entertainment businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other and other sensitive uses, thereby contributing to urban blight and devaluating the quality of life in adjacent areas;

5.    Close physical proximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances facilitates sexual contact, prostitution, and related crimes. Concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city, which require reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens;

6.    In the absence of regulation, the criminal activities described in subsections (B)(1) and (5) of this section occur whether or not the sale of alcoholic beverages takes place in conjunction with adult entertainment activities;

7.    It is necessary to license adult entertainment premises to identity the location and nature of activities to take place on such premises, to identify the operators of each such business, and to provide for the regulations of such premises;

8.    It is necessary to license managers in the adult entertainment industry, and to have a licensed manager on the premises of adult entertainment premises, so there will at all necessary times be an identifiable individual responsible for the overall operation of the adult entertainment establishment, including responsibility for the actions of entertainers, other employees, and patrons;

9.    It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors, to ensure that each entertainer is an adult, and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible; and

10.    The license fees required in this chapter are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to partially defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry.

C.    Intent.

1.    The city council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; protect minors from exposure to inappropriate content; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight;

2.    It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment, but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses through time, place, and manner regulations; and

3.    It is not the intent of the city council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the city council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the city.

D.    Scope. The standards established in this chapter apply to all adult entertainment businesses and include, but are not limited to, the following: adult panorams, adult cabarets, adult motels, adult motion picture theaters, and adult retail establishments. (Ord. 2094 § 1 (part), 2002).

5.    Whether or not activity is obscene shall be judged by consideration of the following factors:

a.    Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the activity taken as a whole appeals to a purient interest in sex;

b.    Whether the activity depicts or describes in a patently offensive way, as measured against community standards, sexual conduct as described in RCW 7.48A.010(2)(b); and

c.    Whether the activity taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

C.    For the licensing provisions of this chapter only, each type of adult entertainment business defined in this chapter which may include, but not be limited to an adult cabaret, adult panoram, adult theater or adult retail establishment shall constitute a separate adult entertainment business even if operated in conjunction with another adult entertainment business at the same establishment.

7.12.060 Declaration of potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog—Procedure and notification requirements.

A.    The city of Centralia animal control shall identify and classify potentially dangerous dogs and dangerous dogs. The Centralia animal control may find and declare a dog potentially dangerous or dangerous if the animal control officer has probable cause to believe that the dog falls within the definitions set forth in CMC 7.12.020(B) or (C). Probable cause may be based upon:

1.    The written complaint of a citizen who is willing to testify that he or she witnessed the dog acting in a manner which causes it to fall within the definition of potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog;

2.    Dog bite reports filed with the Centralia animal control;

3.    Actions of the dog witnessed by any animal control officer or law enforcement officer; or

4.    Other substantial evidence.

B.    Upon determining that probable cause exists to believe that a dog is potentially dangerous or dangerous, the Centralia animal control may issue a written notice to the owner of the dog. The notice shall contain the following:

1.    The name and address of the owner of the dog;

2.    A brief description and, if available, a picture of the dog;

3.    A brief statement of why the dog has been found to be a potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog;

4.    The specific provision or provisions of CMC 7.12.020(B) or (C) under which the animal control officer has found the dog to be a potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog;

5.    The requirements for restraint of the dog, if applicable, as determined by the Centralia animal control, and when these requirements must be complied with;

6.    The criminal penalty for violation of the requirements for restraint imposed by the Centralia animal control, including a statement that, if the requirements are not timely met, the Centralia animal control has the authority to issue a criminal citation or report such noncompliance to the Centralia city attorney’s office, which has the authority to initiate a criminal action;

7.    A statement advising:

a.    The owner of their rights;

b.    That the notice may be appealed including the appellate process;

c.    That the failure to file a timely and complete notice of appeal will constitute a waiver of all rights to an appeal under this chapter; and

8.    A statement that the dog is subject to registration and controls in CMC 7.12.040(B).

C.    The notice shall be served on the owner in one of the following methods:

1.    First class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner’s last known address; or

2.    Personally. If the notice is personally served, proof of personal service of the notice shall be made by a written declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the person effecting service, declaring the time, date and manner in which service was made.

a.    “Personal service” means handing it to the owner’s attorney or to the owner; or leaving it at their office with their clerk or other person in charge thereof; or, if there is no one in charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or, if the office is closed or the owner has no office, leaving it at their dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein.

3.    When the animal control authority issues its final determination, the authority shall notify the owner in writing that he or she is entitled to an opportunity to meet with the authority, at which meeting the owner may give, orally or in writing, any reasons or information as to why the dog should not be declared dangerous. The notice shall state the date, time, and location of the meeting, which must occur prior to expiration of fifteen calendar days following delivery of the notice. The owner may propose an alternative meeting date and time, but such meeting must occur within the fifteen-day time period set forth in this section. After such meeting, the authority must issue its final determination, in the form of a written order, within fifteen calendar days. In the event the authority declares a dog to be dangerous, the order shall include a recital of the authority for the action, a brief concise statement of the facts that support the determination, and the signature of the person who made the determination. The order shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivered in person to the owner at the owner’s last address known to the authority. (Ord. 2125 § 1 (part), 2004).


7.12.070 Appeal of notice of potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog.

A.    Any owner of a dog which has been declared potentially dangerous or dangerous by the Centralia animal control pursuant to CMC 7.12.060 may appeal the notice by filing at the municipal court of the city of Centralia, within twenty days from receiving the final determination, a written notice of appeal. Said written notice of appeal shall be on a form provided for that purpose by the Centralia animal control or other written notice, but must contain the following items:

H.    1. Dogs shall not be declared potentially dangerous or dangerous by the hearing examiner if a threat, injury, or damage sustained by a person forms the probable cause to believe the dog is potentially dangerous or dangerous, and the threat, injury, or damage was sustained by a person who, at the time, was committing a wilful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner of the dog, or was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog or has, in the past, been observed or reported to have tormented, abused, or assaulted the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime.

2.    At the hearing, the animal control officer shall have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that one or more of the circumstances set forth in subsection (H)(1) of this section exists. The owner of the animal may present evidence in defense of the animal.

3.    Subsection (H)(1) of this section shall not apply if the dog is believed to be a potentially dangerous dog pursuant to CMC 7.12.060(B)(3).

I.    1. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing examiner shall weigh the evidence presented by both the animal control officer and the owner and issue a written decision.

An appeal must be filed with the hearing examiner’s office within twenty-one days of receiving notice of the confiscation. An appeal shall not proceed until the owner has paid all costs associated with housing of the inherently dangerous animal if applicable. The owner shall pay shelter costs in five-day increments. If the owner fails to remain current on payment of shelter costs, the appeal shall be terminated and the animal control authority shall, at its discretion, either euthanize the inherently dangerous animal in an expeditious and humane manner or give the animal to a licensed animal refuge facility.

A decision of the hearing examiner may be appealed to the Lewis County superior court within twenty-one days of the decision being issued. The animal control authority shall refrain from euthanizing an inherently dangerous animal or giving the animal to a licensed animal refuge facility pending a decision of the hearing examiner or the issuance of a restraining order from superior court.

10.30.030 Violations—Abatement.

A.    Investigation of Complaint. Upon receipt of information or upon personal observation that a nuisance exists as defined in this chapter, the enforcement officer shall cause an investigation of the matter and premises involved. All entries upon premises for the purpose of this chapter shall be subject to subsection (I) of this section.

B.    Abatement Procedure. After having made a finding that a nuisance exists, the enforcement officer shall require the owner of the premises involved, as listed by the Lewis County assessor’s office, to abate the nuisance at his or her own cost and expense, in whole or in part. The enforcement officer shall give written notice to the owner describing the property involved, the condition to be corrected, and a specified reasonable time within which the owner must correct the condition, which shall not be less than fourteen days from the date of service by mail as evidenced by the postmark on the notice. In the event of an emergency condition, of which the enforcement officer shall be the sole judge, the time of compliance may be reduced to twenty-four hours. The notice must further specify:

1.    That if the owner fails to abate the nuisance within the specified period of time, the city shall cause the work to be performed and shall assess all or any portion of the cost thereof against the owner;

2.    That the owner may be liable for civil penalties for each day or part of day that the condition continues to exist following the notice; and

3.    That the owner additionally may be liable to criminal prosecution, as provided in this chapter.

C.    Service of Notice of Violation. The notice given by the enforcement officer to the owner shall be deposited in the United States Mail by certified mail with a return receipt requested or shall be personally served by delivering a copy thereof to the owner or by leaving the same with a person of suitable age (eighteen years or older) and discretion at the owner’s place of residence. If the owner is not a resident of the city, the notice shall be served by leaving the same with the tenant in possession of the property or, if there is no such tenant, by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the property involved, and by mailing a copy thereof to the owner at his or her last known address as listed by the Lewis County assessor’s office, if any. Service by mail will be deemed complete at the end of the third full day following its deposit in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid.

D.    Failure to Comply with Notice of Violation. After the time for compliance and a notice of violation has expired, the code enforcement officer shall reinspect the premises and determine if the violation has been abated as required in the notice of violation. In the event of no action or insufficient action to abate the violation, the code enforcement officer may take any and all means necessary to enforce the applicable code, including but not limited to: issuance of civil infractions, issuance of criminal citations, commencement of civil, criminal, and equitable proceedings with the assistance of the city attorney to abate a nuisance and have the nuisance abated by the city.

E.    Liability for Costs of Abatement. The property owner shall be liable for all costs and expenses associated with a nuisance abatement conducted by the city of any building, structure or on the premises. In all cases where the city abates any such nuisance, the enforcement officer shall keep an account of all costs and expenses attending such abatement. The amount of the cost of such abatement shall be assessed against the real property upon which such cost was incurred unless such amount is previously paid. Upon certification to the Lewis County treasurer by the finance director of the city of Centralia, the treasurer shall enter the amount of such assessment upon the tax rolls against the property for the current year and the same shall become a part of the general taxes for that year to be collected at the same time and with interest at such rates and in such manner as provided for delinquent taxes, and when collected to be deposited to the credit of the general fund of the municipality. The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property which shall be of equal rank with state, county and municipal taxes.

10.45.010 Purpose.

The Centralia city council finds and declares that the ability to feel safe and secure in one’s own home and in one’s own community is of primary importance. The city council hereby finds and declares that it is the right of every person, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, gender, age, or handicap, to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. It is not the intent of this chapter to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association. The city council hereby recognizes the constitutional right of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any lawful subject, to lawfully associate with others who share similar beliefs on any lawful subject, to petition lawfully constituted authority for redress of perceived grievances, and to participate in the electoral process.

The city council, however, further finds and recognizes that criminal street gangs promote crime and jeopardize the health, safety, and welfare of citizens of the city of Centralia. The city council finds that the city of Centralia is in a state of crisis which has been caused by violent street gangs whose members threaten, terrorize, and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhood. These activities, both individually and collectively, present a clear and present danger to public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected.

The city council finds that there are approximately fifty adult and two hundred juvenile criminal street gang members operating in the city of Centralia, and that the number of criminal street gang related offenses is increasing. Criminal street gang activities jeopardize the life and health of residents, result in damage to property, cause public disturbances, create numerous calls for police service and assistance, and deplete the revenues available for promotion of the public welfare. It is the intent of the city council in enacting this chapter to seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs, which together are the chief source of terror created by street gangs. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the community with a tool that will help residents to restore the health, safety and quiet enjoyment of their community. (Ord. 2214 § 2 (part), 2008).

13.02.010 Liens—Owner responsibility.

In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 35.21 RCW, cities and towns owning their own waterworks, or electric light or power plants, shall have a lien against the premises to which water, electric light, or power services were furnished, and Chapter 35.67 RCW, cities and towns owning their own sewer systems shall have a lien for delinquent and unpaid rates and charges for sewer service. Regardless of the occupancy, if premises and/or structures are served by the water, electric, storm and surface water, and/or sewer systems, the owner shall be responsible for payment of all utility service charges arising out of provision of such service to the owner’s premises/structures. Unpaid charges shall constitute a continuing lien upon the property until such charges have been paid in full. The city may enforce the lien by shutting off and not restoring water, electric, storm and surface water, and/or sewer until all delinquent and unpaid charges are paid in full. The city may also employ other legal remedies such as collection agencies, small claims court or superior court to collect the unpaid amount from the property owner. (Ord. 2408 § 1, 2018: Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.020 Deposits.

A.    Deposits for water, electric, storm and surface water, and/or sewer systems are not required by the city with the following exception:

Utility security deposits shall be required in the case of an owner’s bankruptcy and continuation of utility services is desired. The deposit shall be based on the two highest usage months within a twenty-four-month period.

B.    The absence of a city required utility deposit does not preclude a property owner from requiring their tenant to make a deposit with the city. Such deposit shall be non-interest bearing and retained in a separate account designated as the “utility deposit account.” Any such deposit will be applied to the final bill with any amount remaining refunded. Regardless of deposits, the city shall have a lien against the property as described in CMC 13.02.010. (Ord. 2408 § 2, 2018: Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.030 Billing.

For premises/structures served by water, electric, storm and surface water, and/or sewer systems, the property owner shall receive and be responsible for the bill. Upon written application, a property owner may request that the city establish a utility billing account for their tenant. Bills sent to the tenant are for the convenience of the owner and in no way alter the city’s lien against the property as described in CMC 13.02.010. (Ord. 2408 § 3, 2018: Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.040 Payment of service—Late penalty.

All billings for water, electric, storm and surface water, and/or sewer shall be on a monthly basis and are due and payable when issued. Failure to receive the utility bill for any reason shall not be a valid defense for failure to pay the full amount due. If payment in full is not received by the close of business on the date specified on the bill, a penalty of ten percent of the current amount due will be added. (Ord. 2408 § 4, 2018: Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.050 Denial of utility service.

The city reserves the right to deny service to any party who has an outstanding unpaid utility account with the city. (Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.060 Service subject to disconnection.

Utility services shall be subject to disconnection by the city manager or designee without obligation upon the city to refund or repay any consideration which may have been given for the granting of such service and without any obligation upon the city whatsoever for any one or more of the following reasons:

A.    Failure to comply with this chapter and/or applicable rules and regulations of the city;

B.    Use of the utility system for purposes not authorized by the city;

C.    Nonpayment involving two or more users from one line. Where two or more users are supplied with a utility from the same service line, if any of the users fail to pay the utility service charges when due, the city reserves the right to suspend all services until such charges are paid. No claims may be made against the city by any user whose utility charges have been paid because of such disconnection. It is expressly stipulated that the necessity for such disconnection shall be deemed to be the joint act of all served through such service;

D.    Any emergency requiring the interruption of service as determined by the city manager or designee or the responsible department head. (Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.070 Notice of disconnection of service.

Delinquent accounts are mailed disconnect notices, with copies to property owners for rental property, stating the amount due and date by which payment in full must be received to avoid disconnection. No further notice will be provided.

Utility service will be disconnected due to non-sufficient funds (NSF). Notification shall be in the form of a door hanger at the property and will state that utilities will be disconnected by noon on the next business day if payment in full in the form of cash, cashier’s check or money order is not received. (Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.080 Disconnection of service—Service fee.

If a past-due account is not paid in full by the close of business on the date specified on the disconnect notice, a disconnect service order will be issued and utilities will be disconnected as soon as possible. City of Centralia employees are not authorized to accept payment at the service address in lieu of disconnection. Additional service fees will be charged to the account if it becomes necessary to disconnect and restore services. A minimum service fee of twenty-five dollars will be charged during regular working hours. Regular working hours for city light are defined as seven a.m. to three-thirty p.m. Monday through Friday, not including holidays. A minimum service fee of one hundred fifty dollars will be charged for all other hours. Regardless of time of service, if the city cannot access the electric meter for the purpose of disconnecting and/or servicing it at the meter, the city will perform the work at the supply or service point using additional equipment and staff. If this occurs, the customer will be charged actual costs, with a minimum service fee of one hundred fifty dollars. The service fees shall be reviewed and changed as needed based on actual costs. No service fee shall be charged for disconnection or reconnection when accomplished for the convenience of the city. (Ord. 2246 § 1, 2010: Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.090 Reconnection of service.

Utilities disconnected will be reconnected upon payment in full of the delinquent amount and all service fees. Payment in full on disconnected accounts received by three-thirty p.m. on a regular business day will be reconnected on that same day. Payment in full on disconnected accounts received between three-thirty p.m. and five p.m. will be reconnected on the next business day unless the additional all other hours service fee is paid. (Ord. 2130 § 1, 2004: Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).


13.02.100 Informal conference and payment arrangements.

Anyone who disputes the amount of their bill, or believes that service should not be disconnected, shall have the right to an informal conference with a designated employee of the city. The conference may be held in person at the customer service center or via telephone on any business day prior to the date indicated for disconnection. All payment arrangements must be approved prior to the date indicated for disconnection. (Ord. 2130 § 1, 2004: Ord. 2092 § 1 (part), 2002).

(Ord. 1607 § 1 (part), 1987).


13.03.020 Written request.

Within ten days of the billing date, any utility customer of the city of Centralia feeling aggrieved by a utility billing may seek adjustment of such city utility billing by filing with the Centralia city manager a written adjustment request stating specifically the billing in question, the nature of the adjustment sought and the reasons therefor. Any documentation, records or data the customer believes supports such request shall accompany the written adjustment request or be deemed waived by the customer.

13.03.030 Condition precedent.

At or before the time such written request is filed with the city manager, the customer shall pay all amounts due the city under the billing in question. Failure to do so shall cause the automatic and immediate denial of such request. (Ord. 1607 § 1 (part), 1987).


13.03.040 Adjustment credit/refund.

In the event the city manager determines an adjustment is appropriate, the amount of the adjustment shall be credited to the customer’s next billing or, in the event service has been discontinued prior to such billing, remitted by check or warrant to the customer. (Ord. 1607 § 1 (part), 1987).


13.03.050 Factors considered.

In determining whether or not to grant the adjustment request, in whole or in part, the city manager should consider all reasonably relevant factors including but not limited to appropriate city records, statements of city personnel involved, prospects of city error, unusual and unforeseen circumstances, acts of nature, equipment failure or malfunction, and mail failure. Financial hardship or difficulties of the customer alone shall not constitute sufficient cause for adjustment to the account, unless otherwise required by applicable laws.

A.    A domestic-strength commercial/industrial user shall be defined as any user not falling into the classification of domestic user as defined. These users shall include, but are not limited to, such establishments as schools, churches, hotels, motels, offices, hospitals, businesses, combined business-residences, and industries with primarily domestic-type sanitary wastes.

B.    The same charge formula shall apply to all users within this classification.

C.    The user charge for all domestic-strength commercial/industrial users shall be as listed in CMC 15.10.350. This charge shall be based on monthly water meter readings. A minimum user charge equal to the single-family residential charge shall be levied if the charge calculated from water consumption would otherwise be less.

D.    No discount will be applied for water not returning to sanitary sewer facilities. A sprinkling meter may be utilized by commercial/industrial users for irrigation purposes only; no sewer billing will be levied on this commercial/industrial water use. (Ord. 2225 § 1, 2008: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.070 High-strength commercial/ industrial users—User charges.

A.    The high-strength user charge, as set forth in CMC 15.10.350, shall apply to those users discharging wastewater or wastes with BOD’s and/or suspended solids greater than three hundred mg/l, in quantities exceeding fifty pounds per day, and/or fats, oil and grease (FOG) greater than one hundred mg/l or greater than twenty-four mg/l TKN.

B.    The charge will be based on periodic monitoring of the wastewater entering the public sewer through the side sewer or by reported average values of typical wastewater strengths for that category of discharger. Users will administer these tests through a qualified person and use state certified testing labs at user’s expense.

C.    It shall be the responsibility of each sewer user whose wastewater strength exceeds that stipulated in subsection (A) of this section to notify the administrative authority that the discharge may be subject to high-strength surcharge. Those users who discharge higher strength wastes without approval from the administrative authority are subject to the penalties outlined in CMC 15.10.340.

D.    If the city’s evaluation establishes that a particular user falls within the high-strength industrial/commercial user class, that user may file a written appeal with the administrative authority within thirty days after notification of the classification. Such appeal shall set forth in reasonable detail the source of error being appealed and the appellant’s grounds for modification thereof. If the city’s analysis determines there is no basis for modification, the decision of the administrative authority shall be final.

E.    All high-strength dischargers shall be subject to the terms of the industrial pretreatment program set out in CMC 15.10.270, 15.10.280 and 15.10.290. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.080 Collection of user charge—Delinquency—Penalties—Shutoff.

A.    The following schedule for sewer user charge reductions shall be used for those domestic users who initiate or terminate sewer service between billing intervals. Charges computed for a actual water usage shall not be reduced.

	PERCENTAGE OF NORMAL CHARGE

	Service Interval After Last Bill or Before First Bill

	 	0—7 Days	8—14 Days	15—22 Days	23—30 Days	31—45 Days	46—60 Days

	Monthly	25	50	75	100	—	—

B.    Commercial/industrial users who initiate or terminate sewer service between billing periods shall be required to pay user charges only on the basis of water use. The minimum charge shall not apply to commercial/industrial customers in the case of a partial period of less than one month.

C.    Sewer users who desire to terminate service shall notify the finance department at city hall before the date of such termination. The notification shall include a forwarding address to which the final billing will be sent. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.090 Implementation of user charge system.

A.    The city finance department shall keep and maintain the following records for purposes of evaluation and/or updating the user charge system:

1.    Expenditures for operation and maintenance of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities;

2.    Expenditures attributable to the administration of the wastewater treatment facilities;

3.    Expenditures for the repayment of principal and interest on all outstanding revenue bonds and loans;

4.    Moneys placed in the equipment rental replacement fund, interest accrued, and withdrawals from the fund;

5.    Records of payments from individual users;

6.    Records of water consumption from individual users;

7.    A record of population equivalent user factor for the classifications of domestic users and each new commercial/industrial user;

8.    A record of the total number of domestic and commercial/industrial users by category within the Centralia urban area;

9.    Records of total user charge revenue and total revenues received from each user classification;

B.    The user charge program shall be reviewed annually to ensure continued equitability and generation of sufficient revenue to ensure self-sufficient operation and maintenance of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities. User charges shall be adjusted by action of the city council if such review reveals a deficiency in the rate structure. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.100 Use of public sewers required.

A.    It is unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner upon public or private property within the corporate city limits of Centralia any human excrement, garbage, or other objectionable waste.

B.    The owners of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, situated within the city and abutting on any street, alley, easement, or right-of-way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the city, are required at their expense to install suitable sanitary plumbing fixtures therein and to connect such facilities correctly to the sanitary sewer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within sixty days after the date of receipt of a notice in writing issued by the administrative authority for connection to be made, providing that the public sewer is within two hundred feet of the building, and the connection is approved by the administrative authority. 

Such notice will also be given when the owner is required to repair or completely replace the side sewer, such as during, but not limited to, a sewer rehabilitation project.

When properties with existing dwellings are required to hook up to the sewer due to the extension of new sewer lines the administrative authority is authorized to negotiate a payment schedule for payment of capital facilities charges levied under CMC 15.10.350. Special benefit fees and latecomer fees must be paid when the permit for the connection is issued.

C.    If any such connection, repair or replacement shall not have been made within the time provided, the administrative authority is authorized and directed, at its discretion, to either:

1.    Cause such connection to be made, in which case the administrative authority shall file a statement of the cost thereof with the finance director and thereupon a warrant shall be issued under the direction of the city council by the city finance director and against the wastewater utility fund, created by city of Centralia Ordinance No. 1600 passed on December 30, 1986, for the payment of such costs. Such amount, together with applicable interest, in accordance with state law, shall be assessed against the property upon which the building or structure is situated and shall become a lien thereon. Such lien may be enforced by termination of some or all of the utility services provided to the property or in any other manner authorized by law. Such total amount, when collected, shall be paid into the wastewater utility fund; or

2.    Cause water service to the property to be terminated, if service is provided by the Centralia water utility. Notice to the owner and occupant shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, with a copy to the Lewis County environmental health department. Action will be taken thirty days after receipt of notice in the event of failure of other alternatives or high pollution potential. Final decision on the alternative action to be selected by the administrative authority shall be based upon such factors as location of the unconnected building or structure, effectiveness of existing private treatment facilities, if present, and groundwater contamination potential. (Ord. 2179 § 1, 2006: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.110 Side sewers and connections.

A.    All costs and expenses related to the installation and connection, operation and maintenance, and replacement of the side sewer, including backflow devices, where required, shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the side sewer.

B.    A separate and independent side sewer shall be provided for every building. If one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot under the same ownership and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, yard, or driveway, the side sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer, with prior approval of the administrative authority. If the administrative authority finds that it may be necessary or beneficial to allow two adjacent buildings to connect to the public sewer through a common side sewer, such side sewer shall have a diameter of six inches or greater. When such connection is made under one owner, then later sold to multiple owners, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner(s) to provide proof of the recorded easement to the wastewater utility. Penalty for noncompliance after certified mail notice to the owner giving sixty days to remedy the situation may include termination of city water service to any or all involved buildings.

C.    Old side sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only after they are found, on examination by the administrative authority, to meet all requirements of this chapter.

D.    Any building required to connect to a public sewer shall also disconnect from existing cesspool(s) or septic tank(s). Procedures for abandoning cesspools and septic tanks shall be in accordance with the regulations and standards enforced by the Lewis County environmental health department. Failure to properly abandon may result in the termination of water and sewer service, at the discretion of the administrative authority and on the advice of the Lewis County environmental health department.

E.    Any residential, commercial or industrial user requesting connection with the public sewer, shall first install or have installed an approved water meter, if such meter is not already installed. If the user obtains or can obtain water from sources other than the municipal supply, the meter shall measure the incoming flow from all such sources, and the installation and maintenance of the meter shall be at the user’s expense. In circumstances where the wastewater flow is not generated through a metered water supply, the wastewater discharge must be metered directly. The meter shall be installed and maintained at the property owner’s expense. Such a meter must be located to allow easy accessibility to city staff. Such direct readings will be increased by twenty percent for billing purposes to gain equivalency with other user’s billing basis of nonreturning flow. If either type of meter is found to be defective or otherwise inoperative, usage shall be estimated by the city to be at the highest monthly level recorded for the preceding twelve months. Such meter shall be repaired within sixty days of notification from the administrative authority. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.120 Damage to sanitary sewer system.

In the event of damage caused by a person, firm or corporation to the city’s sewer system, the city reserves the right to reject same and then charge such responsible party the cost of labor, materials, equipment and overhead, which billing, if unpaid sixty days thereafter, shall be turned over to a collection agency as designated by the city, thereto including, but not limited to, lien and discontinuance of service. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.130 Permit requirements.

A.    No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof, or engage in the construction of a side sewer, either on private property or within public rights-of-way, without first obtaining a written side sewer permit from the city community development department. In the event such sewer service is outside the city, the applicant by applying therefore and accepting such service shall be deemed bound by the current and future ordinances of the city affecting such sewer service.

B.    A side sewer permit will be required for each individual structure to be connected and for the collection system of a multiple dwelling or multiple commercial installation.

C.    Application for a side sewer permit will be made by a registered, bonded, insured side sewer contractor or the owner of the property to be served, in accordance with CMC 15.10.230.

D.    No side sewer contractor shall do any side sewer work under any other person’s permit nor shall any unauthorized person do any side sewer work under a side sewer contractor’s permit, except as may be otherwise authorized by the administrative authority.

E.    When a side sewer is to be installed across the private property of another person, the applicant for the side sewer must first provide proof that a duly executed easement has been obtained from other such property owner and officially recorded. A copy shall be provided by the applicant for the wastewater utility records.

F.    When work or excavation is performed within the public right-of-way, a right-of-way permit is required. This permit shall be obtained for the work prior to issuance of a side sewer permit by the city.

G.    The issuance of a side sewer permit by the city shall not relieve the permit holder from the responsibility of obtaining other such permits or licenses as may be required by the city, the county, or other jurisdictions in which the side sewer is installed. Permit holders shall contact other utilities for location of their facilities before starting excavation through the underground utilities locating service toll-free number (1-800-424-5555).

H.    Before a permit shall be issued for the construction of any side sewer to serve any commercial or industrial users, as defined in CMC 15.10.060(A) or 15.10.070(A), the applicant shall first supply proof that an approved water meter has been installed, or will be installed, during the process of constructing the side sewer, in accordance with CMC 15.10.110(E). Alternatively, a direct flow measuring device, in accordance with CMC 15.10.110(E) will be required.

I.    The side sewer permit shall expire one hundred eighty days after the date of issuance. Upon expiration, the applicant must re-apply and pay for a new side sewer permit and all other applicable fees. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.140 Permit application and fees.

A.    There shall be nine classes of side sewer permits/fees: (1) for single-family residential service; (2) for multiple-family residential service; (3) for service to establishments producing commercial or industrial wastes; (4) for alteration or abandonment of an existing side sewer; (5) for infiltration and inflow (I&I) rehabilitation permits; (6) for residential grinder pump connection; (7) for commercial and industrial grinder pump connection; (8) for after hours or holiday inspection fee; and (9) for re-inspection fee.

C.    Demolished or Removed Buildings. The property owner or their contractor engaged in demolishing or removing any structure connected to the public sewer shall notify the city of such work, obtain an abandonment permit from the community development department, and shall expose and plug the side sewer connection of such structure at the property line in accordance with the requirements found in the city of Centralia’s design and development guidelines. A city inspector must observe and document all abandonments. Obtaining an abandonment permit does not relinquish the right to a future connection. 

D.    Permit fees shall be paid to the community development department, with such amount credited to the wastewater utility, which conducts such inspections.

E.    Reference codes adopted by the city include the most current Washington State Uniform Plumbing Code and the most current DOE manual “Criteria for Sewage Works Design.” Specifications included in this chapter shall prevail when in conflict with, or where not addressed by, the aforementioned codes. In unclear circumstances, interpretation will be made by the administrative authority. (Ord. 2298 § 3, 2013: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.145 Term of permit.

A.    Work authorized by permit shall be completed within one hundred eighty days from date of approval by the city, unless extended by the building official. If a building permit is also required, fees shall be collected and both permits shall be obtained simultaneously. If work is not completed within one hundred eighty days or work is suspended or abandoned during the one hundred eighty day period, the permit shall expire and become null and void. Projects where the permit has been deemed null and void shall require the issuance of a new permit accompanied by the required fees and plan reviews.

B.    In the event that permit becomes null and void, the following shall not be refunded:

1.    Sewer connection permit fees;

2.    Latecomer fees;

3.    Five percent capital facility fees. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.150 Pipe material.

A.    Pipes acceptable for gravity side sewers shall be as follows:

1.    Ductile iron: ANSI A 21.51, thickness class 51;

2.    Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): ASTM D3034 with SDR equals 35.

B.    The water and wastewater utilities director, wastewater manager, lead collections technician and city engineer, as a committee of four shall consider any proposed sewer pipe other than those specifically set forth in subsection (A) of this section to determine its acceptability for use.

C.    Whenever possible, side sewers should be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should local conditions prevent a lateral separation of ten feet, a sewer may be laid closer than ten feet to a water main if the sewer is constructed of ductile iron or C-900 PVC pipe with watertight joints, and:

1.    It is laid in a separate trench;

2.    It is laid in the same trench with the water mains located at one side on a bench of undisturbed earth;

3.    In either case the elevation of the crown of the sewer shall be at least eighteen inches below the invert of the water main. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.160 Joints.

A.    All joints and connections shall be gastight and watertight, as determined by the testing and inspections procedures outlined in this chapter.

B.    Joints for PVC pipe shall be rubber-gasketed type conforming to ASTM D3212.

C.    Joint for ductile-iron pipe shall be push-on type or mechanical joint conforming to ANSI A21.11.

D.    Pipe and joints shall be installed in accordance with the instructions furnished by the pipe manufacturer and approved by the administrative authority.

E.    No glued joints will be accepted.

F.    Other joining materials and methods may be used only with the approval of the administrative authority. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.170 Fittings and cleanout.

A.    The side sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight horizontal alignment. Changes in horizontal alignment shall be made only with bends, wye branches, or a combination of a wye branch and bend.

B.    All change of horizontal alignment forty-five degrees or greater shall be made with a wye branch and bends as required, with the straight through opening capped for use as a cleanout. Where a ninety degree bend is required, two forty-five degree bends will be installed to complete the bend. No ninety degree fittings shall be allowed.

C.    A cleanout shall be installed thirty-six inches from all buildings unless permission to change the location of such cleanout has been obtained from the administrative authority. Additional cleanouts, including those used for commercial properties, shall be installed in locations designated by the administrative authority but in no case shall the distance between cleanouts exceed one hundred feet.

D.    Suitable frames and covers of a type designated by the administrative authority shall be used for all cleanouts on commercial property and in paved areas, and such frames shall be cast in a concrete block thirty inches high by thirty inches wide by eight inches deep flush with the final paving.

E.    All cleanouts not in paved areas shall extend to within eighteen inches of the ground surface. All cleanouts shall be capped with appropriate plugs, using the standard compression joint of the pipe being used, to prevent entry of dirt, roots, or groundwater and shall be secured against back pressure.

F.    A test tee shall be provided at the private property and right-of-way boundary and at any other required point or points, as determined by the administrative authority, to ensure that all portions of the side sewer can be tested.

G.    It shall be the responsibility of the permit holder to install all risers, cleanouts, castings, concrete blocks, etc., required before the side sewer will be approved by the city.

H.    Backwater Valves. The Uniform Plumbing Code requires backwater valves on building sewers where a finished floor is below the rim of the upstream manhole. Backwater valves, if they are installed, must be located within the building footprint upstream of the cleanout. The city is not responsible for their installation, maintenance, or operation. (Ord. 2298 § 4, 2013: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.180 Connections to public sewer.

A.    The connection of the side sewer shall be made at a wye or tee.

B.    Connections at other than an existing wye or tee shall be made only by city personnel or a licensed side sewer contractor with the cost borne by the permit holder. Any work done by city personnel shall be billed for actual costs plus overhead. Terms in CMC 15.10.120 shall apply.

C.    If the joint type or dimensions of the wye or tee in the public sewer are different from that of the side sewer pipe, a transition adaptor approved by the administrative authority shall be used to connect the side sewer to the wye or tee. If a suitable transition is not obtainable, the method of making the connection shall be approved by the administrative authority.

D.    Connection to the building drain pipe shall be made by means of flexible clamp-type coupling or by other approved method.

E.    No connections from gutters, roof drains, down spouts, surface drains or yard drains shall be allowed to the sanitary sewer system.

F.    The portion of the building (side) sewer located on the customer’s property is owned by the property owner and it shall be their responsibility to keep the sewer in good working order and free from ground water or surface runoff water.

G.    Repair to a side sewer shall be made within thirty days from receipt of notice to the owner of the property. In the event of an emergency, the city may establish a shorter period of time for the repair to be made or, if the owner cannot be located or does not promptly make such repairs, the city may make the repairs and bill the owners under the procedure of CMC 15.10.100(C)(1).

H.    Alternative Systems. In the event that gravity sewer service is not feasible, as determined by the administrative authority, alternative sewer systems may be permitted. Any alternative sewer system (grinder pumps, vacuum sewers) must be installed at the developer or property owner’s expense in accordance with the city’s design and development guidelines and the current DOE manual “Criteria for Sewage Works Design.” A service agreement provided by the city of Centralia will be signed and notarized stating that all maintenance and inspections shall be the responsibility of the system owner. System owners shall provide a property easement for city staff to access the installation for inspection purposes. Upon completion of installation, successful startup, and acceptance by the city, it shall be the owner’s responsibility to contract with a qualified contractor to work on such systems and to contact the city if work is performed on the grinder pump system. All alternative systems will be equipped with pigging ports for cleaning of the force mains, where appropriate and as determined by the administrative authority.

1.    The following maintenance is required:

a.    Commercial grinder facilities must have their grinder systems integrity verified by a qualified technician on an annual basis. The frequency of the annual inspection may be increased if the system has a history of nonperformance and unreliability.

b.    Residential systems must have their grinder systems integrity verified by a qualified technician every three years. The frequency of the three-year inspection may be increased if the system has a history of nonperformance and unreliability.

c.    All inspection/maintenance records and repairs shall be e-mailed or mailed to the city of Centralia wastewater department for record keeping purposes. 

d.    The owner shall provide the city of Centralia a copy of the manufacturer’s operation and maintenance manual to be kept on record for the life of the system as required by the Washington State Department of Ecology. 

e.    All alterations to the system will be strictly monitored by the city of Centralia.

I.    Sewer connections will not be allowed outside of the city’s UGA boundary unless the applicant provides a certificate from Lewis County allowing the connection because of an immediate health or safety problem that cannot otherwise be resolved. (Ord. 2298 § 5, 2013: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.190 Size and slope of side sewer pipe.

A.    The side sewer pipe shall be six inches in diameter from the public sewer main to the property line. From the property line to the building, the side sewer shall be no less than four inches in diameter. If more than one occupied building is attached to the same building sewer as allowed in CMC 15.10.110(B), the diameter of the side sewer shall not be less than six inches from the building to the points of junction of the sewer lines. Side sewers to multiple structures, commercial establishments, or industrial buildings shall not be less than six inches in diameter.

B.    All side sewers shall be laid on a uniform slope of not less than one-fourth inch per foot, wherever possible. Where it is impossible to obtain a one-fourth inch per foot slope due to the depth of the public sewer or to the structural features arrangements of the building, a slope of not less than one-eighth inch per foot is permissible, when approved by the administrative authority. Reduced slopes will require an increase in pipe size.

C.    In any building, structure, or premises in which the elevation of plumbing fixtures is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, service may be provided by approved ejectors, pumps, or other equally efficient, approved mechanical devices approved by the administrative authority. When only the lower floor of a structure is too low for gravity flow, the remaining floors must flow by gravity.

D.    The discharge line from the ejectors, pumps, or other mechanical devices shall be provided with an accessible backflow valve and gate valve. The discharge line shall connect to the gravity side sewer at the crown of the side sewer through a wye fitting. All such installations shall conform with the current requirements set forth by DOE in “Criteria for Sewage Works Design,” Section C1-10.

E.    When the administrative authority determines there is a possibility of backup in the side sewer from head pressure in the public sewer, flow from any building drain lower than the gravity sewer shall be raised by approved means, or, if determined necessary by the administrative authority for protection against flooding or surcharge, a backflow valve shall be installed and maintained at the owner’s expense.

F.    Effective operation of any backflow valve shall be the responsibility of the owner of the building sewer. The city shall be saved harmless from any damage or injury sustained from installation or operation of said backflow valve.

G.    All pump installations must meet all pertinent building and plumbing codes, current city development standards, and the most current DOE manual “Criteria for Sewage Works Design,” and must be approved by the administrative authority before installation. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.200 Excavation and laying of pipe.

A.    All excavation required for the installation of a side sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the administrative authority.

B.    The side sewer permit holder, before beginning excavation in the public right-of-way area, shall have at the site sufficient barricades to properly protect the work. The barricades shall meet the requirements as listed in the current “Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.”

C.    The side sewer permit holder shall comply with any additional city, county, state, or other jurisdictional laws, ordinances, and regulations relating to the safety and protection of the excavation, and proper work practices when asbestos-containing pipe is involved.

D.    When unsuitable bedding, such as rock, is found, as determined by the administrative authority, the side sewer trench shall be over-excavated and a bedding of sand or fine gravel a minimum of four inches deep shall be prepared. Gravel shall be three-quarter inch maximum in size. If the trench is unintentionally over-excavated, the bottom shall be brought to proper grade using this same bedding material.

E.    All pipe shall be laid true to grade with the bell upstream. Pipe shall be cradled in the prepared trench bottom. The bottom of the trench shall be smooth and free from large rocks that could damage the side sewer pipe. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.210 Testing and inspection.

A.    It shall be the duty of the person installing the side sewer as authorized by the permit to notify the utilities department orally or in writing that the sewer is ready for inspection. Twenty-four hours may be required after the notification before the actual inspection. Inspections can be made on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays, provided the inspection is scheduled forty-eight hours in advance and the contractor or owner agrees to pay an additional one hundred dollar inspection fee prior to inspection (CMC 15.10.140(B)).

B.    Side sewers shall be tested for their entire length from the public sewer by testing for visible leakage before backfilling by inserting a removable plumber’s plug at the connection of the side sewer to the public sewer and filling to a line with water to a level of at least one foot above the top of the side sewer at its connection with the building drain. A test tee or tees as required in CMC 15.10.170(F) shall be used for insertion of the plug and shall be secured against backpressure upon completion of the test. A special fitting, provided by the permit holder, shall be inserted into the cleanout fitting at the connection to the building drain to provide a short standpipe to obtain a one-foot head pressure at that point. The side sewer permit holder or a licensed side sewer contractor must be present at the job during the full duration of the inspection.

C.    Products used to seal the inside of the pipe (such as grout, etc.) are not to be used to obtain a passing test.

D.    It shall be the duty of the holder of a permit to make sure that the work will pass inspection by performing the test described in subsection (B) of this section before giving notification for inspection. If an additional inspection is necessary due to test failure and/or improper installation, a charge of fifty dollars shall be made for each additional inspection.

E.    Notices of corrections or violations shall be written by the administrative authority and may be posted at the site of the work or mailed or delivered to the permittee or his authorized representative. Refusal, failure, or neglect to comply with any such notice or order within ten days after receipt thereof shall be considered a violation of this code and shall be subject to the penalties for violations set forth elsewhere in this code.

F.    Upon satisfactory completion of the leakage test and inspection, a certificate of approval shall be issued by the administrative authority on demand. (Ord. 2298 § 6, 2013: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.220 Backfilling.

A.    Trenches shall be backfilled within forty-eight hours after successful completion of inspection. Backfilling of trenches and restoration of roadway surfacing of any thoroughfare or right-of-way, public or private, shall be the responsibility of the permit holder.

B.    No backfill shall be placed over pipe until the work has been inspected and approved by the administrative authority. Any portion of the side sewer covered before inspection shall be uncovered at the owner’s expense within two days after notice to do so has been issued by the administrative authority. Re-inspection of the site will cause the owner/contractor to be subject to a fifty-dollar re-inspection fee.

C.    Trenches shall be carefully backfilled by tamping to a depth of six inches above the pipe to avoid damaging the pipe. All backfill between the public sewer and the property line shall be water-settled or mechanically tamped in six-inch layers to minimize settlement. Any settlement that occurs within twenty-four months after backfilling shall be corrected at the expense of the permit holder. Additional fill and surfacing materials as approved by the city engineer shall be placed to restore the settled area to original grade.

D.    A minimum of six inches of gravel surfacing shall be temporarily placed in the public right-of-way or be temporarily placed in the public right-of-way or traveled areas in commercial properties. Final surfacing equivalent to the adjoining undisturbed roadway shall not be placed until such time as, in the opinion of the city engineer, final settlement has taken place.

E.    All pipe installations shall be bedded and backfilled to conform to the pipe manufacturer’s specifications.

F.    Minimum cover for side sewers shall be eighteen inches, except as hereafter provided:

G.    Where it is necessary for water and sewer lines to cross each other, the crossing shall be at an angle of approximately ninety degrees and the sewer shall be located eighteen inches or more below the waterline. The administrative authority may require that the sewer be constructed of ductile iron for a distance of at least ten feet on each side of the water main, and/or be placed inside of a protective casing.

H.    Failure to call for an inspection will be cause for termination of water service thirty days after receipt of notification. The administrative authority will send such notification by certified mail, return receipt requested. A copy shall be mailed to the Lewis County environmental health department. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.230 Side sewer contractor.

A.    No person shall hereinafter engage in the business of installing building sewers or in connecting building sewers to any public sewer of the city of Centralia unless such person is registered, bonded and insured as required by the laws of the state of Washington; provided, however, and excepting from the above requirement, the bona fide property owner or direct family member, which would mean spouse, parents or children, may construct the building sewer provided they abide by all requirements of this chapter. For purposes of this chapter, the digging of the ditch in which to lay the sewer shall not of itself be construed as installation of a building sewer.

B.    If a side sewer contractor’s work is determined by the administrative authority to be unacceptable, further sewer permits may be denied for the following causes: failure to observe the rules and regulations issued by the administrative authority, or other codes referenced in this chapter, governing the construction and laying of side sewers; fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining licensing, bonding and/or insurance; failure to pay for labor or material used in the construction of a side sewer; fraud or misrepresentation to the owner, agent, or occupant of a building for the purpose of obtaining a contract for the construction of a side sewer; or for nonpayment for work performed by the wastewater utility for the payment of which a side sewer contractor may be liable. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.240 Latecomer reimbursement.

A. The owner of the property must pay all applicable fees, including but not limited to any latecomer charges. All connections must be made in accordance with the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that there shall be no new connections to an existing sewer system unless it is first determined by the administrative authority that such existing sewer system can adequately handle the additional sewage caused by such new connection or connections. 

B. A developer who enters into a latecomer reimbursement agreement with the city must initiate the process within ninety days of final acceptance of the sewer project. (Ord. 2179 § 2, 2006: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.250 Septage dumping.

It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to deposit, dump, place, or leave septage, sewage, or effluent from any septic tank, cesspool, or other private or city of Centralia sewage disposal system within the corporate limits of the city of Centralia. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.260 Prohibited discharge standards.

A.    General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. (40 CFR 403.5(a) and WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(i)).

B.    Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants in any form (solid, liquid, or gaseous):

9.    Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair (WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(ii));

10.    Any of the following discharges unless approved by the administrative authority under extraordinary circumstances such as the lack of direct discharge alternatives due to combined sewer service or need to augment sewage flows due to septic conditions (WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(vii)):

a.    Noncontact cooling water in significant volumes,

b.    Stormwater, and other direct inflow sources, or

c.    Wastewaters significantly affecting system hydraulic loading, which do not require treatment or would not be afforded a significant degree of treatment by the POTW;

11.    Any dangerous or hazardous wastes as defined in Chapter 173-303 WAC, as amended, except as allowed in compliance with that regulation (WAC 173-216-060(1) and 40 CFR Part 261);

12.    Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES, state waste discharge or other disposal system permits or causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant’s effluent to fail a toxicity test;

13.    Any substance which may cause the POTW’s effluent or treatment residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or would interfere with the reclamation process or cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed pursuant to the federal, state, or local statues or regulations applicable to the sludge management method being used;

14.    Any discharge which imparts color which cannot be removed by the POTW’s treatment process such as dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently impart color to the treatment plant’s effluent, thereby violating the city’s NPDES permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the compensation point for photosynthesis activity in the receiving waters by more than ten percent from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life;

15.    Any discharge containing radioactive wastes or isotopes except as specifically approved by the administrative authority in compliance with applicable rate or federal regulations including WAC 246-221-190 “Disposal By Release Into Sanitary Sewerage Systems”; and meeting the concentration limits of WAC 246-221-290, Appendix A, Table I, Column 2; and WAC 246-221-300, Appendix B;

16.    Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes or from industrial processes;

17.    Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the administrative authority;

20.    Persistent pesticides and/or pesticides regulated by the Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA);

21.    Any wastewater, which in the opinion of the administrative authority can cause harm either to the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance, unless allowed under a legal and binding agreement by the administrative authority (except that no waiver may be given to any categorical pretreatment standard).

C.    Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW.

D.    Every building, structure, or premise used or occupied by any sewer user where any commercial or industrial operations are conducted or permitted which result in the discharge into the sewer system of any products, waste products, or other substances, matter, or liquid in the manner and to the extent prohibited in this section shall be equipped with an adequate and suitable grease trap, filter, or other interception device installed in such a manner that the product, waste products, or other substances, materials, or liquid herein set forth will not flow into or be discharged into the sanitary sewer system. The grease trap, filter, or other interceptor shall be adequately maintained, readily accessible for inspection by the administrative authority at any time to ensure its proper operation, and is subject to the terms in CMC 15.10.280.

E.    The owner of any vehicle-washing facility shall install and maintain in a proper manner and at his own expense an approved sediment and oil trap located in the side sewer line. Records of proper cleaning and maintenance must be kept and made available to city inspectors. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.270 Commercial/industrial waste discharges.

A.    The administrative authority may allow discharge of commercial/industrial waste not prohibited by CMC 15.10.260 into the public sewer. The decision on whether or not to allow any such discharge will be made on a case-by-case basis once the characteristics of the proposed waste discharge have been fully disclosed and will result in an individual agreement.

B.    In instances where the discharge of commercial/industrial waste into the public sewer is proposed, the administrative authority may:

1.    Prohibit discharge into the public sewer; and/or

2.    Require preliminary treatment (“pretreatment”) to acceptable condition for discharge into the public sewer; and/or

3.    Require payment of an additional charge and fee as provided in CMC 15.10.350 for the added cost and expense of treating such waters or wastes so admitted into the sewage system; and/or

4.    Require monitoring of the discharge as provided in CMC 15.10.070; and/or

5.    Require user to obtain a state discharge permit.

C.    In cases where pretreatment is required, plans, specifications, and other information relating to the construction and installation of pretreatment facilities shall be submitted by the industry to the Ecology and the administrative authority for approval. No construction or installation thereof shall commence until written approval has been received from the administrative authority and Ecology. Such pretreatment facilities shall be constructed, operated, and maintained at the owner’s expense. The industry shall comply with the Ecology and the EPA pretreatment regulations and the state waste discharge permit program.

D.    Any person constructing a pretreatment facility, as required by the administrative authority or Ecology, shall also install and maintain at the facility owner’s sole expense a sampling and metering manhole for monitoring the discharge to the public sewer. Such sampling and metering manhole shall be placed in a location approved by the administrative authority and in accordance with approved specifications.

E.    The city can require written permits and/or operating plans for any commercial or industrial discharger that does not fall under state and federal permit requirements. Noncompliance with the permit requirements are enforceable under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2148 § 3, 2005: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.280 Pretreatment of fats, oils and grease required.

A.    Dischargers who operate newly constructed multiplex units or apartment complexes, restaurants, cafes, lunch counters, cafeterias, bars, or clubs; or hotels, hospitals, sanitariums, factories, churches or school kitchens; or other establishments that serve or prepare food where grease may be introduced to the sewer system shall have pretreatment facilities to prevent the discharge of fat waste, oil, or grease (FOG). Take-out food establishments or other establishments that prepare food, but do not cook in oil or grease, and who serve food only in disposable containers, may be exempted from this requirement, provided their discharges do not violate the general discharge prohibitions of this chapter. These pretreatment facilities must have grease interceptors installed in the waste line leading from sinks, drains, or other fixtures where grease may be discharged. The grease interceptors must meet, at a minimum, the specifications of the current Uniform Plumbing Code adopted by the city. The administrative authority is authorized to adopt and publish additional criteria for grease interceptors. Dischargers must maintain these facilities in a manner that will always prevent fat waste, oil, or grease from being carried into the sewer system. Fat waste, oil, or grease removed from such a facility shall not be disposed of in sanitary or storm sewers.

B.    All existing restaurants, cafes, lunch counters, cafeterias, bars, or clubs, or hotels, hospitals, sanitariums, factories, churches or school kitchens or other establishments that serve or prepare food where grease may be introduced to the sewer system which do not have a grease interceptor at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall meet the requirements for grease, oil and fats by installing a grease interceptor within one year of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Failure to install a grease interceptor within one year shall result in penalties as outlined in CMC 15.10.340. All grease removal systems must be approved by the administrative authority prior to installation.

C.    Use of Enzymes within the City of Centralia POTW. Introduction of any additives into a food service establishment’s wastewater system for the purpose of emulsifying FOG is prohibited, unless a specific written authorization from the FOG control program manager is obtained. (Ord. 2298 § 7, 2013: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.290 Washing facilities, grease rack—Pretreatment.

Dischargers who operate automatic and coin-operated laundries, car washes, filling stations, commercial garages or similar businesses having any type of washing facilities or grease racks and any other dischargers producing grit, sand, oils, or other materials which have the potential of causing partial or complete obstruction of the building sewer or other areas in the sewer system shall install approved interceptors or tanks in accordance with the latest specifications adopted by the city such that excessive amounts of oil, sand and inert solids are effectively prevented from entering the city sewer. Effective April 1, 2000, all new car washes shall be closed loop, no discharge systems. Proof of required operation and maintenance records must be made available for city inspectors. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.300 Inspection fees.

All grease interceptors, oil/water separators, settling tanks and grit traps shall be installed, maintained and operated by the discharger at his own expense. The installation shall be kept in continuous operation at all times, and shall be maintained to provide efficient operation. Cleaning must be performed by a service contractor qualified to perform such cleaning. All material removed shall be disposed of in accordance with all state and federal regulations. Certification of maintenance shall be made readily available to city authorized personnel for review and inspection. Inspection and cleaning frequency of grease interceptors/traps is at the sole discretion of the administrative authority. If a failure to maintain settling tanks, grit traps, grease interceptors, or oil/water separators results in partial or complete blockage of the building sewer or other parts of the wastewater utility system, or adversely affects the treatment or transmission capabilities of the system, or requires excessive maintenance by the city, the discharger responsible for the facilities shall be subject to the remedies, including enforcement and penalties detailed in this chapter. Regular inspections will be conducted at no charge to the customer; however, re-inspections for systems not properly maintained will be charged a fifty-dollar re-inspection fee. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.310 Right of revision.

The city reserves the right to amend this chapter, and any permits issued under it, to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater utility system if such amendments are deemed necessary to comply with the prohibitions set forth in CMC 15.10.260, or are otherwise in the public interest. No vested right shall be created by the issuance of any permit under this chapter. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.320 Entry of private property.

The administrative authority, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter upon all and any premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing of sewers and sewage, and performance of all other acts or duties required within the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.330 Violations.

A.    Definition. For the purposes of enforcement, the provisions of the rules establishing what constitutes a violation for general dischargers are set forth in this chapter. Those dischargers subject to national pretreatment standards will be subject to enforcement action in accordance with this chapter for any violations of the criteria and limitations specified in the categorical standard or the general pretreatment standards set forth in 40 CFR 403, same being incorporated herein by this reference.

B.    Sewer Connection Without Permission. It is unlawful to make or cause to be made or to maintain any sewer connection with any sewer of the city of Centralia, or with any sewer which is connected directly or indirectly with any sewer of the city of Centralia without having permission from the administrative authority. In the event permission has not been granted by the city of Centralia, the city shall seek remedies under CMC 15.10.340(D).

C.    Maximum Daily Concentration Allowed. The maximum daily allowable concentration for dischargers not regulated under national pretreatment standards is violated under the following circumstances:

1.    The arithmetic mean of concentrations for eight consecutive samples collected within a twenty-four hour time period over intervals of fifteen minutes or greater is in excess of the limitation.

2.    The concentration value obtained from composite sample that is representative of the twenty-four hour discharge is in excess of the limitation.

3.    The concentration of any single sample (whether as single grab sample or a sample within a series) exclusive of any fats, oils, and grease exceeds the limitation by a factor of two and one-half times.

4.    The arithmetic means of the concentration of fats, oils, or greases for three grab samples, taken no more frequently than at five minute intervals exceeds the limitation.

D.    pH Sample. The pH of any given sample is less than pH 6.0 or greater than pH 9.0.

E.    Temperature Limitation. The temperature limitation is exceeded for any single sample.

F.    Maximum Allowable Poundage Limitations. A violation shall occur if the maximum allowable effluent poundage limitation as established in the private wastewater discharge permit is exceeded. The daily poundage discharged shall be calculated using the volume of effluent discharged that day times the concentration for that day either reported by the discharger or obtained through sampling by the city. The poundage shall be determined utilizing the formula:

Lbs/day = conc. in mg/l x gal/day disch x 8.34/1,000,000

G.    Reporting Requirements. A violation shall occur if any reporting requirements established by permit, accidental discharges, upset conditions, written request of the administrative authority, or as specified by general pretreatment standards (40 CFR 403.12) are not complied with. A violation shall occur when any person knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other documents filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter.

H.    FOG Pretreatment Facility—Maintenance. A violation shall occur if there is any failure to maintain grease or grit interceptors or oil/water separators which causes maintenance on any sewer line to be greater than once every two years caused by excessive oil, grease, or fat build up in the sewer lines; or excess build up of sand, gravel or other materials clogging the sewer lines. The lack of any device to prevent discharge of grease, oil, fats, sand, gravel or any other materials which will cause excessive maintenance of the sewer lines shall not relieve the discharger of the responsibility of liability for any costs to the city for excessive maintenance and/or other costs, including overhead incurred by the city.

I.    Discharge of Dangerous Waste. A violation shall occur if any material listed on the discharge chemical products list of the state of Washington (WAC 173-303-9903) is discharged into any public sewer, or building sewer tributary thereto.

J.    Explosion Meter Readings. A violation shall occur if the readings on an explosion meter at any point in the collection system or wastewater treatment plant is greater than ten percent for a single reading or greater than five percent for two successive readings.

K.    Pass Through or Interference. Any discharge which causes pass through or interference with the wastewater treatment plant is a violation.

L.    Emergency Suspension of Service and Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit or Limited Permit.

1.    The city may, without advance notice, order the suspension of all or some portion of the wastewater treatment service and any applicable industrial wastewater discharge permit or limited permit to a discharger when it appears to the city that an actual or potential discharge:

a.    Presents or threatens a substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment; or

b.    Threatens to or interferes with the operation of the wastewater treatment plant or collection system; or

c.    Causes pass through to the environment or treatment process upset.

2.    Any discharger notified of the city’s suspension order shall cease immediately all discharges. In the event of failure of the discharger to comply with the suspension order, the city may commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger’s specific compliance with such order and/or to recover civil penalties. The city shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof by the discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or of the conditions creating the threat as set forth in this section and payment of all penalties and fees.

3.    In addition to all other rights and remedies, the city shall have the authority to immediately discontinue water service to a discharger if the city determines that such action is reasonably necessary to suspend service as authorized by subsection (L)(1) of this section. The city shall have the right of access onto the discharger’s private property to accomplish such termination of the water service.

M.    Termination of Treatment Services—Permit Revocation. Dischargers holding NPDES or state discharge permits will be referred to DOE for violations and enforcement/revocation of their permit. The city shall have the authority to terminate wastewater treatment services and to revoke any locally issued industrial wastewater discharge permit or limited permit of the discharger if it determines that the discharger has:

1.    Failed to accurately report wastewater constituents and characteristics; or

2.    Failed to report significant changes in wastewater constituents, characteristics, flow volumes or types of discharge to the wastewater treatment plant; or

3.    Refused reasonable access to the discharger’s premises for purposes of inspection or monitoring; or

4.    Violated conditions of the wastewater discharge permit; or

5.    Violated any of the provisions of this chapter or regulations promulgated hereunder; or

6.    Violated any lawful order of the city issued with respect to the discharger’s permit or this chapter; or

7.    Tampers with, disrupts, damages or renders inaccurate any wastewater monitoring device required by this chapter.

N.    Other Violations.

1.    If reports required by permit, this chapter or state or federal pretreatment regulations are submitted later than thirty days after they are due, the discharger shall be subject to civil penalties of five hundred dollars per day for a maximum of twenty working days. The penalty shall then be increased to one thousand dollars per day with a maximum fine of twenty thousand dollars. In the event the reports have not been submitted at the time the maximum penalty is imposed, the city shall seek remedies under CMC 15.10.340.

2.    If any of the actions prescribed in any compliance schedule established by permit or by order of the administrative authority are not complete within thirty days of the time they are required to be complete, the discharger shall be subject to civil penalties of five hundred dollars per day for a maximum of sixty days for each day the action(s) have not been completed. In the event the actions have not been completed ninety days after the date scheduled in the permit or order the city shall seek remedies under CMC 15.10.340.

3.    If a discharger fails to maintain grease, oil and/or sediment removal systems which result in excessive maintenance by the city of the collection system or treatment plant, the discharger shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars which shall be added to the costs incurred by the city to perform the maintenance. If excessive maintenance is required a second time within a two year period, the penalty shall be one thousand dollars which shall be added to the costs of maintenance by the city. In the event excessive maintenance continues the city shall seek remedies under CMC 15.10.340.

4.    Failure to provide accurate or complete information on any wastewater discharge reports or the requirements of a discharge permit shall result in a civil penalty of one hundred dollars for the first offense. Thereafter the discharger shall be subject to remedies under subsection (N)(1) of this section.

5.    All commercial and industrial users are required to complete the annual user survey and submit the completed form to the utilities department within forty-five days of receipt. Failure to complete the survey within the required time will subject the user to penalties as outlined in this chapter.

6.    In addition to the assessments described in this section any costs incurred by the city, including attorneys’ fees, due to violations subject to civil penalty shall be added to the total amount of the civil penalty assessment. (Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).


15.10.340 Penalties.

A.    Criminal Sanctions. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to other penalties as are provided herein, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars plus costs and penalty assessments. Each separate day or any portion thereof during which any violation of this chapter occurs shall be deemed to constitute a separate offense, and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable as herein provided.

B.    Civil Liability for Expenses and Fines. Any discharger violating provisions of this chapter shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage caused to the collection system and/or treatment plant by reason of such violation, including increased costs for sewage treatment, sludge treatment and disposal and operation and maintenance expenses when such increased costs are the result of the discharger’s discharge. If the discharger discharges pollutants that cause the city to violate any condition of its NPIDES permit and to be fined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the state or federal government for such violation, the discharger shall be liable to the city for the total amount of the fine assessed against the city, including, without limitation, all legal, sampling, analytical and other associated costs and expenses.

C.    Termination of Service—Lien. In addition to the foregoing criminal sanctions and penalties detailed in other sections and not in any way a limitation thereof, persons alleged to be violating any provision of this chapter may be subject to termination of water and/or sewer service by the city upon being given ten days’ written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to such person’s address as last shown on the city records, informing them of the alleged violation and informing them that failure to correct such violation will result in termination of such service at the end of the ten-day period; provided, however, this section does not apply to termination of service due to nonpayment of the utility billing. Any work accomplished by customer request or necessary for maintenance, operation, and/or sampling of the private sewer, which may be billed for time, materials, equipment and overhead, or to repair damage caused by a customer and so billed, shall be subject to all applicable penalties including, but not limited to, lien and discontinuance of service, as provided for in CMC 15.10.120.

D.    RCW 35.67.350, Penalty for Sewer Connection Without Permission, as now in force or hereafter amended, added to or deleted from, is adopted by reference as part of this chapter. (Ord. 2077 § 1, 2001: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).

For new multiple-family residential accounts, the average winter usage per dwelling unit shall be ninety percent of that calculated from all residential usage.

On January 1st of each year beginning in 2014, the rates shall be adjusted to reflect the annual percentage increase in the United States Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for November of the preceding year as shown in the release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Calculation of the change in the index is made by dividing the current index for November by the preceding index for November and subtracting one.

B.    Capital Facility Charge.

1.    So that the property owners shall bear their equitable share of the cost of the wastewater system and as authorized in RCW 35.92.035, there shall be paid a capital facilities charge at the time the sewer permit is approved for a wastewater connection based on the size of the water meter (see exception in CMC 15.10.100 for certain required connections).

When a request or requirement for a larger size water meter is made, the additional capital facilities charge for wastewater will be the difference between the old water meter size and the new water meter size based on the current schedule of capital facilities charges.

The capital facility charges shall be as follows:

	 	Capital Facilities Charge Effective January 1:

	Water Meter Size	2009	2010	2011	2012	2013

	3/4 inch	$4,932	$5,582	$6,232 	$6,388	$6,548

	8 inch	$263,024	$297,689	$332,354 	$340,663	$349,180

On January 1st of each year beginning in 2012, capital facility charges shall be adjusted to reflect the annual percentage increase of the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index as published for November of the preceding year. Calculation of the change in the index is made by dividing the current index for November by the preceding index for November and subtracting one.

2.    For projects not completed within one hundred eighty days after approval and where the permit has expired in accordance with CMC 15.10.145, the capital facilities charge shall be refunded to the applicant subject to a five percent processing fee. Latecomer, permit and inspection fees are non-refundable. Applicant shall be charged fee rates in effect at time of payment.

3.    All capital facility fees collected shall be classified as restricted funds for capital system additions and improvements. (Ord. 2378 § 1, 2016: Ord. 2298 § 8, 2013: Ord. 2225 § 2, 2008: Ord. 2212 § 9 (part), 2008: Ord. 2199 § 1, 2007: Ord. 2179 § 3, 2006: Ord. 2134 § 1, 2004: Ord. 2069 § 1, 2001: Ord. 2051 § 1 (part), 2000).

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions describe the meaning of the terms used in this chapter:

A.    “City” means the city of Centralia, Washington, a municipality and its authorized employees.

B.    “Closed system” means a portion or type of the storm and surface water system that contains or includes piping, manholes, catch basins and/or other enclosed facilities as part of the collection or transmission facilities.

C.    “Commercial” means any business, multifamily building, church, school building, manufacturing facility or any other non-single-family residential building.

D.    “Commercial on-site system” means either:

1.    “Retention structure” means a permanent structure that provides for the storage of runoff by means of a permanent pool of water or infiltration; or

One ESU is equal to three thousand square feet of impervious surface area.

H.    “Impervious surface” means that hard surface area which either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle and/or causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from that present under natural conditions. Impervious surfaces may include, but are not limited to, rooftops, concrete or asphalt paving, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots or storage areas, and oiled, macadam, graveled, or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration or runoff of surface water.

I.    “Open system” means a portion or type of the storm and surface water system that does not contain or include piping, manholes, catch basins, and/or other enclosed facilities or part of the collection or transmission facilities; and consists entirely of roadside or regional ditches, drainage canals or open channels, other than sections of culverts over driveways, roadways or other facilities that cross the storm drainage systems.

J.    “Parcel” means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries and surface area which is documented for tax purposes and given a tax account number by the Lewis County assessor.

K.    “Single-family residential” means a dwelling unit for occupancy by a single family.

L.    “Runoff” means the portion of precipitation either from rain or melted snow that ultimately reaches natural water courses by flowing over the surface of land.

M.    “Utility” means the storm and surface water utility of the city of Centralia.

N.    “Public works director” means the public works director of the city of Centralia or his/her designee. (Ord. 2350 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 2143 § 1 (part), 2004).

Calculation of the change in the index is made by dividing the current index for November by the preceding index for November and subtracting one. (Ord. 2350 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 2156 § 1, 2005: Ord. 2153 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2143 § 1 (part), 2004).


15.40.040 Storm and surface water account.

A.    If the city receives an application for or initiates a proposal that involves a nonexempt action, the city shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the city is aware that another agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

B.    When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. The city shall not prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

C.    If the city receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within fourteen days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the fourteen-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by the responsible official.

D.    The city is authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any city department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

E.    The city, in making a lead agency determination for a private project, shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).


16.04.053 Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).


16.04.055 Additional considerations in time limits applicable to the SEPA process.

Time estimates contained in this section (expressed in calendar days) shall apply when the city processes licenses for all private projects and those governmental proposals submitted to the city by other agencies. The actual time may vary with the complexity of the project, availability of staff, cooperation of agencies with jurisdiction or expertise, etc. Time periods for making threshold determinations shall commence upon payment of fees.

A.    Categorical Exemptions. The city will normally identify whether an action is categorically exempt within seven days of receiving a completed application.

B.    Threshold Determinations. When the city is lead agency for a proposal, the following threshold determination timing requirements apply:

1.    If a DS is made concurrent with the notice of application, the DS and scoping notice shall be combined with the notice of application (RCW 36.70B.110). Nothing in this subsection prevents the DS/scoping notice from being issued before the notice of application. If sufficient information is not available to make a threshold determination when the notice of application is issued, the DS may be issued later in the review process.

2.    If the city is lead agency and project proponent or is funding a project, the city may conduct its review under SEPA and may allow appeals of procedural determinations prior to submitting a project permit application.

3.    If an open record predecision hearing is required, the threshold determination shall be issued at least fifteen days before the open record predecision hearing (RCW 36.70B.110(6)(b)).

4.    The optional DNS process in WAC 197-11-355 may be used to indicate on the notice of application that the lead agency is likely to issue a DNS. If this optional process is used, a separate comment period on the DNS may not be required (refer to WAC 197-11-355(4)). (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).


16.04.058 Additional timing considerations.

A.    If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications.

B.    In addition to the environmental documents, an applicant shall submit the following information for early environmental review:

1.    Site plan as required by the zoning code.

2.    Other information as the responsible official may determine. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).

Part III. Categorical Exemptions and Threshold Determinations


16.04.065 Purpose of this part and adoption by reference.

This part contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a “probable significant, adverse environmental impact” requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared.

(Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).


16.04.070 Flexible thresholds for categorical exemptions.

A.    Categorical exemptions are adopted by reference under CMC 16.04.180. The city establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under WAC 197-11-800(1)(d) based on local conditions:

1.    For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(d): twenty units.

2.    For agricultural structures in WAC 197-11-800(1)(d): forty thousand square feet.

3.    For office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage buildings in WAC 197-11-800(1)(d): twelve thousand square feet and forty parking spaces.

4.    For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800(1)(d): forty parking spaces.

5.    For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(d): one thousand cubic yards.

16.04.080 Use of exemptions.

A.    Upon receiving an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, initiating the proposal, the city shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The city’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter shall apply to the proposal.

B.    In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the city shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the city shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the city’s consideration is exempt.

C.    If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

1.    The city shall not give authorization for:

a.    Any nonexempt action;

b.    Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or

c.    Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives.

2.    The city may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

3.    The city may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved.

D.    1.    Short subdivision of lands previously subdivided under an exemption from the SEPA rules shall not be exempt from environmental review.

2.    Proposed short subdivision of land that is adjacent to previous short subdivisions or adjacent to land on which a subdivision is pending shall not be exempt if adjacent subdivisions share any improvements or access easements. In such cases, the proposed short plat will be considered physically or functionally related regardless of ownership. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).


16.04.090 Environmental checklist.

A.    A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; provided, that a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency.

B.    For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the applicant shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

C.    The city may require that it or a consultant of the city’s choosing, and not the private applicant, shall complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

1.    The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

2.    The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. Prior to the hiring of such consultant, the applicant, the city and the consultant shall enter into a three-party agreement under which the applicant pays the consultant directly for services rendered. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).


16.04.100 Threshold determination (DNS, mitigated DNS, optional DNS and DS).

A.    As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B.    Early Notice.

1.    An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

a.    Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the city is lead agency; and

b.    Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

2.    The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within fifteen working days. The response shall:

a.    Be written;

b.    State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific areas of concern that are leading the city to consider a DS; and

c.    State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

C.    As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

D.    When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within fifteen days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

1.    If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

2.    If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3.    The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent storm water runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct two-hundred-foot storm water retention pond at Y location” are adequate.

4.    Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

E.    A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a fourteen-day comment period and public notice or issued under the optional DNS process, WAC 197-11-355.

F.    Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city. Failure to comply with the designated mitigation measures shall be grounds for suspension and/or revocation of any issued license or permit.

G.    If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).

H.    Optional DNS Process.

1.    When the responsible official has a reasonable basis for determining significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely for a proposal, the city may use a single integrated comment period to obtain comments on the notice of application and the likely threshold determination for the proposal. If the process is used, an second comment period will typically not be required when the DNS is issued.

2.    If the city uses the optional process, the responsible official shall comply with the requirements of WAC 179-11-355, combining the SEPA notice with the notice of application and providing on fourteen-day comment period for the application and SEPA determination.

I.    The city’s written response under subsection (B) of this section, Early Notice, shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).

The critical area designations shall have full force and effect of law as of the date of filing.

B.    The city shall treat proposals located wholly or partially within a critical area as other nonexempt proposals under this chapter, making a threshold determination for all such proposals. The city shall not automatically require an EIS for a proposal merely because it is proposed for location in a critical area.

C.    Certain exemptions do not apply on lands covered by water, and this remains true regardless of whether or not lands covered by water are mapped. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).


16.04.200 Fees.

The city shall require the following fees for its activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter:

A.    Threshold Determination. For every environmental checklist the city will review when it is lead agency, the city shall collect a fee as established by resolution of the city council from the proponent of the proposal prior to undertaking the threshold determination. The time periods provided by this chapter for making a threshold determination shall not begin to run until payment of the fee. When the city completes the environmental checklist at the applicant’s request or under CMC 16.04.090(C), an additional cost plus a percent as established by resolution of the city council shall be collected.

B.    Environmental Impact Statement.

1.    When the city is the lead agency for a proposal requiring an EIS and the responsible official determines that the EIS shall be prepared by employees of the city, the city will charge and collect a reasonable fee from any applicant to cover costs incurred by the city in preparing the EIS. The responsible official shall advise the applicant(s) of the projected costs for the EIS prior to actual preparation; the applicant shall post bond or otherwise ensure payment of such costs.

2.    The responsible official may determine that the city will contract directly with a consultant of the city’s choice for preparation of an EIS, or a portion of the EIS, for activities initiated by some persons or entity other than the city and may bill such costs and expenses directly to the applicant. The city may require the applicant to post bond or otherwise ensure payment of such costs. Such consultants shall be selected by mutual agreement of the city and applicant.

3.    If a proposal is modified so that an EIS is no longer required, the responsible official shall refund any fees collected under subsection (B)(1) or (2) of this section which remain after incurred costs are paid.

C.    The city will collect a reasonable fee from an applicant to cover the cost of meeting the public notice requirements of this chapter relating to the applicant’s proposal.

D.    The city shall not collect a fee for performing its duties as a consulted agency.

E.    The city will charge any person for copies of any document prepared under this chapter, and for mailing the document, in a manner provided by Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 2304 § 1 (part), 2013).

16.16.010 General authority.

This chapter is adopted under the authority of RCW 36.70A.050. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the use of land in and around critical areas, wildlife habitat, and natural hazard areas lying within the city and its jurisdiction in order to:

A.    Bring the city into compliance with the Washington State Growth Management Act (Chapter 36.70A RCW);

B.    Incorporate appropriate best available science into the regulation of critical areas, resource lands, wildlife habitat, and natural hazard areas (RCW 36.70A.172(1));

C.    Promote the public health, safety and general welfare in accordance with the standards established by the state and the city;

D.    Regulate development on and around critical areas in order to protect lives, property and public infrastructure;

E.    Prevent development which is incompatible with certain critical areas which are particularly susceptible to water quality, noise, and air quality impacts associated with nearby development;

F.    Establish mechanisms to process and review development proposals for consistency with the new regulations which are fair, timely and minimize the impacts on permit processing times;

G.    Protect unique, fragile and valuable elements of the environment including without limitation wildlife and its habitat;

H.    Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and maintain the city of Centralia as an eligible community for federal flood insurance benefits; and

I.    Encourage the retention of open space and development of recreational opportunities, conserve fish and wildlife habitat, and increase access to natural resource lands and water. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.030 Intent.

Critical areas include geologically hazardous areas, fish and wildlife habitat protection areas, wetlands, aquifer and wellhead protection areas and floodplains. The intent of this chapter is to preserve the beneficial functions and values of critical areas, and to minimize potential dangers or public costs associated with the inappropriate use of such areas, and to manage development in or adjacent to critical areas. This chapter contains classification criteria and preservation standards for each type of critical area. Classification criteria identify physical characteristics by which critical areas are designated. Preservation standards protect critical areas from degradation caused by improper development. These criteria and standards will secure the public health, safety and welfare by:

A.    Reducing risk of damage due to erosion, flooding, and landslides;

B.    Reducing the risks to the public from personal injury, loss of life, or property damage;

C.    Maintaining surface water quality and protecting groundwater areas which help recharge (purify or resupply) rivers, streams, and aquifers;

D.    Maintaining and protecting priority fish and wildlife habitats;

E.    Maintaining and protecting priority habitat of threatened and endangered wildlife species;

F.    Maintaining the water quality and quantity to meet human and wildlife needs;

G.    Minimizing the loss of life, injury, and property damage due to natural hazards such as flooding, landslides, seismic events, and volcanic eruptions, minimizing the need for emergency rescue, and avoiding the cost of replacing public facilities;

H.    Recognizing and addressing the cumulative adverse impacts that could degrade or deplete water resources, wetlands or fish and wildlife habitat, or exacerbate flooding and landslide hazards;

I.    Alerting the public to the development limitations and hazards associated with critical areas;

J.    Implementing the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the Centralia comprehensive plan and the Washington State Growth Management Act, including incorporation of best available science in the designation, protection, and management of critical areas, with special consideration for the protection of anadromous fish. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.040 Scope and applicability.

A.    This chapter applies to any public or private activity or action which would alter the condition of any land, water or vegetation, or construct or alter any structure or improvement regulated by this title, on any land which meets the classification standards for any critical area defined herein. Such activities or actions include but are not limited to:

1.    Building, demolition, clearing, grading, grubbing, filling;

2.    Subdivisions and short plats;

3.    Reclassifications, site plan approvals, shoreline developments and special and conditional use permits;

4.    Temporary use permits, variances, exceptions and waivers.

B.    The regulations of the critical area chapters shall apply to all development, activity, actions, uses and construction proposed or undertaken within the jurisdiction of the city.

C.    The critical area chapters shall apply to all properties which are designated as critical areas by the city. Properties containing portions of critical areas are subject to the critical area chapters. When the requirements of the critical area chapters are in conflict with other city of Centralia ordinances or regulations, the more restrictive shall apply as determined by the director.

D.    Where one site is classified as containing two or more critical areas, the project shall meet the minimum standards and requirements for each identified critical area as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.050 Access.

A.    Access to Enable Administration of This Chapter. Property owners shall, as a requirement of critical area permits issued pursuant to this chapter, grant access to the city for the purpose of identifying, inspecting, monitoring, and taking such actions as are necessary to enforce this chapter. City officials will make a reasonable effort to contact the property owner before entering onto private property. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.060 Relationship to other regulations.

A.    Variance applications from the provisions of the zoning regulations shall be made according to the provisions of CMC Title 20.

B.    The critical area regulations establish minimum standards which are to be applied to specific activities in critical areas in order to achieve the purposes stated. In no way are the critical area regulations intended to limit the application of SEPA or any other city, county, state or federal law or regulation. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.070 Permitted uses.

Uses permitted on properties designated as critical areas shall be the same as those permitted by the underlying zone classification and the city of Centralia shoreline master program unless otherwise indicated by specific critical area regulations. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.080 Exemptions.

An exemption means that an activity is fully exempt from critical areas review, and not subject to the provisions of this chapter. The proponent of the activity may submit a written subject request for exemption to the director that describes the activity and states the exemption listed in this section that applies. The director shall review the request to verify that it complies with this chapter and approve or deny the exemption as an administrative decision. All exempted activities shall use best management practices to the greatest extent to avoid potential impacts to critical areas. The following developments, activities and associated uses shall be exempt:

A.    Agricultural activities on existing agricultural properties when such activities directly relate to the continuing operation of the property for agricultural purposes;

B.    Forest practices regulated and conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 76.09 RCW and forest practices regulations, WAC Title 222, and which are exempt from the city of Centralia’s jurisdiction; provided, that forest practice conversions are not exempt;

Normal repair of buildings and structures involves restoring to a state comparable to the original condition including the replacement of walls, fixtures and plumbing; provided, that the value of work and materials in any twelve-month period does not exceed twenty-five percent of the value of the structure prior to such work as determined by using the most recently adopted IBC construction tables, the repair does not expand the number of dwelling units in a residential building, the building or structure is not physically expanded, and, in the case of damaged buildings and structures, a complete application for repair is accepted by the department within six months of the event and repair is completed within the terms of the permit;

G.    Emergency action necessary to prevent imminent threat or danger to public health or safety, or to public or private property, or serious environmental degradation. The director shall review all proposed emergency actions to determine the existence of the emergency and reasonableness of the proposed actions taken. After the completion of emergency actions, the person or agency undertaking the action shall fully restore and/or mitigate any impacts to the critical area and buffers resulting from the action in accordance with an approved critical area report and mitigation plan. Restoration and/or mitigation activities must be completed within one year of the date of the emergency. Federal and/or state permits may be required;

H.    Any change of use entirely within an existing structure, provided no grading or paving will occur which increases the amount of impervious surface on the site; and

I.    Projects with the primary purpose of restoring or enhancing wetlands, streams, or fish and wildlife habitat areas; provided, that:

1.    Such projects are part of an approved local, state, or federal restoration or enhancement plan; and

If compliance with this chapter together with applicable city regulations or plans is physically impossible, the provisions of this chapter shall govern, unless it would jeopardize public safety.

D.    Review Process and Approval Authority.

1.    Permit Review Process. Applications for permits or approvals listed in Table 1 shall be subject to a Type I, Type II, or Type III review, notice, and approval process, as described in CMC Title 20.

2.    Rejection of an Application. In addition to the requirements of CMC Title 20 pertaining to complete applications, the approval authority may reject all or part of an application and supporting information, including any required special report, based upon:

a.    Factual errors or omissions; or

b.    Inconsistencies between the submitted materials and observable data and accepted scientific or technical criteria; or

c.    Faulty analysis or analytical procedures.

3.    Decisions. The approval authority may approve, deny, or approve with conditions proposed uses and activities consistent with the applicable provisions of this chapter. The city shall issue a decision for each application involving a critical area and/or its associated buffer in accordance with the applicable Type I, II, or III review process described in CMC Title 20.

4.    Resubmittal of Denied Permit Applications. A critical area permit which has been denied may be modified and resubmitted.

E.    Appeals. Administrative decisions may be appealed pursuant to CMC Title 20; provided, that if the proposal is subject to SEPA, the appeal periods for the CAP shall be as specified in this section. Hearing examiner decisions may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 2.18 CMC.

F.    Authorized Activity Time Period.

1.    Permit Duration. Authorization to undertake regulated uses and activities within critical areas, associated buffers, and riparian management zones shall be valid for the specific time period established in any associated development permit (e.g., building permit, shoreline permit and special use authorization), except when otherwise established by the approval authority pursuant to this chapter. CAPs for projects that do not require an additional city permit shall be valid for three years unless otherwise specified in the permit.

2.    Permit Extension. Prior to deciding whether to grant a requested extension to a permit for a period of three years, the community development director may require updated studies if needed. If the director determines that the development would be enlarged or significantly altered through the renewal, or if the applicant failed to abide by the terms of the original permit, the extension may be denied. Extensions may also be limited by other associated permits (e.g., shoreline permit, building permit, etc.).

G.    The director may refer applications for critical area permits to appropriate federal, state, local, and city agencies and departments for review and comment.

H.    The director may apply conditions to the approval in order to ensure the conformance with standards and policies and to ensure that construction occurs in compliance with the standards and other conditions.

I.    Costs of compliance with Chapters 16.16 through 16.23 CMC are the responsibility of the party seeking the permit. (Ord. 2396 § 3, 2017: Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.110 Reasonable use exception.

An exception means that an activity may receive special consideration and relief from certain provisions of Chapters 16.16 through 16.23 CMC, but the activity is subject to Chapters 16.16 through 16.23 CMC, and must undergo full critical areas review. An applicant may apply for a reasonable use exception if it can be demonstrated that application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the subject property.

The hearing examiner may grant a reasonable use exception if strict adherence to the provisions of this chapter would deny minimal reasonable use of the property, or to allow a necessary use or activity which is prohibited or not allowed as proposed by this chapter.

A.    Submittal Requirements. Applications for reasonable use exceptions and any supporting information shall be filed with community development on a form provided by that department. The applications shall contain the following information:

1.    A description of the proposed development, including the proposed site plan;

2.    Any required special reports;

3.    Alternatives to the proposal that were considered and the reasons why they were rejected;

4.    Deviations from the provisions of this chapter needed to accommodate the proposed development;

5.    Delineation of setbacks required by CMC Title 20, relative to critical areas and associated buffers;

6.    Identification and evaluation of the potential impacts the proposed development would have on critical area(s), associated buffer(s) and their functions;

7.    Analysis of how the project meets the review criteria listed below; and

8.    Any other information the city deems necessary in order to make a determination regarding the request.

B.    Review Criteria.

1.    The application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property;

2.    No other reasonable use of the property has less impact on the critical area;

3.    Any alteration to a critical area and/or its associated buffer or impairment of critical area and buffer functions is the minimum necessary to allow minimal reasonable use of the property; and

4.    Situation Not Created by Owner. The applicant’s inability to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of their actions after the effective date of this title or its predecessor.

C.    Permitting authority for critical areas within the shoreline jurisdiction is under the shoreline master program (SMP). This section is not applicable to critical areas located within the shoreline jurisdiction unless specifically adopted by the SMP. See the Centralia shoreline master program for permitting information in these areas. (Ord. 2396 § 4, 2017: Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.120 Nonconforming structures, uses, and activities.

An established use or existing structure that was lawfully permitted prior to the adoption of this chapter, but which is not in compliance with this chapter, may continue, subject to the provisions of Chapter 20.93 CMC and the shoreline master program. (Ord. 2396 § 5, 2017: Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.130 Bonds and financial guarantees.

The director may require an applicant to submit a financial guarantee to the city to guarantee any performance, mitigation, maintenance, or monitoring required as a condition of permit approval. The permit shall not be issued until the appropriate financial guarantee is received by the director. Financial guarantees shall be in the amount of one hundred fifty percent of the estimate of the cost of mitigation or monitoring to allow for inflation and administration should the city have to complete the mitigation or monitoring.

Irrevocable letters of credit or escrow bonds shall be executed by financial institutions acceptable to the city and authorized to conduct business in the state of Washington, and must be in the form approved by the city. The bond or letter of credit as required by this section must be posted prior to building permit issuance. The length of time a bond will be held for is determined during the permitting process and based upon the requirements of each individual section of the critical areas ordinance with the addition of one year, if applicable.

Upon completion, inspection, approval, and acceptance of the performance, mitigation, maintenance or monitoring, the security, less fifteen percent, shall be released to the developer. The fifteen percent shall be held for a minimum of one year following final inspection and acceptance to warrant performance, mitigation, maintenance or monitoring for this time period, if applicable.

The director shall require the applicant to post a cash performance bond or other security acceptable to the director in an amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to fulfill the requirements of Chapters 16.16 through 16.23 CMC and any applicable conditions of approval. The amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The director shall release the bond when all activities have been completed consistent with this chapter and when a maintenance bond has been posted.

The director shall require the holder of an approval issued pursuant to this chapter to post a cash performance bond or other security acceptable to the director in an amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to guarantee that structures, improvements, and mitigation required by the permit or by this chapter perform satisfactorily for a period of three to ten years after they have been completed. The director shall release the maintenance bond upon determining that performance standards established for evaluating the effectiveness and success of the structures, improvements, and/or compensatory mitigation have been satisfactorily met for the required period. (Ord. 2232 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.16.140 Enforcement and violation—Penalty.

A.    No regulated activity, as defined in this chapter, shall be conducted without a permit and without full compliance with this chapter. All activities not allowed or conditionally approved shall be prohibited.

B.    The community development director (CDD) shall have authority to enforce this chapter, issue delineation verifications, permits, and violation notices, and process violations through the use of administrative orders, stop work orders, and/or civil and criminal actions as provided for herein, and as listed in CMC Title 20.

C.    In the event of a violation, the CDD shall have the authority to order restoration, enhancement, or creation measures to compensate for the destroyed or degraded critical area. If work is not completed in a reasonable time following the order, the CDD may implement a process to restore or enhance the affected site. This includes but is not limited to creation of new wetlands or streams to offset loss as a result of violation of the provisions in this chapter. The violator shall be liable for all costs of such action, including administrative costs.

D.    Failure to comply with an administrative order of the CDD under this section shall constitute a violation subject to enforcement pursuant to this section.

1.    Damages. The city may recover all costs, fees, and expenses in connection with enforcement actions as damages against the violator.

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the use of land on and around wetlands; to protect wetlands from new nearby activities; to comply with the Washington State Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, and other city and state regulations and policies; and to protect the public health, safety and welfare by preventing the adverse environmental impacts of development. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.020 Applicability.

Wetlands and wetland buffers are those areas within the city and its jurisdiction which satisfy the definitions established in this title. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.030 Mapping.

A.    The approximate location and extent of wetlands in the city is displayed on the map titled Wetlands and Hydric Soils, 2001. This inventory is general and not designed to support permit applications, and does not establish jurisdictional boundaries. Furthermore, as site conditions change (due to natural and human processes), wetland areas and characteristics may change as well.

B.    The exact location of the wetland boundary shall be determined by the applicant through the performance of a field investigation applying the wetland definition provided in this title. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.040 Wetlands rating.

A.    Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Department of Ecology wetland rating system found in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Department of Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, October 2014) or as amended hereafter. This document contains the definitions and methods for determining if the criteria below are met.

Wetlands buffer widths, replacement ratios and avoidance criteria shall be based on this rating system. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the regulated wetland exists on the date of adoption of the rating system by the city, as the regulated wetland may naturally change in accordance with permitted activities. Wetland rating categories shall not be altered to recognize illegal modifications.

1.    Washington State Four-Tier Wetlands Rating System.

a.    Category I Criteria.

i.    Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre.

ii.    Wetlands that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR as high quality wetlands.

iii.    All bogs.

iv.    Mature and old growth forested wetlands larger than one acre.

v.    Wetlands in coastal lagoons.

vi.    Wetlands that perform functions at high levels scoring twenty-three points or more on the questions related to functions.

b.    Category I wetlands are those that:

i.    Represent a unique or rare wetland type; or

ii.    Are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or

iii.    Are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or

iv.    Provide a high level of functions.

c.    Category II Criteria.

i.    Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

ii.    Wetlands judged to perform most functions relatively well (scoring twenty to twenty-two points on the questions related to functions), or performed one group of functions very well and the other two moderately well.

d.    Category III Criteria. Wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scores between sixteen and nineteen points) and often can be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project.

e.    Category IV Criteria. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scores less than sixteen points) and are often heavily disturbed.

B.    Very Small Wetland Standards. Very small wetlands of four thousand square feet or less may or may not provide wetland functions that require protection. The following standards apply to regulating wetlands of four thousand square feet or less:

1.    For a wetland less than one thousand square feet to be declared exempt, it must be shown by the applicant that the following criteria have been met:

a.    They are not associated with a riparian corridor; and

b.    They are not part of a wetland mosaic; and

c.    They do not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

2.    The requirement to avoid impacts may be dropped for Category III and IV wetlands between one thousand and four thousand square feet that meet all of the following criteria:

a.    Wetland is not associated with a riparian corridor; and

b.    Wetland is not part of a wetland mosaic; and

c.    Wetland does not score five points or greater for habitat in the 2014 Western Washington Rating System; and

d.    Wetland does not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

3.    Impacts allowed under this provision to these wetlands will be fully mitigated as required in mitigation sections CMC 16.17.070 and 16.17.080.

C.    Date of Wetland Rating. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the rating system by the city, as the wetland naturally changes thereafter, or as the wetland changes in accordance with permitted activities. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications. (Ord. 2396 § 7, 2017: Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.050 Development standards.

A.    Activities may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions and functional performance of the wetland and other critical areas.

B.    Activities and uses shall be prohibited in wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this title.

C.    Category I Wetlands. Activities and uses shall be prohibited from Category I, except as provided for in the public agency and utility exception, reasonable use exception, and variance sections of this title.

D.    Category II and III Wetlands. With respect to activities proposed in Category II and III wetlands, the following standard shall apply:

1.    Water-dependent activities as provided for under the city’s shoreline master program may be allowed where there are no feasible alternatives that would have a less adverse impact on the wetland, its buffers and other critical areas.

2.    Where nonwater-dependent activities are proposed, it shall be presumed that alternative locations are available, and activities and uses shall be prohibited, unless the applicant demonstrates that:

a.    The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished and successfully avoid or result in less adverse impact on a wetland on another site or sites in the general region;

b.    All alternative designs of the project as proposed that would avoid or result in less of an adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer, such as a reduction in the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project, are not feasible; and

c.    Full compensation for the acreage and loss of functions will be provided under the terms established under CMC 16.17.070(G), Mitigation Requirements.

E.    Category IV Wetlands. Activities and uses that result in unavoidable and necessary impacts may be permitted in Category IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved wetland report and mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives. Full compensation for the acreage and loss of functions will be provided under the terms established under CMC 16.17.070(G), Mitigation Ratios.

F.    Buffers. Wetland buffer zones shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to regulated wetlands. Any wetland created, restored or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall also include a buffer equivalent to or greater than that required for the category of wetland to be replaced. Buffer widths presume the existence of relatively intact native vegetation within the buffer zone that is adequate to protect the wetland values and functions. If the vegetation is inadequate, then the buffer width may be increased or additional plants added to maintain the width. The width of the wetland buffer shall be based on the wetland category according to the following table:

1.    Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured horizontally from a perpendicular line established at the wetland edge as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. Only fully vegetated buffers will be considered. Lawns, walkways, driveways, and other mowed or paved areas will not be considered buffers. The following table provides examples of measures that can minimize impacts to wetlands from proposed change in land use:

	Examples of Disturbance	Activities and Uses that Cause Disturbances	Examples of Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	• Parking lots

• Warehouse

• Manufacturing

• Residential	• Direct lights away from wetland

	Noise	• Manufacturing

• Residential	• Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland

	Toxic runoff*	• Parking lots

• Roads

• Manufacturing

• Residential areas

• Application of agricultural pesticides

• Landscaping	• Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered

• Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 feet of wetland

• Apply integrated pest management

	Stormwater runoff	• Parking lots

• Roads

• Manufacturing

• Residential areas

• Commercial

• Landscaping	• Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development

• Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer

	Change in water regime	• Impermeable surfaces

• Lawns

• Tilling	• Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns

	Pets and human disturbance	• Residential areas	• Use privacy fencing; plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion; place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract

	Dust	• Tilled fields	• Use best management practices to control dust

*These examples are not necessarily adequate for minimizing toxic runoff if threatened or endangered species are present at the site.

2.    Increased Buffers. The director may require additional buffer width around a wetland on a case-by-case basis when it can be demonstrated that the increase is necessary to:

a.    Protect the function and value of the wetland; or

b.    Protect habitat for federally or state listed fish and wildlife species, or federally listed plant species.

c.    An additional buffer width may be increased in accordance with the recommendations of an experienced, qualified professional wetland scientist, and the best available science.

3.    Buffer Width Averaging Standards. Buffer averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following are met:

a.    The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a dual-rated wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower rated area; and

b.    The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower functioning or less sensitive portion; and

c.    The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required with averaging; and

d.    The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-quarters of the standard width.

e.    Buffer width averaging standards may not be used in conjunction with buffer reduction standards.

Averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following are met:

a.    There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging; and

b.    The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a report from a qualified wetland professional; and

c.    The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

d.    The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-quarters of the required width.

4.    Buffer Width Reduction Standards. The director may reduce the standard wetland buffer zone widths on a case-by-case basis where it can be demonstrated by a qualified professional wetland scientist that:

a.    The proposal will not reduce the function and value of the wetland;

b.    The proposal will not reduce the function of a habitat for federally or state listed fish and wildlife species, or federally listed plant species; or

c.    A buffer enhancement plan using native vegetation may be required to maintain the functional attributes of the buffer. An enhanced buffer shall not result in greater than a twenty-five percent reduction in the buffer width or a reduced buffer less than fifty feet, whichever is larger.

d.    Buffer width reduction standards may not be used in conjunction with buffer averaging standards.

5.    Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this title, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed or enhanced condition. Where buffer disturbance has occurred during construction, revegetation with native vegetation will be required.

6.    Permitted Buffer Uses. The following activities shall be allowed within a wetland or wetland buffer provided they are conducted using best management practices:

a.    Activities on areas lying fallow as part of a conventional rotational cycle are part of an ongoing operation. Activities which bring an area into agricultural use are not part of an ongoing operation. An operation ceases to be ongoing when the area on which it was conducted has been converted to another use;

b.    Conservation and Restoration Activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife;

c.    Passive Recreation. Low-impact uses and activities which are consistent with the purpose and function of the wetland buffer and do not detract from its integrity may be permitted within the buffer depending on the sensitivity of the wetland. Trails may be permitted at the discretion of the director if they are limited to permeable surfaces no more than five feet wide and located within the outer twenty-five percent of the buffer. Trails must be designed to avoid removal of significant trees. Trails shall not be permitted in the wetlands themselves except for minor crossings that minimize impact;

d.    Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities, limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls, storm ponds and bioswales, may be allowed within the outer seventy-five percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only; provided, that no other location is feasible and the location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland;

e.    Navigation aids and boundary markers;

f.    Boat mooring buoys;

g.    The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions or water sources; and

h.    The following uses are allowed within wetlands and/or wetland buffers; provided, that written notice at least ten days prior to the commencement of such work has been given to the director; and provided, that wetland impacts are minimized and that disturbed areas are immediately restored:

i.    Normal maintenance, repair, or operation of existing serviceable structures, facilities, or improved areas. Maintenance and repair does not include any modification that changes the character, scope, or size of the original structure, facility, or improved area and does not include the construction of a maintenance road; and

ii.    Minor modification of existing serviceable structures within a buffer zone where modification does not adversely impact wetland functions.

7.    Regulated Buffer Uses. An approval from the director shall be obtained prior to undertaking the following in a regulated wetland or its buffer unless authorized:

a.    The removal, excavation, grading, or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, minerals, organic matter, or material of any kind;

b.    The dumping, discharging, or filling with any material;

c.    The draining, flooding, or disturbing of the water level or water table;

d.    The driving of pilings;

e.    The placing of obstructions;

f.    The construction, reconstruction, demolition, or expansion of any structure;

g.    The destruction or alteration of wetlands vegetation through clearing, harvesting, intentional burning, or planting of vegetation within a regulated wetland or its buffer that would alter the character of a regulated wetland; provided, that these activities are not part of a forest practice governed under Chapter 76.09 RCW and its rules; or

h.    Activities adjacent to a regulated wetland that result in a significant adverse impact to the functions and values provided by the wetland or its buffer;

i.    For Category I wetlands, an applicant must demonstrate that denial of the permit would impose an extraordinary hardship on the part of the applicant brought about by circumstances peculiar to the subject property;

j.    For Category II and III wetlands, the following provision shall apply:

Where nonwater-dependent activities are proposed, it shall be presumed that adverse impacts are avoidable. This presumption may be rebutted upon a demonstration that the basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished utilizing one or more other sites in the general region that would avoid, or result in less, adverse impact on a regulated wetland; and a reduction in the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project as proposed and all alternative designs of the project as proposed that would avoid, or result in less, adverse impact on a regulated wetland or its buffer will not accomplish the basic purpose of the project; and in cases where the applicant has rejected alternatives to the project as proposed due to constraints such as zoning, deficiencies of infrastructure, or parcel size, the applicant has made reasonable attempt to remove or accommodate such constraints;

k.    With respect to Category IV wetlands, unavoidable and necessary impacts can be demonstrated where the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative which will accomplish the applicant’s objectives.

8.    Signs and Fencing. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the director may require the applicant to install temporary or permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer.

a.    Buffer Marking. Buffer markers may be required around the outer perimeter of the wetland or buffer and the limits of the areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization. Markers shall be placed in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur, and inspected by the director prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

b.    Permanent Signs. Permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every fifty feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:

Protected Wetland Area

Do Not Disturb

Contact City of Centralia (360) 330-7662

Regarding Uses and Restriction

c.    Fencing. The director shall determine if fencing is necessary to protect the functions and values of the critical area. If found to be necessary, the director shall require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer. The applicant will be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on site. The fencing shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration and constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. Fencing will usually be black vinyl coated chain link to blend in with the native landscaping unless approved by the director. In no case shall the following types of fencing be allowed: uncoated chain link, masonry, block, wood, or other sight obscuring material. (Ord. 2396 § 8, 2017: Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.060 Wetland study.

A.    Critical area reports for wetlands must meet the requirements of this section.

B.    The wetland study shall be prepared by a qualified professional who is a wetland biologist with experience preparing wetland reports.

C.    A wetland study shall contain the following site- and proposal-related information at a minimum:

4.    A discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing wetlands and restore any wetlands that were degraded prior to the current proposed land use activity;

5.    The purposes of the project and an explanation why the proposed activity cannot be located at other sites including an explanation of how the proposed activity is dependent upon wetlands or water-related resources; except that proposals to alter prior converted cropland need not provide this explanation;

6.    Proposed mitigation, if needed, including a written assessment and accompanying maps of the mitigation area, including the following information at a minimum:

a.    Existing and proposed wetland acreage;

b.    Vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic conditions;

e.    Existing and proposed adjacent site conditions;

f.    Required wetland buffers; and

g.    Property ownership;

7.    A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect wetlands after the project site has been developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs.

a.    The director may require additional information including, but not limited to, an assessment of wetland functional characteristics, including a discussion of the methodology used; documentation of the ecological, aesthetic, economic, or other values of a wetland; a study of flood, erosion, or other hazards at the site and the effect of any protective measures that might be taken to reduce such hazards; and any other information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this chapter or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this chapter.

b.    When appropriate, the director may also require the wetland analysis to include an evaluation by the Department of Ecology or an independent qualified expert regarding the applicant’s analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, and to include any recommendations as appropriate. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.070 Mitigation requirements.

A.    Compensating for Wetland Impacts. As a condition of any permit allowing alteration of wetland and/or wetland buffers, or as an enforcement action pursuant to CMC 16.16.140, the city shall require that the applicant demonstrate that wetland impact avoidance is not possible and engage in the restoration, creation or enhancement of wetlands and their buffers in order to offset the impacts resulting from the applicant’s or violator’s actions. Mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Mitigation plans shall be consistent with the Washington State Department of Ecology Wetland Mitigation in Washington State: Part 2—Developing Mitigation Plans, March 2006, as revised. The applicant shall develop a plan that provides for land acquisition, construction, maintenance and monitoring of replacement wetlands that recreate as nearly as possible the original wetlands in terms of acreage, function, geographic location and setting, and that are larger than the original wetlands. Compensatory mitigation shall be completed prior to wetland destruction, where possible. Mitigation shall result in no net loss of wetlands function and acreage and seeks a net resource gain in wetlands over present conditions with the exception of enforcement actions.

B.    Mitigation shall be required in the following order of preference:

1.    Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

2.    Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts.

3.    Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment.

4.    Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations.

5.    Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments. This type of mitigation can include an in-lieu of program established by the city.

C.    Mitigation for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensatory mitigation actions shall address functions affected by the alteration to achieve functional equivalency or improvement and shall provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when:

1.    The lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific function assessment, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

2.    Out-of-kind replacement will best meet formally identified watershed goals, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

D.    Mitigation actions that require compensation by replacing, enhancing, or substitution shall occur in the following order of preference:

1.    Restoring wetlands on upland sites that were formerly wetlands.

2.    Creating wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species. This should only be attempted when there is a consistent source of hydrology and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is being designed.

3.    Enhancing significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation. Such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

E.    Type and Location of Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach, such as a mitigation bank located within WRIA 23 Upper Chehalis Watershed or the city of Centralia-sponsored fee-in-lieu program compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in-kind and on-site, or in-kind and within the same stream reach, subbasin, or drift cell. Mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site as the alteration except when all of the following apply:

1.    There are no reasonable on-site or in-subdrainage basin opportunities or on-site and in-subdrainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success, after a determination of the natural capacity of the site to mitigate for the impacts. Consideration should include: anticipated wetland mitigation replacement ratios, buffer conditions and proposed widths, hydrogeomorphic classes of on-site wetlands when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity);

2.    Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland; and

3.    Off-site locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless:

a.    Established watershed goals for water quality, flood or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or

b.    Credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as mitigation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the bank’s certification; or

c.    The mitigation occurs as part of a city of Centralia-sponsored fee-in-lieu program.

F.    Timing for wetland impacts shall be completed prior to activities that will disturb wetlands. In all other cases, mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the activity or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora. The director may authorize a one-time temporary delay, up to one hundred twenty days, in completing minor construction and landscaping when environmental conditions could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties. The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the city and include a financial guarantee.

G.    Mitigation Ratios. The following ratios shall apply to creation or restoration which is in-kind, on-site, timed prior to or concurrent with alteration, and has a high probability of success. These ratios do not apply to remedial actions resulting from unauthorized alterations. The first number specifies the acreage of replacement wetlands and the second specifies the acreage of wetlands impacted.

	Category and Type of Wetland Impacts	Reestablishment or Creation	Rehabilitation Only	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Rehabilitation (RH)	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E)	Enhancement Only

	All Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 R/C and 1:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	6:1

	All Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 4:1 E	8:1

	All Category II	3:1	6:1	1:1 R/C and 4:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 8:1 E	12:1

	Category I Forested	6:1	12:1	1:1 R/C and 10:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 20:1 E	24:1

	Category I Based on Score for Functions	4:1	8:1	1:1 R/C and 6:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 12:1 E	16:1

	Category I Natural Heritage Site	Not considered possible1	6:1 rehabilitation of a natural heritage site1	R/C not considered possible1	R/C not considered possible1	Case-by-case

	Category I Bog	Not considered possible1	6:1 rehabilitation of a bog1	R/C not considered possible1	R/C not considered possible1	Case-by-case

1.    Natural heritage sites and bogs are considered irreplacable wetlands because they perform some special functions that cannot be replaced through compensatory mitigation. Impacts to such wetlands would therefore result in a net loss of some functions no matter what kind of compensation is proposed.

1.    Increased Replacement Ratio. The director may increase the ratios under the following circumstances:

a.    Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation;

b.    A significant period of time will elapse between impact and replication of wetland functions;

c.    Proposed mitigation will result in a lower category wetland or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted; or

d.    The impact was an unauthorized impact.

2.    Decreased Replacement Ratio. The city may decrease these ratios for Category II, III, and IV wetlands under the following circumstances:

a.    Documentation by a qualified wetlands specialist demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions have a very high likelihood of success;

b.    Documentation by a qualified wetlands specialist demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the wetland being impacted;

c.    The proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of the impact and have been shown to be successful.

3.    In all cases, a minimum acreage replacement ratio of one-to-one shall be required.

4.    At the discretion of the director, the city may use fees in lieu of reestablishment, rehabilitation, creation or enhancement proposed through mitigation for an established wetlands enhancement program.

H.    Wetlands Enhancement, Cooperative Restoration, and Preservation for Mitigation.

1.    Any applicant proposing to alter wetlands may propose to enhance existing significantly degraded wetlands in order to compensate for wetland losses. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands must produce a wetland study that identifies how enhancement will increase the functions of the degraded wetland and how this increase will adequately mitigate for the loss of wetland area and function at the impact site. An enhancement proposal must also show whether existing wetland functions will be reduced by the enhancement actions.

2.    A wetlands enhancement compensation project shall be determined pursuant to this section; provided, that enhancement for one function and value will not degrade another function or value and that acreage replacement ratios shall, at a minimum, be doubled to recognize existing functional values. Only Category III and IV wetlands are eligible for enhancement.

3.    Cooperative Restoration. The city may encourage, facilitate, and approve cooperative projects wherein a single applicant or other organization with demonstrated capability may undertake a compensation project with funding from other applicants under the following circumstances:

a.    Restoration, creation or enhancement at a particular site may be scientifically difficult or impossible;

b.    Creation of one or several larger wetlands may be preferable to many small wetlands;

c.    Persons proposing cooperative compensation projects shall submit a joint permit application, demonstrate compliance with all standards, demonstrate the organizational and fiscal capability to act cooperatively, and demonstrate that long-term management can and will be provided.

4.    Wetland Preservation as Mitigation. Impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by preservation of wetland areas in a separate tract or easement, when used in combination with other forms of mitigation such as creation, restoration, or enhancement at the preservation site or at a separate location. Preservation may also be used by itself, but more restrictions as outlined below will apply. Preservation as mitigation is acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement providing that a minimum of one-to-one acreage replacement is provided by restoration or creation and the criteria below are met:

a.    The impact area is small, and impacts are to a Category III or IV wetland;

b.    Preservation sites include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation; and

c.    Mitigation ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation shall range from ten-to-one to twenty-to-one, as determined by the city, depending on the quality of the wetlands being mitigated and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.

I.    Wetland Mitigation Banks.

1.    Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:

a.    The bank is certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC; and

b.    The director determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

c.    The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.

2.    Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

3.    Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, bank service areas may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions.

J.    Wetland Mitigation Monitoring. The mitigation plan shall include a program for monitoring construction of the compensation project and for assessing a completed project. A protocol shall be included outlining the schedule for site monitoring, and how the monitoring data will be evaluated. At a minimum, the monitoring program will continue for at least five years from the date of plant installation. Monitoring will continue for ten years where woody vegetation (forested or shrub wetlands) is the intended result. These communities take at least eight years after planting to reach eighty percent canopy closure. Reporting for a ten-year monitoring period shall occur in years one, two, three, five, seven and ten. A monitoring report shall be submitted as needed to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project. The compensation project shall be monitored for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period less than five years. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.080 Mitigation plans.

All wetland restoration, compensation, creation, and/or enhancement projects required pursuant to this chapter either as a permit condition or as the result of an enforcement action shall follow a mitigation plan prepared by qualified wetland professionals approved by the director. Unless waived by the director, in consultation with resource agencies, mitigation plans shall be prepared by qualified wetlands professionals and shall contain the following:

A.    Baseline information for the impacted and any compensation site including written assessment and accompanying maps of the existing acreage; vegetative, faunal and hydrologic conditions; relationship within watershed and to existing water bodies; soil and substrate conditions; topographic elevations; existing and proposed adjacent site conditions; buffers; and ownership;

B.    Specific criteria (including water quality standards, survival rates of planted vegetation, species abundance and diversity targets, or other ecological, geological or hydrological criteria) for evaluating the mitigation proposal relative to the objectives of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the city’s comprehensive plan;

C.    A description of how lost functional values will be replaced;

D.    Specifics on when mitigation will occur relative to project construction and to the requirements of permits required by other jurisdictions;

E.    Detailed construction plans which establish the appropriate methods of construction, sequencing, and times of construction;

F.    Provisions for monitoring the mitigation area to determine whether the mitigation plan is successful. Monitoring of the area shall include:

1.    At a minimum, the monitoring program will continue for at least five years from the date of plant installation. Monitoring will continue for ten years where woody vegetation (forested or shrub wetlands) is the intended result. These communities take at least eight years after planting to reach eighty percent canopy closure. Reporting for a ten-year monitoring period shall occur in years one, two, three, five, seven and ten. A monitoring report shall be submitted as needed to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project;

2.    Provisions for monetary security as established in CMC 16.16.130, Bonds and financial guarantees, in an amount equal to one hundred fifteen percent of the estimated funds necessary to complete work and monitoring in accordance with the mitigation plan, including restoration or rehabilitation to be performed if planned mitigation fails within the designated period of implementation. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.090 Performance standards—Subdivision.

The subdivision and short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers is subject to the following:

A.    Land that is located wholly within a wetland or its buffer may not be subdivided.

B.    Land that is located partially within a wetland or its buffer may be subdivided; provided, that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot is located outside of the wetland and its buffer.

C.    Access roads and utilities serving the proposed subdivision may be permitted within the wetland and associated buffers only if the city determines that no other feasible alternative exists and is consistent with other provisions of this title. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.110 Nonconforming activities.

An activity that was approved prior to the passage of this chapter but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the provisions of CMC Title 20. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.120 Reasonable use exception.

After it has been determined by the city that losses of wetland are unavoidable and all options have been considered and that all reasonable economic use has been denied, an exception may be applied for and be granted if the permit, on its face or as conditioned, is consistent with CMC 16.16.110, Reasonable use exception, and the following criteria:

A.    The impact is both unavoidable and necessary due to site-specific constraints;

B.    The proposed activity results in no net loss of wetland;

C.    Denial of a permit would cause an extraordinary hardship on the applicant;

D.    In designing the request the applicant shall take deliberate measures to minimize wetland impacts. Steps to minimize impacts to wetlands shall include but are not limited to reduced project scope, sensitive site design, best management practices, off-site construction staging, limiting the season of construction, and consultation with resource agencies in site design.

E.    The hearing examiner may impose any conditions necessary to ensure compliance with the goals of this chapter and the comprehensive plan.

F.    Permitting authority for critical areas within the shoreline jurisdiction is under the shoreline master program (SMP). This section is not applicable to critical areas located within the shoreline jurisdiction unless specifically adopted by the SMP. See Centralia shoreline master program for permitting information in these areas. (Ord. 2396 § 9, 2017: Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.130 Modification of wetland permits.

A wetland permit holder may request and the city may approve modification of a previously issued wetland permit. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.17.140 Amendments.

These regulations and the National Wetland Inventory or subsequent Lewis County Wetland Inventory may from time to time be amended in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the general statues and as new information concerning wetland location, soils, hydrology, flooding, or wetland plants and wildlife becomes available. (Ord. 2232 § 5 (Exh. A), 2009).

This chapter is adopted under the authority of RCW 36.70A.020. (Ord. 2232 § 6 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.18.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate development and the use of land in critical aquifer recharge area (CARA) in order to ensure long-term protection of the water supply resources that exist under the city’s jurisdiction; and to comply with the Washington State Growth Management Act. (Ord. 2232 § 6 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.18.030 Applicability.

A. Critical aquifer recharge areas are areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water. These areas can fall within the city’s jurisdiction where the prevailing geologic conditions allow infiltration rates which create a high potential for contamination of groundwater resources or contribute to the replenishment of groundwater. Critical aquifer recharge areas are rated as having high, moderate, or low susceptibility to contamination based on soil permeability, geologic matrix, infiltration, and depth to water as determined by the criteria established by the state Department of Ecology.

B. The approximate location and extent of critical aquifer recharge area and municipal wellhead protection areas are shown on the aquifer protection overlay. This overlay is to identify and classify vulnerable aquifer recharge areas within the city’s jurisdiction. Protection of the aquifer within the critical aquifer recharge area is to be accomplished by controlling the use and handling of hazardous substances. Restrictions on development may be placed in order to protect public health and safety by preserving the existing and future groundwater supply for the city and urban growth area pursuant to the performance standards of CMC 16.18.040(H) and the city of Centralia wellhead protection plan. (Ord. 2232 § 6 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.18.040 Regulations.

A.    Activities may only be permitted in a critical aquifer recharge area if the community development director (director) determines that the proposed activity will not cause contaminants to enter the critical aquifer and that the proposed activity will not adversely affect the recharging of the critical aquifer.

B.    Any development which occurs within the city’s jurisdiction will use best management practices (BMPs) to prevent chemical and biological contaminants from entering underground waters and aquifers which are now, or in the future, likely to be used as a potable drinking water source. All persons, corporations, or other legal entities that engage in the construction of regulated facilities contained in Chapters 16.16 through 16.23 CMC must first obtain approval by the city through the critical area permit process (certificate of compliance) and building permit(s).

C.    To obtain city water hookups and services for any real property in the critical aquifer recharge area, city sewer hookups and services are required in compliance with CMC 15.04.050. This code allows the public works director to review individual cases for exception to this restriction. If the public works director has determined that new construction, any change in the intensity or use of land such as an increase in dwelling units or a change to a commercial or industrial use from a less intense use and/or subdivisions cannot connect to city sewer within the critical aquifer recharge area, then the projects shall require a hydrogeological assessment for their impact on the groundwater in the critical aquifer recharge area. State-of-the-art alternative sewage disposal systems for denitrification shall be required in areas where there is the potential for nitrate loading to groundwater. Open spaces may be required overlying areas highly susceptible for contaminating groundwater resources. When water department staff determines a private well or group well poses a contamination risk to the city’s aquifer, the public works director may negotiate with the owner of the well the cost of connection to the city water system and/or sharing the cost of decommissioning the well that poses a contamination risk. Connection to the city water system is voluntary.

D.    The proposed activity must comply with the water source protection requirements of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, State Department of Health, and the Lewis County environmental health department.

E.    Critical Aquifer Recharge Area Categories. Critical aquifer recharge areas regulated under this title may be established based on general criteria described in this chapter, specifically designated due to special circumstances, or based on scientific studies and mapping efforts. Factors considered in the identification of critical aquifer recharge areas include depth to water table, presence of highly permeable soils, presence of flat terrain, and the presence of more permeable surficial geology.

1.    Category I Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas. Category I critical aquifer recharge areas are those areas that were identified in the city of Centralia 1999 Wellhead Protection Plan and include the potential for certain land use activities to adversely affect groundwater is high. Category I critical aquifer recharge areas include:

a.    Areas inside the five-year time of travel zone for Group A water system wells, calculated in accordance with the Washington State Wellhead Protection Program.

b.    Areas inside the ten-year time of travel zones in wellhead protection areas when the well draws its water from an aquifer that is at or above sea level and is overlain by permeable soils without an underlying protective impermeable layer.

c.    The city may add, reclassify or remove critical aquifer recharge areas based on additional information about areas of significant potable water supply with susceptibility to groundwater contamination or based on changes to sole source aquifers or wellhead protection areas as identified in wellhead protection programs.

2.    Category II Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas. Category II critical aquifer recharge areas are areas that provide recharge effects to aquifers that are currently or potentially will become potable water supplies and are vulnerable to contamination based on the type of land use activity. Category II critical aquifer recharge areas include:

a.    Highly Permeable Soils. The general location and characteristics of permeable soils in Lewis County is given in the Soil Survey of Lewis County by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

b.    Areas above shallow aquifers and/or surface areas which are not separated from the underlying aquifers by an impermeable layer that provides adequate protections from contamination to the aquifer(s) below. The general location of shallow aquifers in Lewis County is based upon the professional judgment of licensed hydrogeologists with knowledge of the area.

F.    Permitted Activities. The following activities are permitted in the critical aquifer recharge area and do not require submission of a hydrogeological assessment:

1.    Construction of structures and improvements, including additions, resulting in less than five percent or two thousand five hundred square feet (whichever is greater) total site impervious surface area and that does not result in a change of use or increase the use of a hazardous substance.

16.19.010 General authority.

This chapter is adopted under the authority of RCW 36.70A.050. (Ord. 2232 § 7 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.19.020 Purpose.

It is the declared policy of the city of Centralia to encourage land uses that are compatible with underlying geological conditions through the use of appropriate engineering, design and construction practices. It is also recognized that at times even the best of efforts to properly design and apply technology will not adequately reduce the risks of geological hazards. In these instances, areas of extreme geological instability are to be avoided as sites for development and placement of structures. (Ord. 2232 § 7 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.19.030 Applicability.

Geologically hazardous areas include areas determined to be susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as geologically hazardous areas:

A. Erosion hazard;

B. Landslide hazard;

C. Seismic hazard;

D. Volcanic hazard; and

E. Other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement. (Ord. 2232 § 7 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.19.035 Description of specific hazard areas.

A. Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are at least those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a moderate to severe, severe, or very severe rill and inter-rill erosion hazard.

B. Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially susceptible to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible to landslides because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Examples of these may include but are not limited to the following:

1. Those areas delineated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having severe limitation for building site development.

2. Those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable (“U” or class 3), unstable old slides (“UOS” or class 4), or unstable recent slides (“URS” or class 5).

3. Areas designated as quaternary slump, earth flows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources.

4. Areas with slopes steeper that fifteen percent and springs or groundwater seepage.

5. Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch (from ten thousand years ago to present) or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch.

6. Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials.

7. Slopes having gradients steeper than eighty percent subject to rock fall during seismic shaking.

8. Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action.

9. Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding.

10. Any area with a slope of forty percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of ten or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least ten feet of vertical relief.

C. Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are areas subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface faulting. Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage in Washington. The strength of ground shaking is primarily affected by:

1. The magnitude of the earthquake;

2. The distance from the source of an earthquake;

3. The type of thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and

4. The type of subsurface geologic structure.

D. Volcanic Hazard Areas. Volcanic hazard areas are subject to pyroclastic flows, lava flows, debris avalanche, inundation by debris flows, lahars, mudflows, or related flooding resulting from volcanic activity.

E. Settlement and soil liquefaction conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless, loose, or soft-saturated soils of low density, typically in association with a shallow groundwater table. (Ord. 2232 § 7 (Exh. A), 2009).

16.21.010 Statutory authorization.

The Legislature of the state of Washington has delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of the city of Centralia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A. To protect human life and health;

B. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.035 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas; and

F. A floodplain overlay area shall be created to protect health, safety and property in the most flood prone areas of the city.

All new lots created in the floodplain shall show that they have five thousand square feet of buildable area outside the zero-rise floodway. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.040 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the community development director’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

“Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letter A or V.

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Base flood also refers to the “one-hundred-year flood.” Designation on maps always includes the letter A or V.

“Base flood elevation” is also known and shown as BFE. The BFE means the elevation, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which flooding can be expected to occur on a frequency of once in every one hundred years, or which is subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Below-grade crawlspace” means a crawlspace meeting the requirement of 44 CFR 60.3(a)(3) and 60.3(c)(2) and (c)(5) of the NFIP regulations. The crawl area is an enclosed area below the BFE.

“Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

“Critical facilities” means facilities that are critical to the health and welfare of the population and that are especially important during and after a hazard event. Critical facilities include (but are not limited to) schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

“Elevated building” means, for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building that has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, post, piers, pilings, or columns.

“Elevation certificate” means the official form (FEMA Form 81-31) used to track development, provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with community floodplain management ordinances, and determine the proper insurance premium rate with Section B completed by community officials.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the adopted floodplain management regulations.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1.    The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

2.    The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

“Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate maps, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodplain” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. For the purposes of this chapter, the floodplain is the area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the one-hundred-year floodplain as the floodway fringe.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures that reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at CMC 16.21.180.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term “manufactured home” does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar recreational vehicles.

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

“One-hundred-year flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in magnitude in any given year. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a flood occurring once every one hundred years.

“One-hundred-year floodplain” means the area adjoining a river, stream, or watercourse covered by water in the event of a one-hundred-year flood.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

1.    Built on a single chassis;

2.    Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3.    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4.    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means anything erected, the use of which has fixed location on or in the ground, or attachment to something having fixed location on the land, including but not limited to buildings, fences, signs, and walls.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would be equal to or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement over a ten-year period. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2.    Any alterations of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Water dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations. (Ord. 2338 § 1, 2014: Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.050 Lands to which this chapter applies.

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of Centralia. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.060 Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled the Flood Insurance Study for the city of Centralia dated December 1, 1981, and any revisions thereto and the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) dated June 1, 1982, and any revisions thereto are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and the FIRM are on file at the community development department, City Hall, Centralia, Washington. The best available information for flood hazard area identification shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under CMC 16.21.140(B). Properties that are outside of the Centralia city limits but within its urban growth boundary shall meet the adopted flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and any revisions thereto by Lewis County. (Ord. 2338 § 2, 2014: Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.070 Penalties for noncompliance.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than five thousand dollars for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city of Centralia from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Each person violating any provision of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each day during which such violation continues. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.080 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.090 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.100 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Centralia, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.110 Floodplain development permit required.

A floodplain development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in CMC 16.21.060. The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes, as set forth in CMC 16.21.040, Definitions, and for all development including fill and other activities, also as set forth in CMC 16.21.040. A fee of fifty dollars shall be collected from the applicant at the time of the application. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.120 Application for floodplain development permits.

Application for a floodplain development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the community development department and may include but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

A. Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;

B. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed;

C. Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in CMC 16.21.180; and

D. Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.130 Designation of the community development director.

The community development director or designee is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.140 Duties and responsibilities of the community development director.

Duties of the community development director shall include, but not be limited to:

A. Permit Review.

1. Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;

2. Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required;

3. Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the provisions of CMC 16.21.190 are met.

B. Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with CMC 16.21.060, the community development director shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood evaluation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer CMC 16.21.180 and 16.21.190.

C. Information to Be Obtained and Maintained.

1. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or required as in subsection (B) of this section, obtain and record the actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement;

2. For all new or substantially improved floodproof structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required:

a. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level); and

b. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in CMC 16.21.120;

3. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

D. Alteration of Watercourses.

1. Notify adjacent communities and the Washington State Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration. Generally, stream relocations will only be allowed if the primary function of the action is to restore ecological function;

2. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished;

3. Alterations and relocations, including stabilization projects, shall not degrade fish habitat or the physical processes that create and maintain habitat, or cause increased flood hazard or erosion to other properties and shall be subject to the following provisions:

a. Bridges shall be used instead of culverts on all Type 1 streams, and shall meet fish habitat requirements of the State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

b. Any culverts that are used on fish-bearing streams must be arch/bottomless culverts or provide comparable fish protection, and must meet fish habitat requirements of the State Department of Fish and Wildlife Design Manual for Culverts, or more restrictive local standards.

c. Bridges or other crossings must allow for uninterrupted downstream movement of wood and gravel, must be as close to perpendicular to the stream as possible, be designed to minimize fill and to pass one-hundred-year flood flows.

d. Wherever feasible as part of an alteration, culverts that do not meet fish habitat requirements must be removed or replaced as part of the project.

e. Alteration projects shall not result in blockage of side channels. If at the time of alteration there are known barriers to fish passage into side channels, they shall be removed.

f. For any alteration of a salmonid-bearing stream whose channel is subject to migration, bioengineered (“soft”) armoring of stream banks is required. For alteration of other fish-bearing streams, soft armoring of stream banks is required wherever possible, in order to allow for woody debris recruitment, gravels for spawning and creation of side channels.

E. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter.

F. The director shall have the authority to serve a person a stop work order if an action is being undertaken in violation of this chapter. If a portion of a project is in violation of this chapter, the director may issue a stop work order for the entire project. Failure to comply with the terms of a stop work order shall result in enforcement actions described in CMC 16.21.070. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.150 Appeals.

A. The hearing examiner shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B. The hearing examiner shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the community development director in the enforcement of administration of this chapter; provided, however, such appeal must be in writing and filed within ten days of the community development director’s decision being appealed from.

C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the hearing examiner, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Lewis County superior court but such appeal must be made within twenty-one days of the decision being appealed from.

D. In passing upon such applications, the hearing examiner shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.

E. Upon consideration of the facts of subsection (D) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the hearing examiner may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

F. The community development director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.160 Conditions for variances.

A. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing CMC 16.21.150(D)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

C. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

E. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in CMC 16.21.150(D), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

F. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

G. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (A) of this section, and otherwise complies with CMC 16.21.170(A) and (B).

H. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.165 Zero-rise floodplain overlay.

The intent of this section is to preserve areas of the floodplain most prone to flooding and has no physical protection during flooding. To best protect human life, health and property, the following restrictions are placed on development within this area known as the zero-rise floodplain overlay.

A.    Permitted Uses.

1.    Single-family dwellings;

2.    Wildlife preserves;

3.    Agricultural structures and uses;

4.    Private and public parks, greenbelts and open space for active or passive recreation or enjoyment. (Note: Whenever a park or open space is created as an integral part of a subdivision or development, such park or open space shall be designated an open space/public facilities district on the official zoning map);

5.    Flood damage reduction facilities, such as levees, revetments and pumping stations;

6.    Stream bank stabilization structures, aquatic areas, and wetland restoration projects;

7.    Municipal facilities required for local service;

8.    Roads, highways and streets, both established and new;

9.    Maintenance of roads, highways and streets;

10.    Bridge piers and abutments;

11.    Boat launches and related recreation structures; and

12.    Other unlisted, similar or related uses, and criteria for determination of similarity or relatedness, as follows:

a.    Uses similar to, or related to, those listed in this subsection (A) are permitted upon a finding of the enforcing officer and/or the site plan review committee that a particular unlisted use does not conflict with the intent of this chapter or the policies of the Centralia comprehensive plan;

b.    The criteria for such finding of similarity shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

i.    That the proposed use is appropriate in this district;

ii.    That the development standards for permitted uses can be met by the proposed use; and

iii.    That the public need is served by the proposed use.

B.    Prohibited Uses. Uses other than those identified or described in subsection (A) of this section are prohibited.

C.    Filling and Grading. Development shall not reduce the effective base flood storage volume of the zero-rise floodplain overlay.

1.    Grading or other activity in the zero-rise floodplain overlay which would reduce the effective storage volume must be mitigated by creating compensatory mitigation. When development is permitted under this subsection, it shall be designed to meet the compensatory mitigation requirements in CMC 16.21.170(F).

2.    Any fills over five hundred cubic yards require a zero-rise analysis.

3.    Excavation shall not be counted as compensating for fill if such areas will be filled with water in nonstorm winter conditions.

D.    The following uses and activities are not subject to the requirements of subsection (C) of this section:

1.    Excavation and fill necessary to plant new trees or vegetation.

2.    Excavation and fill required for the construction of public detention facilities or structures, and other facilities specifically designed to reduce or mitigate flood impacts. Such facilities shall not be used to create new buildable lands.

3.    New culverts, stream crossings, and transportation projects may be permitted only if designed as balanced cut and fill projects or designed to not raise the base flood elevation.

E.    Zero-Rise Floodplain Overlay General Requirements.

1.    The provisions of this section apply to lands located within the zero-rise floodplain overlay depicted on the zero-rise floodplain overlay map, adopted May 12, 2009. Development requirements in this section shall be in addition to those of the underlying zone and, where explicitly noted, supersede the underlying zoning. If implementation of this section conflicts with the other provisions of the Centralia Municipal Code, state or federal law, the more restrictive requirement applies.

2.    Development activity must not reduce the effective storage volume of the floodplain.

3.    Development proposals, including permitted new construction or reconstruction, must not cause an increase in the one-hundred-year flood elevation.

4.    All temporary structures or materials hazardous to public health and safety must be removed or secured during the flood season, from September 30th to May 1st.

F.    Construction/Building.

1.    The designated construction period is May 1st to September 30th. Any construction preformed outside this period, during the flood season, must be permitted by the community development director dependent upon weather conditions. These renewable permits will be issued at ten-day increments throughout the flood season. There shall be no limit to the number of temporary flood season building permits issued for any single project.

2.    Agricultural Structures. The lowest floor in an agricultural structure may be located at the base flood elevation or higher; provided, that the structure is designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer in the state of Washington or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a.    A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

b.    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and

c.    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other covering or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

3.    New residential or nonresidential structures shall be constructed at least three feet above the BFE.

G.    Zero-Rise Analysis.

1.    When it is determined that a proposed project is located within a zero-rise floodplain overlay area, a zero-rise analysis shall be required to determine that no increase in base flood elevation, displacement of flood volume, or flow conveyance reduction will occur as a result of the development or fill. A zero-rise analysis may be waived at the discretion of the director if it can be found that impacts from a project will not contribute to an overall rise to the zero-rise floodplain overlay area.

2.    The zero-rise analysis shall be conducted utilizing HEC-RAS modeling methodology or other alternative methodology approved by the city. The proposed development may need to be reduced or specially engineered (such as utilizing piers or pilings) to achieve zero rise.

3.    The zero-rise analysis shall be prepared, signed, and dated by a professional engineer.

4.    When structures are elevated by piers or pilings and no fill is placed in the zero-rise floodplain overlay area, the requirement to submit a zero-rise analysis may be waived at the director’s discretion. (Ord. 2338 § 3, 2014: Ord. 2269 § 1, 2011: Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.170 General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:

A. Anchoring.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;

2. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas guidebook for additional techniques).

B. Construction Materials and Methods.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;

2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;

3. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

C. Utilities.

1. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;

2. Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway;

3. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and

4. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

D. Subdivision Proposals.

1. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

2. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;

3. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage;

4. Where base flood elevation and floodway delineation (if applicable) data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least twenty-five lots or five acres (whichever is less); and

5. Substantial improvement to existing residential structures in the zero-rise floodplain, outside the FEMA floodway, where the footprint is not increased is permitted.

E. Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source (CMC 16.21.140(B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet for residential structures and one foot for nonresidential structures above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.

F. Compensatory Mitigation (Fill in the Floodplain).

1. The amount of compensatory mitigation required within the floodplain is determined by the following:

a. Zero to five hundred cubic yards of fill: No mitigation is required.

b. Five hundred one plus cubic yards of fill: Mitigation is required which is a zero-rise or a minimum of a one-to-one ratio which means for filling and grading new excavated storage volume shall be equivalent to the flood storage capacity eliminated by filling or grading. “Equivalent” shall mean that the storage removed shall be replaced by equal live storage volume.

2. Mitigation storage may be located off site but it must be located within the city of Centralia jurisdictional boundaries unless the director approves other alternatives if it is within the same drainage areas.

3. All off-site storage must be documented by a legally binding contract that maintains the storage in perpetuity. This document must be recorded with the Lewis County assessor’s office. 

4. Fees in lieu of compensatory mitigation for any fills over five hundred one cubic yards of fill may be permitted through the city’s SEPA process. The collected funds shall be used for an established flood protection enhancement program or mitigation project as listed in the city’s adopted comprehensive floodplain management plan. The fee shall be set at ten dollars per cubic yard of fill material that will be located within the floodplain. The fees will be calculated based on the total amount of fill per the entire project. All enhancement program(s) or mitigation project(s) shall decrease flooding damage to businesses and/or residential properties within the city of Centralia or its urban growth area. 

At the discretion of the director, through the SEPA process, the mitigation fee may be reduced if mitigation techniques or a project is demonstrated to reduce flooding in the city or its urban growth area. (Ord. 2269 § 2, 2011: Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.175 Erosion and sediment control.

All new development and redevelopment that includes land disturbing activities equal to or greater than one-half acre shall comply with erosion and sediment control requirements, subsections (A)(1) through (14) of this section. All new development or redevelopment that includes land disturbing activities less than one-half acre shall comply with subsection (B) of this section. Compliance with the erosion and sediment control requirements shall be demonstrated through implementation of an approved erosion and sediment control plan. The following erosion and sediment control requirements shall be met:

A. Sites Equal to or Greater Than One-Half Acre in Size.

1. All exposed and unworked soils shall be stabilized by suitable application of BMPs. From October 1st to April 30th, no soils shall remain unstabilized for more than two days. From May 1st to September 30th, no soils shall remain unstabilized for more than seven days. Prior to leaving the site, stormwater runoff shall pass through a sediment pond or sediment trap, or other appropriate BMPs.

2. In the field, mark clearing limits and/or easements, setbacks, sensitive/critical areas and their buffers, trees and drainage courses.

3. Properties adjacent to the project site shall be protected from sediment deposition through the deployment of silt fencing or other approved appropriate BMPs.

4. Sediment ponds and traps, perimeter dikes, sediment barriers, and other BMPs intended to trap sediment on site shall be constructed as a first step in grading. These BMPs shall be functional before land disturbing activities take place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded and mulched according to the timing indicated in subsection (A)(1) of this section.

5. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. In addition, slopes shall be stabilized in accordance with the erosion and sediment control requirement indicated in subsection (A)(1) of this section.

6. Properties and waterways downstream from development sites shall be protected from erosion due to increases in volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff from the project site.

7. All temporary on-site conveyance channels shall be designed, constructed and stabilized to prevent erosion from the expected velocity of flow from a two-year, twenty-four-hour frequency storm for the developed condition. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes and downstream reaches shall be provided at all outlets of all conveyance systems.

8. All storm drain inlets made operable during construction shall be protected so that stormwater runoff shall not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.

9. The construction of underground utility lines shall be subject to the following criteria:

a. Where feasible, no more than five hundred feet of trench shall be opened at a time.

b. Where consistent with safety and space considerations, excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches.

c. Trench dewatering devices shall discharge into a sediment trap or sediment pond.

10. Wherever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved roads, provisions must be made to minimize the transport of sediment (mud) onto the paved road. If sediment is transported onto a road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day. Sediment shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping and be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner.

11. All temporary erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be removed within thirty days after final site stabilization is achieved or after temporary BMPs are no longer needed. Trapped sediment shall be removed and stabilized on site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal shall be permanently stabilized.

12. Dewatering devices shall discharge into a sediment trap or sediment pond.

13. All pollutants other than sediment that occur on site during construction shall be handled and disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of stormwater.

14. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. All maintenance and repair shall be conducted in accordance with all state and local regulations.

B. Sites Less Than One-Half Acre in Size.

1. Construction vehicle access shall be, whenever possible, limited to one route. Access points shall be stabilized with quarry spall or crushed rock to minimize the tracking of sediment onto public roads.

2. All exposed soils shall be stabilized by suitable application of BMPs, including but not limited to sod or other vegetation, plastic covering, mulching, or application of ground base on areas to be paved. All BMPs shall be selected, designed and maintained in accordance with an approved manual. From October 1st to April 30th, no soils shall remain unstabilized for more than two days. From May 1st to September 30th, no soils shall remain unstabilized for more than seven days.

3. Adjacent properties shall be protected from sediment deposition by appropriate use of vegetation buffer strips, sediment barriers or filters, dikes or mulching, or by a combination of these measures and other appropriate BMPs.

4. All erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure continued performance of their intended function.

5. As required by the director, other appropriate BMPs to mitigate the effects of increased runoff shall be applied. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.180 Specific standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in CMC 16.21.060 or 16.21.140(B), the following provisions are required:

A.    Residential Construction.

1.    New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet or more above base flood elevation (minimum FEMA standards required the lowest floor to be elevated “to or above” the BFE; however, adding an additional foot of freeboard increases safety and can reduce insurance premiums by as much as thirty percent. Adopting additional freeboard is strongly encouraged by FEMA).

2.    Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are allowed in the one-hundred-year floodplain providing they meet the design requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(a)(3) and 60.3(c)(2) and (c)(5) of the NFIP regulations. The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed through the required openings discussed in subsection (A)(2)(a) of this section. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is not recommended in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer, or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria (other types of foundations are recommended for these areas):

a.    A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

b.    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade;

c.    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

3.    Crawlspace Construction.

a.    Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE.

b.    Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in particular, must either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.

c.    The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade ((LAG), shown as D in Figure 3 of FEMA Technical Bulletin No. 11-01).

d.    The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall, must not exceed four feet (shown as L in Figure 3 of FEMA Technical Bulletin No. 11-01) at any point.

e.    The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas (see the section Guidance for Pre-Engineered Crawlspaces, on page 7 of FEMA Technical Bulletin No. 11-01). This limitation will also prevent these crawlspaces from being converted into habitable spaces.

f.    There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles, or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means.

g.    The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace. For velocities in excess of five feet per second, other foundation types should be used.

h.    Below-grade crawlspace construction in accordance with the requirements listed above will not be considered basements.

B.    Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot (see subsection (B)(4) of this section and *) or more* above the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

1.    Be floodproofed in such a manner that all areas located one foot above the base flood elevation or lower on the structure are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

2.    Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

3.    Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the community development director;

4.    Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (A)(2) of this section.

C.    Critical Facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the base floodplain. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the base floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the base floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base floodplain shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. No new construction of a critical facility will be permitted within the zero-rise floodplain overlay.

D.    Manufactured Homes.

1.    All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Flood Zones A1-A30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites:

a.    Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;

b.    In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

c.    In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

d.    In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood;

shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is two feet or more above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system in accordance with the provisions of CMC 16.21.170(A).

(Minimum FEMA standards required the lowest floor to be elevated “to or above” the BFE; however, adding an additional foot of freeboard increases safety and can reduce insurance premiums by as much as thirty percent. Adopting additional freeboard is strongly encouraged by FEMA.)

2.    Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Flood Zones A1-A30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured home provisions shall be elevated so that either:

a.    The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation; or

b.    The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and is securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system in accordance with the provisions of CMC 16.21.170(A).

(Minimum FEMA standards required the lowest floor to be elevated “to or above” the BFE; however, adding an additional foot of freeboard increases safety and can reduce insurance premiums by as much as thirty percent. Adopting additional freeboard is strongly encouraged by FEMA.)

E.    Elevation Certificate Required. Prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for any new construction or substantially improved structure in a special flood hazard area, an elevation certificate shall be required. The elevation certificate will be on the most recent form provided by the National Flood Insurance Program and shall be submitted to the community development department for approval. The certification must be prepared by a duly licensed land surveyor. In order to properly certify new construction or substantial improvements, the individual or agency must perform and document three separate elevation surveys, including:

1.    Setting a benchmark and one-hundred-year flood elevation on the construction site prior to construction;

2.    Checking the lowest floor grade at the time of foundation inspection prior to approval to pour concrete; and

3.    The as-built lowest finished floor elevation. (Ord. 2338 § 4, 2014: Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).

*Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to one foot above the base flood level will be rated as at the base flood level).


16.21.185 Recreational vehicles.

Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1—A30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM shall either:

A. Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days per calendar year; and

B. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

C. Meet the requirements of CMC 16.21.180 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.190 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in CMC 16.21.060 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;

B. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

1. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

2. Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure either (a) before the repair, reconstruction, or repair is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places shall not be included in the fifty percent;

C. If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of CMC 16.21.170 through 16.21.210;

D. Any proposed fill or construction within the floodway must meet all applicable state and federal regulations. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.200 Wetlands management.

To the maximum extent possible, avoid the short- and long-term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands, especially those activities which limit or disrupt the ability of the wetland to alleviate flooding impacts. The following process should be implemented:

A. Review proposals for development within base floodplains for their possible impacts on wetlands located within the floodplain in accordance with this chapter;

B. Ensure that development activities in or around wetlands do not negatively affect public safety, health and welfare by disrupting the wetlands’ ability to reduce flood and storm drainage;

C. Request technical assistance from the Department of Ecology in identifying wetland areas. Existing wetland map information from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) can be used in conjunction with the community’s FIRM to prepare an overlay zone indicating critical wetland areas deserving special attention. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.21.210 Encroachments.

The cumulative effect of any proposed development, where combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. (Ord. 2232 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).

16.22.070    Notice of proximity.

16.22.080    Cessation of operations.

16.22.090    Operations consistent.


16.22.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the existing gravel mines within the city’s jurisdiction. It is the declared policy of the city of Centralia to conserve and protect its valuable mineral resource lands and operations established to extract those minerals. When other land uses locate near extraction uses, those extraction uses can be subject to nuisance suits. As a result, mineral resource extraction facilities can be forced to cease operations. Future reinvestment into mineral resources operations can also be discouraged by the presence of unfriendly or noncompatible neighbors. It is the intent of the city to limit the circumstances under which mineral resource extraction operations may be deemed a nuisance and claims made against them. (Ord. 2232 § 10 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.22.040 Limitation on nuisance claims.

Any mineral resource extraction operation or any of its appurtenances shall not be or become a nuisance, private or public, by any changed conditions in or about the locality thereof after the same has been in operation for more than one year, when such operation was not a nuisance at the time the operation began; provided, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of any such operation or its appurtenances.

Any and all ordinances of the city now in effect or hereafter adopted that would make the operation of any such mineral resource extraction operation or its appurtenances a nuisance in the circumstances set forth in this code are and shall be null and void; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of any such mineral resource extraction operation or any of its appurtenances. (Ord. 2232 § 10 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.22.050 Nuisance criteria.

When a determination is made on whether a mineral resource extraction operation is a nuisance and is being run in a negligent or improper manner, as a minimum the following criteria shall be considered:

A. Endangerment of the public’s safety or health;

B. The unlawful interference with, obstruction of, or rendering dangerous for passage of a lake, river, stream, canal or basin, public park, street, alley or highway;

C. The pollution of any public well or cistern, stream, lake, canal or body of water; and

D. Dense smoke, noxious fumes, soot or cinders, in unreasonable and dangerous quantities. (Ord. 2232 § 10 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.22.070 Notice of proximity.

All plats, short plats, development permits, and building permits issued for development activities on, or within three hundred feet of, lands designated as mineral resource extraction facilities, shall contain a notice that the subject property is within or near a mineral resource extraction facility on which a variety of commercial activities may occur that are not compatible with residential development for certain periods of limited duration. (Ord. 2232 § 10 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.22.080 Cessation of operations.

Upon the cessation of mining operations, reclamation of the site will proceed in accordance with all approval conditions as well as all applicable federal, state and local regulations. (Ord. 2232 § 10 (Exh. A), 2009).


16.22.090 Operations consistent.

Mining facilities will operate in a manner consistent with the conditions of permitting and all applicable federal, state and local regulations. (Ord. 2232 § 10 (Exh. A), 2009).

18.04.040 Violations, abatement and penalties.

A.    Investigation of Complaint. Upon receipt of information or upon personal observation that a violation exists as defined in this chapter, the enforcement officer shall cause an investigation of the matter and premises involved. All entries upon premises for the purpose of this chapter shall be subject to subsection (I) of this section.

B.    Abatement Procedure. After having made a finding that a violation exists, the enforcement officer shall require the owner of the premises involved, as listed by the Lewis County assessor’s office, to abate the violation at his or her own cost and expense, in whole or in part. The enforcement officer shall give written notice to the owner describing the property involved, the condition to be corrected, and a specified reasonable time within which the owner must correct the condition, which shall not be less than fourteen days from the date of service by mail as evidenced by the postmark on the notice. In the event of an emergency condition, of which the enforcement officer shall be the sole judge, the time of compliance may be reduced to twenty-four hours. The notice must further specify:

1.    That if the owner fails to abate the violation within the specified period of time, the city shall cause the work to be performed and shall assess all or any portion of the cost thereof against the owner;

2.    That the owner may be liable for civil penalties for each day or part of day that the condition continues to exist following the notice; and

If the owner is not a resident of the city, the notice shall be served by leaving the same with the tenant in possession of the property or, if there is no such tenant, by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the property involved, and by mailing a copy thereof to the owner at his or her last known address as listed by the Lewis County assessor’s office, if any. Service by mail will be deemed complete at the end of the third full day following its deposit in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid.

D.    Failure to Comply with Notice of Violation. After the time for compliance and a notice of violation has expired, the code enforcement officer shall reinspect the premises and determine if the violation has been abated as required in the notice of violation. In the event of no action or insufficient action to abate the violation, the code enforcement officer may take any and all means necessary to enforce the applicable code, including but not limited to: issuance of civil infractions, issuance of criminal citations, commencement of civil, criminal, and equitable proceedings with the assistance of the city attorney to abate a violation and have the violation abated by the city.

E.    Liability for Costs of Abatement. The property owner shall be liable for all costs and expenses associated with a violation abatement conducted by the city of any building, structure or on the premises. In all cases where the city abates any such violation, the enforcement officer shall keep an account of all costs and expenses attending such abatement. The amount of the cost of such abatement shall be assessed against the real property upon which such cost was incurred unless such amount is previously paid. Upon certification to the Lewis County treasurer by the finance director of the city of Centralia, the treasurer shall enter the amount of such assessment upon the tax rolls against the property for the current year and the same shall become a part of the general taxes for that year to be collected at the same time and with interest at such rates and in such manner as provided for delinquent taxes, and when collected to be deposited to the credit of the general fund of the municipality. The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property which shall be of equal rank with state, county and municipal taxes. The city shall reserve the right to negotiate with property owners to recover the costs of abatement. 

F.    Liability for Continuing Violation. Every successive owner or occupant of property who neglects to abate a continuing violation upon or in the use of such property caused by a former owner is liable thereof in the same manner as the owner who created it.

Supergraphics may be permitted as a comprehensive design plan; provided, that final approval is obtained through the hearing examiner in accordance with the variance procedure described in this chapter. The exception herein is based on an effort toward creating visual harmony between the sign, the building and the site where it is located through the use of a consistent design theme.

B.    The fees prescribed in this section, except for the minimum permit fee listed in the edition of the Uniform Building Code enforced by the city, may be refunded in the event that no portion of any work authorized by the permit has been performed and; provided, that no inspections have been made.

A.    Permits issued by the building official shall become null and void if the structure of work as authorized by such permit is not commenced within one hundred twenty days from the date of the issuance of the permit, and completed within six months (one hundred eighty days) of the commencement of construction.

B.    If work has commenced and the permit becomes null and void or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, a new permit covering the proposed construction shall be obtained before proceeding with the work.

D.    Work shall be considered to have commenced and be in active progress when, in the opinion of the building official, a full complement of workmen and equipment is present at the site to diligently incorporate materials and equipment into the structure, weather permitting. This provision shall not be applicable in case of civil commotion or strike or when the building work is halted due directly to judicial injunction, order or similar process. The fact that the property or parties may be involved in litigation shall not be sufficient to constitute an exception to the period set forth in this section.

(Ord. 2049 § 1 (part), 2000: Ord. 1421 § 3E, 1979).

A) (part), 2020: Ord. 2395 § 2, 2017: Ord. 2395 § 2, 2017: Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008).


20.02.070 Optional consolidated permitting process.

A.    An application which involves two or more permits or procedures may have the processes consolidated under the highest project permit classification and procedures. The applicant shall request if they want their permit processes consolidated or if they want each permit processed individually.

B.    If a project involving two or more permits has the permits processed individually, the highest project permit classification and procedures shall be finalized before subsequent permits can be issued. The director may waive this requirement for permits not dependent on the higher classification of permit for their justification or implementation.

C.    A single open-record hearing and no more than one closed-record appeal shall be provided on a consolidated review process. The consolidated process may combine an open-record hearing on one or more permits with an open-record appeal hearing on the other permits. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008).


20.02.080 Preapplication conference.

Failure to provide all pertinent information may prevent the city from identifying all of the issues or providing the most effective preapplication conference.

F.    Lapse of Time. If a time lapse of more than six months occurs between a preapplication conference and the submission for permits, or if the director determines the scope of the project has changed significantly from the preapplication conference, a new conference may be required. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008).


20.02.085 Design review.

New buildings or existing buildings that are remodeling the outside of a structure that are located in a designated design review area are subject to meeting the design review guidelines for that specific area. The design guidelines are subject to review by the site plan review committee and other committee(s) including the planning commission for their recommendation and then approved by the director. For any development activity that requires design review, the applicant must comply with the provisions of this section before a building permit can be approved, as follows:

A.    Public Meetings. All meetings of the commission(s) shall be open to the public and are subject to the requirements of the Open Public Meetings Act, Chapter 42.30 RCW.

B.    Preapplication Conference. Before submitting a building permit application, the applicant shall attend a preapplication conference with the site plan review committee.

1.    To review preliminary sketches of the design proposal presented by the applicant;

2.    To discuss how the design guidelines pertain to the proposed development;

3.    For the site plan review committee to designate which design guidelines apply to the proposed development based primarily on the location and nature of the proposed development; and

20.24.110 Performance standards.

These standards are intended to foster the creation of an urban environment that accommodates growth and is compatible with the existing uses in the area:

A.    Lighting. On-site lighting, including parking lot lighting and illuminated signs, shall be located, directed or designed in a manner to prevent glare on adjacent properties and be designed for pedestrians. All lighting should have similar design elements throughout the downtown core.

B.    Location of Service Areas. All loading docks and other service activities shall be located away from view of any public street and be off of the alley. Exceptions to this requirement may be approved through the site plan process. If such activities are permitted adjacent to a public street, a visual screening design approved by the city shall be required.

C.    Urban Design. Designs for this area should focus on the “historic character” relating to the heritage of the early residents of the community. Colors should be medium to dark earth tones and follow the character of the neighborhood.

1.    Architectural Character and Materials.

a.    A differentiated base will provide human scale through change, contrast, and intricacy in facade form. Scaling elements such as insets and projects serve to break up flat or monotonous facades along with color and a change in materials.

b.    The climate in Centralia is such that in the summer months shade is preferred, and in the winter months protection from the rain and wind is necessary. By providing the pedestrian with a sidewalk that is enjoyable to use year-round, a pedestrian-oriented development is encouraged. Therefore, the following will be encouraged:

i.    Arcades;

ii.    Awnings and/or marquees.

2.    Entrance and Visual Access. The intent in this district is to encourage pedestrian activity between the public street/sidewalk and buildings. Sidewalks shall provide continuous, uninterrupted interest to the pedestrian by providing visual interest and/or amenities. The environment will benefit with increased pedestrian activity; this activity will only occur if opportunities are provided that make walking to a destination a preferred and an enjoyable pursuit. The use of blank building facade walls is discouraged. Therefore, all buildings in this district are subject to the following standards.

3.    Minimum First Floor Glass. The first floor elevation of a building facing a street shall not have less than forty percent glass surfaces. All first floor glass shall be nonreflective. Display windows that are three-dimensional and are at least two feet deep are permitted and may be counted toward the forty percent glass requirement.

4.    Provide at least one operable building entrance per elevation that faces a public street. Buildings that face multiple streets are only required to have one door on either street, if the facades for both streets meet the forty percent glass requirement.

a.    The maximum length of any blank wall uninterrupted by windows, doors, art or architectural detailing at the first floor level shall be forty feet.

b.    All building equipment and service areas, including on-grade and roof mechanical equipment and transformers that are readily visible from the public right-of-way, shall be screened from public view.

D.    Public Amenities and Public Art. Amenities and works of art enhance quality of life as well as visual interest. Public amenities and art encourage pedestrian activity and contribute to the experience. A cohesive, unified lighting and amenity policy will help give the district its own distinctive identity. Therefore, all projects will be required to have public amenities and art that are subject to the following standards:

1.    Sidewalks and street lamps installed in the public right-of-way shall be of the type specified in the city’s design and development standards. All parking lot lights will be required to match the city’s standards.

2.    Pedestrian amenities such as park benches will be required.

3.    Public art (which may include artists’ work integrated into the design of the building, and landscaping, sculpture, painting, murals, glass, mixed media or work by artisans) that is accessible or directly viewable to the general public shall be included in all projects.

4.    All residential projects will be required to have open space (soft or hard).

5.    Safe and efficient pedestrian circulation is a priority.

E.    All residential units shall meet the following standards:

1.    No more than seventy-five percent of the entire building square footage may be used for residential purposes. The residential use shall conform to the following performance standards:

a.    A separate entrance from the commercial use must be established for the residential use.

b.    Natural light and ventilation must be provided in each individual unit as well as the common areas such as hallways.

c.    Each unit must contain a bathroom and kitchen area within the unit.

d.    The minimum size for a studio apartment is five hundred square feet.

e.    The minimum size for a one bedroom is six hundred fifty square feet.

2.    A minimum of twenty-five percent of the entire building square footage shall be used for commercial purposes.

a.    This commercial use shall be located along the first floor building frontage.

b.    Windows and entrances shall conform to the performance standards found in subsection (C)(2), (3) and (4) of this section.

c.    Windows may not in any way be curtained or shuttered on either the interior or exterior. They must allow for observation from the outside.

F.    A modification to the urban design/performance provisions of this section may be granted by the site plan review committee after a recommendation from the historic preservation committee (if located in a historic district) and the planning commission. (Ord. 2309 § 2, 2013: Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008).


20.24.120 Design review.

Architectural and building materials review will be critical in this district to ensure that new or remodeled structures maintain an appearance which is highly compatible with adjoining commercial and residential areas in accordance with Chapters 20.02 and 20.84 CMC with recommendations from the historic preservation committee (if located in a historic district) and the planning commission. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008).

20.28.120 Performance standards.

A.    Intent. The following standards are intended to enhance the appearance of buildings and promote a high quality of design in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The intent of these standards is to:

1.    Encourage greater design compatibility with surrounding areas and establish a precedent for high quality design in areas with no established character;

2.    Achieve greater architectural variation and interest through standards for the design of roofs, exterior walls and the use of exterior finish materials;

3.    Encourage greater architectural cohesiveness and compatibility within a new development of multiple buildings; and

4.    Reduce the negative visual impact of features and site improvements such as mechanical equipment.

B.    Urban Design. It is intended that these standards apply to the primary facade of the building and to all sides of the building that may be visible from the public rights-of-way or adjacent businesses or residential neighborhoods. The design character of a building should be compatible (share similar features such as color, scale, massing, height and materials) with adjacent buildings but is encouraged to have features or characteristics that are different.

1.    Building Design. All building sides facing public streets shall incorporate a substantive use of building elements, as approved by the city to achieve a distinctive character. A recognizable base treatment of the wall consisting of thicker walls, ledges or sills using integrally textured and colored materials such as stone, masonry, or a decorative concrete or some other architectural feature that breaks up the exterior horizontal and vertical mass of the wall. Building materials such as brick, stone, concrete, tile, steel, wood, and metal are required.

2.    The climate in Centralia is such that in the summer months shade is preferred, and in the winter months protection from the rain and wind is necessary. Therefore, at least thirty percent of the horizontal length of the front walkway or facade shall be covered with awnings, porticos, arcades, or some other architectural feature or treatment which adds definition to the building openings, walkways or entrances.

3.    Building Colors. Colors for building and other elements should be medium to dark earth tones. Accent colors used to call attention to a particular feature or portion of a building, or to form a particular pattern, shall be compatible with predominant building base colors and may be incorporated using such elements as shutters, building trim and awnings and shall cover no more than five percent of a building facade.

4.    Architectural and building materials review will be critical in this district to ensure that new, reoccupied or remodeled structures maintain an appearance which is highly compatible with adjoining commercial and residential areas.

5.    New buildings and/or extensively remodeled (over fifty percent of the taxable value based on the most recent Lewis County PATS system) will be required to conform to these requirements performance standards. (Ord. 2417 § 1, 2018).

Maximum height of a building shall be forty feet or four stories. (Ord. 2354 § 4 (part), 2015).


20.29.120 Performance standards.

A.    Intent. The following standards are intended to enhance the appearance of buildings and promote a high quality of design in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The intent of these standards is to:

1.    Encourage greater design compatibility with surrounding areas and establish a precedent for high quality design in areas with no established character;

2.    Achieve greater architectural variation and interest through standards for the design of roofs, exterior walls and the use of exterior finish materials;

3.    Encourage greater architectural cohesiveness and compatibility within a new development of multiple buildings; and

4.    Reduce the negative visual impact of features and site improvements such as mechanical equipment.

B.    Urban Design. It is intended that these standards apply to the primary facade of the building and to all sides of the building that may be visible from the public rights-of-way or adjacent residential neighborhoods. The design character of a building should be compatible (share similar features such as color, scale, massing, height and materials) with adjacent buildings but is encouraged to have features or characteristics that are different.

1.    Building Design. All building sides facing public streets shall incorporate a substantive use of building elements, as approved by the city to achieve a distinctive character. A recognizable base treatment of the wall consisting of thicker walls, ledges or sills using integrally textured and colored materials such as stone, masonry, or a decorative concrete or some other architectural feature that breaks up the exterior horizontal and vertical mass of the wall. Building materials such as brick, stone, concrete, tile, steel, wood, and metal are required.

2.    The climate in Centralia is such that in the summer months shade is preferred, and in the winter months protection from the rain and wind is necessary. Therefore, at least thirty percent of the horizontal length of the front walkway or facade shall be covered with awnings, porticos, arcades, or some other architectural feature or treatment which adds definition to the building openings, walkways or entrances.

3.    Building Colors. Colors for building and other elements should be medium to dark earth tones. Accent colors used to call attention to a particular feature or portion of a building, or to form a particular pattern, shall be compatible with predominant building base colors and may be incorporated using such elements as shutters, building trim and awnings and shall cover no more than five percent of a building facade.

4.    Building materials: at least two kinds of materials distinctively different in texture or masonry pattern, at least one which is decorative block, brick or stone, with each of the required materials covering at least twenty-five percent of the exterior walls of the building. Metal siding may be used as an exterior finish material as long as the amount used does not exceed twenty-five percent of the area of any single wall, exclusive of the roof, and provided it matches or complements the building color and/or material scheme. Further, such metal siding shall be a “standing seam” type or equivalent quality, not a “corrugated” type. Architectural metals, such as bronze, brass, copper and wrought iron, may be used and may exceed the twenty-five percent area limit.

5.    Building Equipment. All building equipment and service areas, including at-grade and roof mechanical equipment and transformers, shall be substantially screened from view from public rights-of-way and other public spaces. Screening materials shall be of the same or comparable material, texture and color as the materials used on the building. Roof-mounted equipment screening shall be constructed as an encompassing monolithic unit, rather than as several individual screens. The height of the screening element shall equal or exceed the height of the structure’s tallest piece of installed equipment.

6.    Multi-Building Developments. Developments with multiple buildings shall include predominant characteristics in each building so that the buildings within the development appear to be part of a cohesive, planned area, yet are not monotonous in design. Predominant characteristics may include use of the same or similar architectural style, materials and colors.

7.    Roof Articulation. Changes in roof lines, including the use of stepped cornice parapets, a combination of flat and sloped roofs, or pitched roofs with at least two roof line elevation changes or some other architectural feature or treatment which breaks up the exterior horizontal and vertical mass of the roof.

8.    Lighting. Accent lighting on architectural and landscape features can add interest and focal points. The use of LED lighting is strongly encouraged. On-site lighting, including parking lot lighting and illuminated signs, shall be located, directed or designed in a manner to prevent glare on adjacent properties. All lighting should have similar design elements throughout the zoning district. Decorative light fixtures and up-lighting on trees and provisions for seasonal lighting are encouraged.

9.    Amenities and Art. Amenities and works of art enhance quality of life as well as visual interest. Public amenities and art encourage pedestrian activity and contribute to the experience. A cohesive, unified lighting and amenity policy will help give the district its own distinctive identity. Therefore, all projects will be required to have public amenities and art that integrated into the design of the building or landscaping that is accessible or directly viewable to the general public shall be included in all projects (examples: fountains, sculptures, murals, lighting).

10.    A modification to the performance standards may be granted by the site plan review committee, when the applicant has demonstrated that either:

a.    Site-specific, physical constraints necessitate application of the alternative standard, and such constraints will not allow a reasonable use of the property without application of such alternative standard; or

b.    The alternative standard achieves the intent to the same or greater degree and results in equivalent or greater benefits to the community. (Ord. 2354 § 4 (part), 2015).


20.29.130 Site plan review.

Architectural and building materials review will be critical in this district to ensure that new or remodeled structures maintain an appearance which is highly compatible with adjoining commercial and residential areas in accordance with Chapters 20.84 and 20.27 CMC. (Ord. 2354 § 4 (part), 2015).

20.60.020 Definitions.

Certain words and phrases as defined in this section shall govern the interpretation of this chapter:

A.    “Common open space” means a parcel or parcels of land or a combination of land and water, within the site designed and intended for the use or enjoyment of residents of a planned unit development. Common open space does not include land occupied by buildings, roads, driveways, required parking areas or the required yards for buildings or structures.

B.    “Homeowners’ association” means an incorporated, nonprofit organization operating under recorded land agreements through which:

1.    Each lot owner is automatically a member;

2.    Each lot is automatically subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for the organization’s activities, such as maintaining common property; and

3.    A charge, if unpaid, becomes a lien against the property.

C.    “Planned unit development” means any development of land approved and developed in accordance with the terms of this title, including a plat or subdivision of such land.

D.    “Residential development” means any development designed and intended for residential use regardless of the type of building in which such residence is located (i.e., conventional single-family dwellings, townhouses, duplexes, four-plexes or apartment houses). (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.030 Where permitted.

Planned unit developments may be permitted in all land use districts within the city, consistent with the development standards in CMC 20.60.060 through 20.60.140. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.040 Types of uses permitted.

A.    Specific Types Permitted. In a planned unit development, the following uses are permitted; provided, that they meet the standards and criteria established in this title:

1.    Those uses permitted as a matter of right in the underlying zone;

2.    Residential developments of all types as defined in this chapter;

3.    As a secondary use, the following neighborhood commercial uses may be permitted in a residential PUD subject to the limitations set forth in the LBD district, CMC 20.60.130, and shall be located within the interior:

a.    Specialty retail;

b.    Personal services;

c.    Other, unlisted, similar or related uses, provided the site plan review committee makes the determination that:

i.    The particular unlisted use does not conflict with the intent of this chapter or the policies of the Centralia comprehensive plan;

ii.    The use is appropriate in the development;

iii.    The development is served by the proposed use.

B.    Other or Related Uses Permitted. Other or related uses permitted include:

1.    Accessory uses specifically geared to the needs of the residents of a PUD such as motor vehicle or boat storage structures, or structures related to open space use.

A.    Zoning Requirements.

1.    The provisions of the zoning ordinance pertaining to land use of the underlying zoning district shall govern the use of land in a planned unit development.

2.    The specific setback, lot size, height limits and other dimensional requirements are waived, and the regulations for PUDs shall be those indicated in CMC 20.60.140.

B.    Platting Requirements. A PUD shall be exempt from the specific design requirements of the subdivision ordinance, except that when any parcel of land in a PUD is intended for individual ownership, sale or public dedication, the platting and procedural requirements of the subdivision ordinance and applicable state laws pertaining to the subdivision and conveyancing of land and the preparation of maps shall be followed.

C.    Public Hearing Required. Preliminary applications for PUD shall require a public hearing before the planning commission with notice thereof to be given as provided in Chapter 20.02 CMC.

D.    Preapplication Conference. For the purposes of expediting applications and reducing development costs, the city of Centralia requires a preapplication conference. This meeting will provide input from relevant department staff regarding requirements needed for a proposed project. This approach offers a forum where information can be shared about the site and staff can guide the applicant through specific requirements prior to developing a detailed site plan. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.060 Development standards—Generally.

The standards in CMC 20.60.070 through 20.60.140 shall govern the interpretation and administration of this chapter. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.070 Relationship of PUD site to adjacent areas.

The design of a planned unit development shall take into account the relation of the site to the surrounding areas. The perimeter of the PUD shall be so designed as to minimize undesirable impact of the PUD on adjacent properties and, conversely, to minimize undesirable impact of adjacent land use and development characteristics on the PUD. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.080 Site acreage.

The minimum site shall be two acres; however, the minimum area requirement may be waived by the site plan review committee. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.090 Access to public right-of-way.

The major internal street serving the PUD shall be connected to at least one major arterial, secondary arterial or collector street. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.100 Lot size.

The minimum lot size provisions of other chapters of the zoning title are waived in a planned unit development. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.110 Setback and side yard requirements.

A.    Setbacks from the exterior boundary line of the PUD area shall be comparable to or compatible with those of the existing development of adjacent properties; or if adjacent properties are undeveloped, the type of development which may reasonably be expected on such properties given the existing zoning of such properties or the projections of the comprehensive plan. In no event shall such setback be less than twenty feet.

B.    Setbacks or Side Yards Between Buildings.

1.    The standard setbacks and yard requirements between buildings may be waived in a PUD. Buildings may have common walls and, therefore, be built to the property line as in townhouse construction.

2.    Wherever buildings are separated, a minimum distance of ten feet shall be maintained between such buildings. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.120 Off-street parking.

Off-street parking shall be provided in a PUD in the same ratios for types of buildings and uses as required for the underlying zoning district, and as described in Chapter 20.72 CMC. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.130 Secondary use limitations.

A.    Commercial uses in a residential PUD are subject to site plan review procedures and shall be provided for in the original, finally approved version of the PUD application for the development within which the commercial use is to be integrated. “Original,” as is used in this subsection, refers to the PUD application as it existed at the time of its final approval by the city council.

1.    The gross floor area of the commercial use shall not exceed the product of thirty square feet multiplied by the number of dwelling units within the development.

2.    The purpose of restricting commercial development is to prevent the PUD process from being used as a vehicle for rezoning property to a commercial use which may not be related to the commercial needs of the area. Once a relatively large number of dwelling units has been completed or occupied, the need for such commercial development may be justified.

B.    Construction of at least fifty percent of the residences in the PUD must be completed before any building permits will be issued for the construction of commercial uses. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.140 Design standards.

A.    Open space requirements shall be as follows:

1.    Common Open Space. Each planned unit development shall provide not less than thirty percent of the gross land area for common open space which shall be either:

a.    Held in single ownership where such ownership assumes full responsibility for maintenance and operation; or

b.    Held in common ownership by all of the owners in the development area; or

c.    Dedicated for public use, if acceptable to the city.

2.    Common open space may be designed to provide either active or passive recreation. Common active recreational areas are maintained areas under common ownership which include, but are not limited to, pedestrian trails, pools, child play areas, improved picnic areas and recreational buildings. Common recreational facilities, such as trails, play fields, community centers, sport courts and picnic areas, should be provided. A common facility or open space should be an integral part of a PUD by being centrally located, being accessible to all occupants, and having buildings facing rather than backing onto it.

3.    Common open space may contain such complementary structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of residents of the PUD; provided, that the building coverage of such building or structure combined with the building coverage of the residential structures shall not exceed the maximum permitted by the underlying zone.

4.    Private Open Space. Three hundred square feet of private, usable open space having a minimum of fifteen feet in depth shall be provided for each ground level dwelling unit in a PUD. Such private open space is to serve as a buffer between dwelling units and common open space.

5.    Unique, Desirable and Efficient Layout. Streets, lot lines, landscaping areas, open space, building footprints and/or other features shall be arranged for maximum traffic flow efficiency and minimal impact to the existing traffic patterns and uses in the vicinity. The number of access locations shall be minimized by providing for common ingress, egress and circulation areas.

6.    Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The exterior of the planned unit development shall be highly compatible with adjacent uses. Compatibility may include, but is not limited to, restricted uses along the exterior of the development, building footprint location, open spaces, buffers, landscaping, architectural style and pedestrian/vehicular circulation linkages. The planned unit development shall be integrated into the existing community fabric.

7.    Variety of Housing Types, Styles and Affordability. Housing types within a PUD greater than or equal to ten acres should be varied to allow for a range of affordability. Although an overall architectural theme may be appropriate, there shall be a range of housing styles within a theme to avoid the monotony of identical structures.

8.    View Protection. The planned unit development should, to the greatest extent practicable, maintain existing views for adjacent properties and provide for views from within the planned unit development.

B.    Clustering is encouraged in rural and environmentally sensitive lands. Clustering shall avoid the floodplain and other environmentally sensitive areas to the greatest extent possible. Clustering shall reduce the disturbed environmentally sensitive areas resulting from development and promote more cost-effective and service-efficient use of lands.

1.    Where a cluster program is used:

a.    Clustered building lots may be only created through the subdivision or short subdivision process.

b.    Building lots should avoid the floodplain, wetlands, steep slopes and other environmentally sensitive areas to the greatest extent possible.

c.    Where practical, the majority of building sites should be arranged in a cluster or concentrated pattern to be compatible with physical site features.

2.    Consideration in the development of any cluster should include careful location of designated open space to preserve large areas of open space and/or environmentally sensitive areas.

C.    Land Area and Dwelling Unit Computations. Open space, street area, etc., are computed as follows:

1.    Street Right-of-Way. Streets in a PUD shall be computed at twenty percent of the gross land area, regardless of the amount of land actually used for streets in the final design.

2.    Density. The density of the underlying zone governs unless a density increase is granted as provided in this chapter.

3.    Density Increase. A density increase is based upon removing twenty percent of the overall site for streets and infrastructure. Density is then calculated on the remaining parcel(s) in the proposal. The base density when calculating a density bonus is the maximum possible units per acre for the underlying zone. The city council may approve an increase in the dwelling unit density; provided, that CMC 20.60.145 is met; up to:

a.    In the R:2 and R:4 zoning districts: twenty-five percent;

b.    In the R:8 and LBD districts: twenty percent;

c.    In the R:15 district: twenty percent;

d.    In the R:20 district: fifteen percent;

rounded to the nearest whole number; provided, that the environmental and recreational amenities sought by this title are met.

D.    Landscaping Required. All common open space shall be landscaped in accordance with the landscaping plan submitted by the applicant and approved by the city council. Natural landscape features which are to be preserved, such as existing trees, drainageways, rock outcropping, etc., may be accepted as part of the landscaping plan when, in the judgment of the hearing examiner, such natural features contribute to the attractiveness of the proposed development. (Ord. 2354 § 5, 2015: Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.145 Environmental and recreational amenities.

Four of the following nine amenities must be provided as part of the PUD in order to receive the density bonus as provided in CMC 20.60.140:

A.    Public Recreation Facilities. Items for consideration in meeting this criterion are to develop and equip significant recreational areas within the common open space with such features as, but not limited to, swimming pools, tennis courts, bike or pedestrian path systems, community gardens or a community building. Items in this criterion are meant to serve the general population of the development and should be aimed as an amenity for the majority. This item can only be counted twice if a second distinct and separate facility is provided beyond what is required in the minimum design standards provided in CMC 20.60.140.

B.    Preservation of Open Space and Natural, Historical and Cultural Features. Items for consideration in meeting this criterion are substantial retention of natural groundcover, brushes and trees; minimum disturbance of wildlife habitat; preservation of unique historical or cultural features; dedication to the city of land within the city’s potential park or open space areas and corridors as designated in the comprehensive plan and as shown on the land use map; and preservation of air, sunlight and scenic resources.

C.    Landscaping the Outer Edge of the On-Site Drainage Retention Facility. Landscaping of the outer edge of the on-site drainage retention facility must be in accordance with Chapter 18.10 CMC.

D.    Public Service and Facility Availability. Items for consideration in meeting this criterion are to provide significant access to a lake, river, stream or other natural water body for the general public; public schools; public parks or other public facilities and/or sites; nonexclusive bicycle and pedestrian pathway systems, public transportation and arterial access to the site; and modified site design for special needs residents to situate or cluster uses within a reasonable distance of fire and police protection, medical, shopping, church and other such amenities.

E.    Energy Efficiency. Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include preservation of solar access; south orientation with added glazing for inhabited structures; the use of landscaping and topography for windbreaks and shading; common wall constriction; transportation management strategies, including transportation demand management (TDM) strategies; the implementation of energy saving programs as successfully applied in other jurisdictions; the use of solar energy systems either passive or active for heating and/or cooling; energy conserving design of roadways and other structures; and higher insulation levels. The efficacy of all proposed energy efficiency techniques and strategies must be supported by analysis prepared by professionals with demonstrated expertise in the engineering, sustainability and/or environmental design field or be in conformance with adopted standards found in existing energy saving programs. In addition, all proposed techniques and strategies must identify anticipated energy savings as compared to conventional development.

F.    Mixed Use Development. Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include a convenience store, espresso stand, day care facility, multiple small retail spaces, beauty/barber shops and/or similar personal services. Items within this criterion are to be designed and used to meet the needs of the residents within the subdivision. To qualify for this criterion, ten percent of the net land area must be used for commercial purposes.

G.    Unique and Innovative Design. Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include cluster development, a combination of single-family and multifamily housing, public art, serpentine streets, rear alley loading and/or unique or innovative architectural designs. To qualify for this criterion, the public art must equal one percent of the total cost of development. Unique or innovative architectural design is defined as styles not typically found in the Centralia area.

H.    Child/Family Friendly Amenities. Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include tot lots, skate parks, ball fields, basketball courts and/or climbing walls. All items in this criterion are to be designed in such a way as to encourage outdoor activities for families and/or children.

I.    Cluster development designed to avoid impacts to environmentally sensitive areas to the greatest extent possible can be used as one of the four required amenities. Cluster developments shall be consistent with CMC 20.60.140(B). (Ord. 2386 § 5, 2017: Ord. 2354 § 6, 2015: Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.150 Preliminary review and approval—Application—Eligibility and procedure.

A.    Who May Apply. Any owner or group of owners of property acting jointly, or a developer authorized to act as agent for an owner or group of owners, may submit an application for PUD development.

B.    Review Procedure. All PUD applications shall be reviewed by the site plan review committee who shall submit comments and a recommendation to the planning commission.

20.60.240 Parties bound.

Once the preliminary development plan is approved, all persons and parties, their successors, heirs, or assigns, who own, have, or will have by virtue of purchase, inheritance, or assignment any interest in the real property within the proposed PUD, shall be bound by the conditions attending the approval of the development and the provisions of this title. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.60.250 Commencement of construction.

A.    Construction of the PUD project shall begin within one year from the date of the final approval of the plan.

B.    An extension of time for beginning construction may be requested in writing by the applicant, and such extension not exceeding six months may be granted by the council.

20.65.010 Intent.

In November 2012, Washington voters passed Initiative 502, which establishes precedent for the production, processing and retail sale of marijuana for recreational purposes. Pursuant to RCW Title 69 and the requirements of Chapter 314-55 WAC, the state has adopted rules establishing a statewide regulatory and licensing program for marijuana uses.

It is the intent of these regulations to ensure that such state-licensed uses are located and developed in a manner that is consistent with the desired character and standards of this community and its neighborhoods, minimizes potential incompatibilities and impacts, and protects the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Centralia. Recognizing the voter-approved right to establish certain types of marijuana businesses, it is also the intent of these regulations to provide reasonable access to mitigate the illicit marijuana market and the legal and personal risks and community impacts associated with it. (Ord. 2330 § 1 (part), 2014).


20.65.020 Applicability.

20.69.040    Permitted where.

20.69.050    Violations and complaints.

“Home occupation” means any activity conducted for financial gain or profit in a dwelling unit, and which activity is not generally or customarily characteristic of activities for which dwelling units are intended or designed; such activity is clearly incidental or secondary to the residential use of a dwelling unit; and is conducted only by persons residing in the dwelling unit. The dwelling unit must be the primary place of residence for the person conducting the home occupation. The residential character of the building is maintained and the home occupation is conducted in such a manner as to not give an outward appearance nor manifest any characteristic of a business in the ordinary meaning of the term. It does not infringe upon the right of neighboring residents to enjoy the peaceful occupancy of their homes for which the residential zone was created and primarily intended. A garage sale is not defined as a home occupation. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.69.030 General requirements.

A.    Home occupations shall occupy not more than twenty-five percent of the total floor area of the residence. In no event shall such occupancy exceed four hundred square feet.

B.    Home occupation shall not include the following: barber shop, beauty shop or real estate office.

C.    Home occupations shall not be conducted in an accessory building.

D.    Any occupation which may produce waste products of a quality or quantity not normally associated with residential use shall not qualify as a home occupation.

E.    Home occupations shall comply with all other local, state or federal regulations pertinent to the activity pursued, and the requirements or permission granted or implied by this chapter shall not be construed as an exemption from such regulations.

F.    Vehicle or appliance repair, alteration or rebuilding shall not be permitted as a home occupation.

20.90.010 When granted.

A.    If because of special circumstances applicable to subject property due to size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this title is found to deprive subject property of rights and/or privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical zone classification, the board may grant a variance in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title. Such variance may vary the literal enforcement of any standard, requirement or regulation of this title relating to the density, off-street parking or loading, but not the use provisions of the district wherein the property is located. To this end, a variance in the provisions and requirements of this title shall only be authorized if the hearing examiner finds that all the following facts and conditions exist in each case of a request for a special exception by an application for a variance:

1.    That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the subject property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same vicinity or zoning district, and that the plight of the applicant is unique and not the result of his own action;

2.    That the land or structure in question cannot be reasonably used and cannot yield a reasonable return if used only in accordance with the density requirements of this title for the district in which it is located, and that such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant possessed by the owners of other property in the same vicinity or district;

3.    That the authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare, not injurious to nearby property, nor essentially different from the provisions of the district in which it is located;

4.    That the granting of such variance will not adversely affect the comprehensive plan or studies thereof.

B.    In authorizing a variance, the board may attach such conditions regarding the location, character or other features of the proposed structures or uses as it may deem necessary to carry out the intent of this title; provided, however, that a variance so authorized shall become void after six months if no substantial construction has taken place in accordance with the plans for which such variance was authorized.

C.    No variance shall be granted by the board which allows the use of property for purposes not authorized by this title for the zoning district in which the property is located. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2147 § 27, 2005: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).

Within the districts established by this title, there exist lots and structures which were lawful prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this title. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.93.012 Nonconforming structures.

A.    Nonconforming structures shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended in a manner which would increase the nonconforming aspects of the structure.

C.    In the event a nonconforming building or structure in square footage or valuation is less than fifty percent destroyed by any cause, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the securing of a building permit within one year from the date of destruction for the restoration of the building or structure. The determination of the percentage of destruction shall rest with the building official as per the current adopted fee schedule. The determination shall be based upon the actual cost of repairing the portion of the building or structure destroyed in relation to the estimated replacement cost of the entire building or structure.

D.    Any nonconforming building or structure destroyed more than fifty percent in square footage or valuation may be reconstructed provided it meets all of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).

B.    Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, nonconforming dwelling units may be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered when at the discretion of the community development director, the following are satisfied:

1.    The proposed enlargement or structural alteration will not result in additional dwelling units on the site; and

2.    The proposed enlargement or structural alterations will generally result in improvements to the subject property and character of the surrounding area; and

3.    In the case of enlargement, the enlarged portion of the dwelling unit conforms to the dimensional requirements of the zone and is a one-time enlargement up to twenty-five percent of the total building structure. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008).


20.93.016 Nonconforming—Prior construction.

To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. “Actual construction” is defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition shall be deemed to be actual construction; provided, that work shall be carried on diligently. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).


20.93.020 Nonconforming lots of record.

A.    In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this title. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.

B.    This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided, that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 

C.    If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lots involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this title, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this title, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this title. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2147 § 29, 2005: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).

D.    The community development director shall have the discretion to extend the time limitations of subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section due to special circumstances beyond the control of the owner or occupant of the nonconforming use or nonconforming structure. Examples of special circumstances include but are not limited to disputes over insurance settlements in the case of fire or other casualty, delay in transferring title due to probate proceedings, litigation that impacts continuation of a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure, labor strikes, war, and acts of God. The decision of the community development director denying any request for an extension may be appealed to the hearing examiner. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).

20.96.030 Purpose.

The comprehensive plan is a document which guides the nature and intensity of the development in the city. An amendment to the plan is a mechanism by which the city may modify its land use, development or growth policies in order to respond to changing circumstances or needs of the city. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance as to how the comprehensive plan of the city of Centralia will be updated and amended over time. Amendments to the plan may involve changes in the written text or in the map designation adopted as part of the plan, or to supporting documents, including capital facilities plans. This chapter states the specific procedures and review criteria necessary to process comprehensive plan amendments. Plan amendments will be reviewed in accordance with the state Growth Management Act (GMA), the county-wide planning policies, applicable capital facility plans, other pertinent city plans, official population growth forecasts and key growth indicators.

C.    An amendment to the comprehensive plan may not be initiated by the planning commission or by a private party unless at least two years have elapsed since the adoption or review and reaffirmation of the element or subarea plan affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, at least three years must elapse between amendments to the land use designation of a property. These time limits do not apply if the applicant proves that there exists obvious technical error justifying the need for the amendment.

D.    The planning commission may defer review of a proposed amendment if review of the affected subarea is scheduled or reasonably likely to occur within the calendar year the proposed amendment was requested. (Ord. 2209 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 2024 § 1 (part), 1999).
