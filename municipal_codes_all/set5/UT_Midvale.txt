B.    Terms. The terms for each committee shall be three calendar years, unless otherwise specifically provided by law. The initial terms for committees may be shortened by the city council, so as to achieve a staggering of term expirations and to maintain continuity of the committee. The term of each committee member shall expire:

1.    On December 31st of the last year of the expiring term; or

2.    In the circumstance where city residency is a requirement, the date when the said member ceases to maintain his/her legal primary domicile and residence in the city.

C.    Appointment of Officers.

1.    Chairpersons. At one of its regular meetings in January of each year, each city committee of Midvale City shall nominate a member to serve as chairperson and another to serve as vice-chairperson. The chairperson and vice-chairperson shall each be appointed for a one-calendar-year term or until their successor is appointed, whichever time is longer.

2.    Secretary. Each committee shall appoint a secretary from among its members in their first meeting of each calendar year. The secretary is responsible for keeping minutes of meetings.

D.    Vacancies. Vacancies occurring on any committee shall be filled by the committee for the remainder of the unexpired term of the original appointment.

E.    Qualifications—Residency Requirement. Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, the following conditions and restrictions apply to all committees:

1.    Residency. Voting membership on any committee is limited to residents of the city and to persons eighteen years of age or older; provided, that nonresidents may be appointed, if the committee makes a finding that special expertise, unique needs of the committee or special circumstances make such a nonresident appointment to be in the public interest.

2.    Nonresidents. Nonvoting or ex-officio members may be any interested person over the age of eighteen.

3.    Term Limits. Committee members may only serve for two consecutive terms on any one committee.

4.    Six-Year Service Limit. No committee member may be appointed or re-appointed if the consecutive years of service would exceed six consecutive calendar years on any one city committee.

All existing members shall be allowed to complete the term being served at the time of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

5.    Re-Appointment after Service Break. A qualified person may be re-appointed after serving six consecutive years, plus any additional time permitted under this section, if there has been a break in service of at least one calendar year.

Within thirty days following the close of the city fiscal year, organizations receiving funding from the city shall file a detailed financial statement with the city’s administrative services director.

All committee members shall comply with all requirements of the conflict of interest ordinance in Chapter 2.16, Article VII.

Each committee will follow the city procurement and contracting protocols, policies, and laws. Each committee shall comply with the fiscal and accounting controls established by the city manager.

3.02.140 Construction-related projects.

A.    Bidding. All construction-related projects including building improvements, public works, road improvements, and special street requirements shall follow the formal bidding procedures unless stated otherwise in this chapter. Any expenditure of the city involving building improvements or public works projects shall comply with applicable provisions set forth at Section 11-39-101 et seq. of the Utah Code Annotated, as amended. Any expenditure of the city involving the construction, maintenance or improvement project of a Class B or C road or work excluded under Section 11-39-104 of the Utah Code Annotated, as amended, shall comply with applicable provisions of the State Transportation Code, including, but not limited to, Sections 72-6-108 and 72-6-109 of the Utah Code Annotated, as amended.

1.    Construction and maintenance must be made pursuant to plans, specifications, and estimates that shall be created under the supervision of the procurement officer and/or contracted consultant.

2.    Bid Security. Contracts for construction-related projects may provide for a bid security in the amount equal to at least five percent of the amount of the bid.

3.    Bonds. Construction contractors must deliver performance and payment bonds for the full contract price. The procurement officer may waive this requirement after consultation with the city attorney’s office if bonds are unnecessary for the protection of the city.

4.    Rejection. The city may reject any or all bids submitted. If, after twice advertising, no satisfactory bid is received, the city council may proceed to negotiate or make the improvement or acquisition or enter such other agreements as it deems necessary or desirable.

5.    Exempt Expenditures. The formal bidding procedures do not apply to exempt expenditures or small expenditures for construction-related projects.

6.    Withheld or Retained Payments. The city may withhold payments for poor performance or other work-related reasons. Special requirements apply to retainage, where sums are withheld as security under the contract. To implement retainage, first consult with the attorney’s office.

B.    Contractor Licensing and Requirements. When evaluating any construction-related bid, the following shall apply:

1.    To receive a contract award, a contractor must be licensed in the state of Utah at the time of submitting a bid with an appropriate license to perform the work.

2.    In accordance with Section 72-6-110 of the Utah Code Annotated, the work must be prepared and performed under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer, who must certify to the city that the project conforms to the design and construction standards currently adopted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

3.    The city may impose other licensing requirements, and, when appropriate, may regard a lack of subcontractor licensing at the time of the general contractor’s bid as a matter relating to the responsibility of the general contractor.

4.    The contractor and subcontractor, if any, must demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction that the contractor has and will maintain a drug and alcohol testing policy during the period of the contract that applies to all covered individuals employed or hired by the contractor or subcontractor and subjects the covered individuals to random testing under the drug and alcohol testing policy.

5.    The contractor and subcontractor, if any, must demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction that the contractor and subcontractor have and will maintain a program to actively recruit and/or employ veterans.

6.    The contractor and subcontractors, if any, must demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction that the contractor and subcontractor have and will maintain a job training program, such as, by way of example and not limitation, a federal, state and/or city recognized job training program.

7.    The contractor and subcontractors, if any, must demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction that the contractor and subcontractor have, and will maintain, a safety program.

C.    Construction Management and Selection. The procurement officer shall select the type of construction management that will protect and be in the best interest of the city. Factors to be considered are:

1.    The type of contract that is appropriate;

2.    The need for and availability of outside consultants;

3.    The experience, qualifications and availability of city personnel assigned to the project;

4.    Requirements related to project financing;

5.    The needs of the project; and

6.    The administrative burden imposed by the method selected.

D.    Types of Construction Management. The procurement officer may select any combination of the following construction management methods, or other methods, as appropriate:

1.    Single Prime Contractor. A single general contractor is responsible to complete an entire project in accordance with the contract and may subcontract portions of the work.

2.    Multiple Prime Contractors. A number of specialty contractors complete portions of the project pursuant to contracts with the city. The city or one of the contractors may have primary responsibility for completion or coordination of the entire project.

3.    Design-Build or Turnkey. A single contractor or team is responsible to both design and construct the project to meet performance criteria specified by the city.

4.    Construction Manager. A qualified person is responsible to coordinate the design and construction of the project and may oversee a variety of functions such as time, cost, quality and administration of change orders. The person may have some construction responsibilities as well.

5.    Sequential Design and Construction. The project’s design is substantially completed before construction begins.

6.    Phased Design and Construction or Fast Track Construction. The project’s construction begins after portions of the design are substantially complete, but design continues during the construction. (Ord. 2018-12 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


3.02.150 Contracts.

A.    The procurement officer shall select the type of contract or contract modification that is appropriate for the purchasing requirement and in the best interest of the city.

B.    Selecting Contract Type. Without limitation, the following factors may be considered in selecting a contract type:

1.    Meeting the city’s needs including quality of performance, costs, time for performance, and completion date.

2.    The type and complexity of the supply or service requirement and the stability of markets and prices.

3.    The difficulty of estimating performance costs, such as when the city is unable to develop definitive specifications, identify the contractor’s risks inherent in performing the work, or otherwise clearly establish contract requirements.

4.    The amount of risk imposed by a contract type on both parties. The degree of risk should not jeopardize any material interests of the city, or the satisfactory performance of the contract.

5.    The administrative impacts to both parties, such as administration costs, the degree to which the city must provide technical coordination during the performance of the contract, and the ability to meet any federal requirements.

6.    The effect of the choice of contract type on the amount of competition expected.

C.    Contracting Methods for Establishing Price. The procurement officer may structure a contract in any manner, but shall not issue a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract.

D.    Other Contracting Methods. Without limitation, the following describes other contracting methods available to the city:

1.    Progressive Awards. The procurement officer may award portions of a definite quantity requirement to more than one contractor as appropriate, such as when the city’s quantity needs exceed what one contractor can supply at the needed times.

2.    Multiple Awards. The procurement officer may award an indefinite quantity contract for one or more similar supplies or services to more than one bidder or offeror. Multiple awards should not be made solely for the purpose of dividing business or accommodating a user’s preference, but may be made when determined to provide a benefit to the city with respect to needs for quantity, delivery, style, price, quality, or other features.

3.    Exclusive/Nonexclusive Basis. Awards may be made on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis. Where nonexclusive, the city is not required to fill all similar needs from one contractor, but may solicit as it determines. Where a contract does not specifically state it is exclusive, it shall be deemed nonexclusive.

4.    Appropriation of Funds. Contracts extending beyond the current fiscal period shall be subject to termination for nonappropriation of funds for departments or divisions which rely on the general fund.

5.    Options to Extend Term. Contracts may include provisions to extend a contract term for specified periods at the city’s option.

E.    Modifying Contracts. Contracts relating to procurement may be modified as follows:

1.    Generally. All modifications to contracts must be in writing and signed by all parties. Modifications shall modify only the specific terms set forth, and all other contract provisions shall remain as originally entered.

2.    Modifications Not Affecting Scope, Price or Term. Any contract provisions not affecting the scope, price or term of the contract may be modified as determined appropriate by the department head and/or procurement officer, and they shall consult with the city attorney’s office as necessary.

3.    Modifications Affecting Price. The procurement officer shall review any proposed modification that significantly increases price to determine whether there has been a material change in the scope of the work originally solicited, or whether the modified price may be unreasonable.

4.    Modifications Affecting Scope of Work. The city may decrease any scope of work when in the city’s interest. The procurement officer may increase any scope of work as determined appropriate when in the city’s interest, when the modifications are reasonably related to the work originally solicited, and when the price for the increase appears reasonable.

5.    Modifications Affecting Term. Contracts may be renewed or extended by the procurement officer. Extensions cannot be used solely for the purpose of avoiding a solicitation process.

6.    Modifications to Open Contracts. In an open contract, the contractor generally agrees to provide specified supplies or services as needs arise during a fixed term, and the contract may include a total not-to-exceed price during the term. When the contract does not include a not-to-exceed price, the contract’s term can only be extended when approved in writing by the procurement officer. When the contract includes a not-to-exceed price, the procurement officer may approve an increase in price if the term is not exceeded, and the term may be extended when the not-to-exceed price is not exceeded. The procurement officer must approve in writing an increase in both term and price. When practicable, these contracts should be resolicited rather than modified to extend a term.

7.    Modifications to Small Purchase Contracts. Contracts solicited under the small expenditures procedures, as set forth in this chapter, may not be modified in excess of the maximum dollar amounts permissible for such purchases, and may not be renewed on a successive basis, unless approved by the department head and/or procurement designee.

F.    Terminating Contracts. No contract procured in connection with this chapter shall be terminated without the authorization of the city official who signed the contract or that person’s successor (the mayor is the only city official who can legally bind the city), or the procurement officer. (Ord. 2018-12 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


3.02.160 Delivery.

G.    A person who is interested in any way in the sale of any supplies, services, construction or real property is guilty of a felony if the person gives or offers to give any emolument, gratuity, contribution, loan or reward, or any promise thereof to any person acting as a procurement officer, or who in any official capacity participates in the procurement of such supplies, services, construction, or real property, whether it is given for his/her own use or for the use or benefit of any other person or organization.

This chapter shall be known as the transient room tax ordinance of Midvale City. (2011 Code.) (Ord. 2011-05 § 2 (part))


3.25.020 Purpose.

The Utah legislature has authorized municipalities to adopt an ordinance that imposes a one percent transient room tax. It is the purpose of this chapter to conform the transient room tax ordinance of the city to the requirements of the transient room tax act, as amended. (2011 Code.) (Ord. 2011-05 § 2 (part))


3.25.030 Effective date.

This chapter shall become effective immediately upon passage and first publication. (Ord. 2011-05 § 2 (part))


3.25.040 Definitions.

“Public accommodation” means a place providing temporary sleeping accommodations to the public and includes a motel, hotel, motor court, inn, bed and breakfast establishment, condominium, and resort home.

“Rents” includes rents and timeshare fees or dues.

“Transient” means a person who occupies a public accommodation for thirty consecutive days or less. (2011 Code.) (Ord. 2011-05 § 2 (part))


3.25.050 Transient room tax.

A.    Imposed. From and after the effective date hereof, there is levied and imposed, and there shall be collected and paid, a transient room tax on the rents charged to transients occupying public accommodations within the city’s corporate limits in an amount that is equal to one percent of the rents charged.

B.    State Provisions Adopted. The provisions of Title 59, Chapter 12 Utah Code Annotated, as amended, are hereby adopted as follows:

1.    Except as hereinafter provided, and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of the transient room tax act, all of the provisions of Title 59, Chapter 12 Utah Code Annotated, as amended, and in force and effect on the effective date hereof, insofar as they relate to sales and use taxes, excepting Sections 59-12-101 and 59-12-352 of the Utah Code Annotated, are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein.

2.     Wherever, and to the extent that in Title 59, Chapter 12 Utah Code Annotated, as amended, the state of Utah is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of the city, or other name pursuant to a name change, shall be substituted therefor. Nothing in subsection (B) of this section shall be deemed to require substitution of the name of the city for that of the state in any section when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city rather than by or against the state tax commission in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.

3.     If a license has been issued to a person or entity (a “transient facility”) offering public accommodations for rent to transients under Section 59-12-106 of the Utah Code Annotated, an additional license shall not be required by reason of this chapter.

4.     There shall be excluded from the rents charged (by which the transient room tax is measured) the amount of any sales or similar transient room tax imposed by the state or Salt Lake County upon the transient facility or the transient in connection with such rental transaction.

C.    Collection. Pursuant to Section 59-12-354 of the Utah Code Annotated, the city is empowered to either directly collect the tax imposed hereunder or to contract with the state tax commission to collect such tax. Notwithstanding subsection (B) of this section, or any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, however, the city reserves the right, exercisable at its option, to itself collect the tax imposed hereunder if at any time (including, without limitation, during or for the time period of January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2000) the state tax commission fails or refuses to collect any such tax arising at any time from or after one second after twelve o’clock (12:00:01) a.m. on January 1, 2000. In availing itself of such right to directly collect such tax, the city shall comply with Section 59-12-354 of the Utah Code Annotated, and any and all other applicable legal requirements. To the extent, if any, that the city elects to directly collect such tax, the city shall be entitled to impose penalties and interest for nonpayment or underpayment of such tax in amounts equal to the penalties and interest rates authorized for the state tax commission under Sections 59-1-401 and 59-1-402 of the Utah Code Annotated. (1999 Code.) (Ord. 2011-05 § 2 (part))


3.25.060 Revenue use.

All revenues generated by the transient room tax and penalties, if any, hereunder may be used by the city for general fund purposes. (2011 Code.) (Ord. 2011-05 § 2 (part))


3.25.070 Severability.

It is the intention of the city council that each separate provision of this chapter shall be deemed independent of all other provisions herein. Accordingly, if any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter, including, but not limited to, any exemption, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.

F.    Debt service costs, consisting of repayment of principal, payment of interest, and trustee fees and administrative expenses for all applicable bond, certificate or securities issues or loans of whatever nature or kind.

Article I. General Provisions, Purposes


5.12.010 Title.

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the sexually oriented business licensing ordinance. (Ord. 10/6/2009O-18 § 2 (part), 2009)


5.12.020 Purpose.

It is the purpose and object of this chapter that the city establish reasonable and uniform regulations governing the licensing and manner of operations of sexually oriented businesses and their employees in the city. This chapter shall be construed to protect the governmental interests recognized by this chapter in a manner consistent with constitutional protections provided by the United States and Utah Constitutions. The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the regulation and licensing of sexually oriented businesses within the city in a manner which will protect the property values of surrounding businesses and neighborhoods, and residents from the potential adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, while providing to those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses the opportunity to do so. Sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution. Licensing of sexually oriented businesses and employees is a legitimate and reasonable means of ensuring that operators and employees of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and operators do not knowingly allow their businesses to be used for illegal sexual activity or solicitation. There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing neighboring businesses and surrounding residential areas, causing increased crime and downgrading of property values. The purpose of this chapter is to control the adverse effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and guests of city, protect the citizens from increased crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values and character of the surrounding neighborhoods, and deter the spread of urban blight. (Ord. 10/6/2009O-18 § 2 (part), 2009)


5.12.030 Application of provisions.

This chapter imposes regulatory standards and license requirements on certain business activities, which are characterized as sexually oriented businesses. It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Utah, but to impose content-neutral regulations which address the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses. Nothing in this chapter is intended to supersede or nullify any other related ordinances including, but not limited to, the Municipal Code of Midvale City, Utah. (Ord. 10/6/2009O-18 § 2 (part), 2009)


5.12.040 Obscenity.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to permit or allow the showing or display of any material which is contrary to the provisions of the City of Midvale Municipal Code, or other applicable federal or state statutes prohibiting obscenity. (Ord. 10/6/2009O-18 § 2 (part), 2009)

5.15.010 Purpose.   

Residents of the city have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their residences as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The city has a substantial interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The city also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.

There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the city and its citizens and the effect of the regulations in this chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of city officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by door-to-door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door-to-door solicitation, the city adopts this chapter to promote the city’s substantial interests in: 

A.    Respecting citizen’s decisions regarding privacy in their residences; 

B.    Protecting persons from criminal conduct; 

C.    Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious belief, political position, or charitable activities; and

D.    Permitting truthful and non-misleading door-to-door solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce. 

The city finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the city interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated. (Ord. 10/03/2006O-17 § 1 (part), 2006)


5.15.020 No other city license or approval required. 

A.    Registered solicitors and persons exempt from registration need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or registration from the city to engage in door-to-door solicitation.

B.    Any business licensed by the city under another city ordinance that uses employees, independent contractors, or agents for door-to-door solicitation in an effort to provide any tangible or intangible benefit to the business, shall be required to have such solicitors obtain a certificate unless otherwise exempt from registration. 

C.    Those responsible persons or entities associated with registered solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or registration from the city, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed place of business in the city.

D.    Nothing herein is intended to interfere with or supplant any other requirement of federal, state, or other local government law regarding any license, permit, or certificate that a registered solicitor is otherwise required to have or maintain. (Ord. 10/03/2006O-17 § 1 (part), 2006)

Article I. Declaration of Findings and Intent—Scope of Ordinance


5.52.010 Findings regarding rights-of-way.

A.    The city of Midvale finds that the rights-of-way within the city:

1.    Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the city;

2.    Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;

3.    Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-being of the city and its citizens; and

4.    Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities construction, placement, relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way.

B.    Finding Regarding Compensation. The city finds the right to occupy portions of the rights-of-way for limited times for the business of providing telecommunications services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to the city and its taxpayers, and, therefore, the taxpayers of the city should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights-of-way.

C.    Finding Regarding Local Concern. The city finds that while telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.

D.    Finding Regarding Promotion of Telecommunications Services. The city finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational and community services.

E.    Findings Regarding Franchise Standards. The city finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:

1.    Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;

2.    Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the rights-of-way to serve the public;

3.    Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;

4.    Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;

5.    Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the city infrastructure;

6.    Protects the public’s investment in improvements in the rights-of-way; and

7.    Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Act”) (P.L. No. 96-104).

F.    Power to Manage Rights-of-Way. The city adopts the telecommunications ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable, compensation for the use of rights-of-way by providers as expressly set forth by Section 253 of the Act. (Ord. 2014-08 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 10/28/2003O-12 (part), 2003: Ord. 10-17-2000E (part), 2000)

A.    Cable TV. This chapter shall not apply to cable television operators otherwise regulated by Chapter 5.50 (the “cable television ordinance”).

B.    Wireless Services. This chapter shall not apply to personal wireless service facilities.

C.    Provisions Applicable to Excluded Providers.

(Ord. 2014-08 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 10/28/2003O-12 (part), 2003: Ord. 10-17-2000E (part), 2000)

Article III. Franchise Required


5.52.050 Nonexclusive franchise.

The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, operation, use and maintenance of systems in the city’s rights-of-way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the city and provider. (Ord. 2014-08 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 10/28/2003O-12 (part), 2003: Ord. 10-17-2000E (part), 2000)


5.52.060 Every provider must obtain.

Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services using the rights-of-way, and every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise. (Ord. 2014-08 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 10/28/2003O-12 (part), 2003: Ord. 10-17-2000E (part), 2000)


5.52.070 Nature of grant.

A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the property of others, including the city’s property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise. (Ord. 2014-08 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 10/28/2003O-12 (part), 2003: Ord. 10-17-2000E (part), 2000)


5.52.080 Current providers.

Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

Article I. Declaration of Findings and Intent—Scope of Ordinance


5.54.010 Findings regarding right-of-way.

A.    Midvale City finds that the right-of-way within the city:

1.    Is critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the city;

2.    Is intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;

3.    Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-being of the city and its citizens; and

4.    Is a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities construction, placement, relocation, and maintenance in the right-of-way.

B.    Finding Regarding Compensation. The city finds the right to occupy portions of the right-of-way for limited times for the business of providing personal wireless services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to the city and its taxpayers, and, therefore, the taxpayers of the city should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the right-of-way.

C.    Finding Regarding Local Concern. The city finds that while wireless communication facilities are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve right-of-way, municipal franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.

D.    Finding Regarding Promotion of Wireless Communication Services. The city finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of wireless communication services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational and community services.

E.    Findings Regarding Franchise Standards. The city finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:

1.    Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;

2.    Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the right-of-way to serve the public;

3.    Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of right-of-way;

4.    Protects the police powers and right-of-way management authority of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;

5.    Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the city’s infrastructure;

6.    Protects the public’s investment in improvements in the right-of-way; and

7.    Ensures that no barriers to entry of providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Act”) (P.L. No. 96-104).

F.    Power to Manage Right-of-way. The city adopts the wireless communication services ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to its power to manage the right-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of right-of-way by providers as expressly set forth by Section 253 of the Act. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.020 Scope of ordinance.

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall provide the basic local framework for providers of wireless services and systems that require the use of the right-of-way, including providers of both the system and service, those providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system but who only provide services. The ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the city prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whether operating with or without a wireless franchise as set forth in Section 5.54.770. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.030 Excluded activity.

A.    Cable TV. This chapter shall not apply to cable television operators otherwise regulated by Chapter 5.50 or to open video system providers otherwise regulated.

B.    Wireline Services. This chapter shall not apply to wireline service facilities or providers otherwise regulated by Chapter 5.52.

C.    Provisions Applicable. All of the requirements imposed by this chapter through the exercise of the city’s police power and not preempted by other law shall be applicable. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))

Article III. Wireless Franchise Required


5.54.050 Nonexclusive wireless franchise.

The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive wireless franchises governing the installation, construction, operation, use and maintenance of wireless systems in the city’s right-of-way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The wireless franchise is granted through a wireless franchise agreement entered into between the city and provider. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.060 Every provider must obtain.

Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, every provider must obtain a wireless franchise prior to constructing, operating, leasing, or subleasing a wireless communication system or providing wireless services using the right-of-way. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide wireless services over the same system, must also obtain a wireless franchise. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.070 Nature of grant.

A wireless franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the right-of-way. A wireless franchise is only the right to occupy right-of-way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purpose and for the limited period stated in the wireless franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased. A wireless franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the property of others, including the city’s property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.080 Current providers.

Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting without a wireless franchise on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall request issuance of a wireless franchise from the city within ninety days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. If such request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a wireless franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.54.680. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.090 Nature of wireless franchise.

The wireless franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive wireless franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its wireless system on, over and under the right-of-way in order to provide wireless services. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.100 Regulatory approval needed.

Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the wireless franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


5.54.110 Term.

No wireless franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less than ten years or greater than fifteen years. Each wireless franchise shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))

Article IV. Compensation and Other Payments


5.54.120 Compensation.

As fair and reasonable compensation for any wireless franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the following obligations:

A.    Application Fees. A provider shall pay the following application fees for the respective applications in accordance with Section 54-21-503 of the Utah Code Annotated, as amended:

5.54.330 Visual impact.

A.    Minimization. All WCFs shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public to the greatest extent reasonably possible within one hundred feet of a site and consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF.

B.    Integration. WCFs and equipment shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site. Such WCFs shall be designed to be compatible with the built environment, through matching and complementary existing structures and specific design considerations such as architectural designs, height, scale, color and texture or be consistent with other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant vicinity.

C.    Decorative Poles. If a provider must displace a decorative pole to collocate a small wireless facility, the replacement pole must reasonably conform to the design aesthetic of the displaced decorative pole.

D.    Design/Historic Districts. Subject to Section 54-21-208 of the Utah Code Annotated, a provider’s design and location must be approved prior to collocating a new small wireless facility or installing a new utility pole in the following zones:

5.54.340 Stealth design/technology.

A.    Stealth design is required and concealment techniques must be appropriate given the proposed location, design, visual environment, and nearby uses, structures, and natural features. Stealth design shall be designed and constructed to substantially conform to surrounding utility poles, light poles, or other similar support structures in the right-of-way so the WCF is visually unobtrusive.

B.    Stealth design requires screening WCFs in order to reduce visual impact. The provider must screen all substantial portions of the facility from view. Such screening should match the color and be of similar finish as the attached support structure.

C.    WCFs and their associated equipment must be installed flush with any pole or support structure (including antennas mounted directly above the top of an existing pole or support structure) and the furthest point of an antenna, or equipment may not extend beyond eighteen inches from the pole or support structure except if the pole owner requires use of a standoff to comply with federal, state, or local rules, regulations, or laws. Any required standoff may not defeat stealth design and concealment techniques.

D.    Stealth and concealment techniques do not include incorporating faux-tree designs of a kind that are not native to the state. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part). Formerly 5.54.320)

5.54.370 Site design flexibility.

Individual WCF sites vary in the location of adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography and other local variables. By mandating certain design standards, there may result a project that could have been less intrusive if the location of the various elements of the project could have been placed in more appropriate locations within the right-of-way. Therefore, the WCF and supporting equipment shall be installed so as to best camouflage, disguise them, or conceal them, to make the WCF more closely compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure, to minimize the visual impact of the WCF, supporting equipment, and equipment enclosures on neighboring properties, or to interfere less with pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, and other users of the right-of-way upon approval by the city. (Ord. 2018-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2018-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part). Formerly 5.54.350)

5.    A detailed explanation justifying why the WCF is required in the right-of-way. The applicant must demonstrate in a clear and complete written alternative sites analysis that multiple alternatives in the geographic range of the service coverage objectives of the applicant were considered. This includes, but is not limited to, explaining why the installation of permitted small wireless facilities and the installation of a macrocell on private property are insufficient. This analysis must include a factually detailed and meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative candidate and the proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the applicant rejected the alternative candidate.

a.    A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection may not include less than five alternative sites unless the applicant provides a factually detailed rationale for why it could not identify at least five potentially available sites.

b.    For purposes of disqualifying potential alternative sites for the failure to meet the applicant’s service coverage objectives the applicant must provide (i) a description of its objective, whether it be to close a gap or address a deficiency in coverage, capacity, frequency or technology; (ii) detailed technical maps or other exhibits with clear and concise RF data to illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative; and (iii) a description of why the alternative does not meet the objective;

6.    An explanation that demonstrates the following:

a.    A significant gap in the coverage, capacity, or technologies of the service network exists such that users are frequently unable to connect to the service network, or are regularly unable to maintain a connection, or are unable to achieve reliable wireless coverage within a building;

b.    The gap can only be filled through an exception to one or more of the standards herein;

c.    The exception is narrowly tailored to fill the service gap such that WCF conforms to these standards to the greatest extent possible; and

d.    The manner in which the applicant proposes to fill the significant gap in coverage, capacity, or technologies of the service network is the least intrusive means on the values that these regulations seek to protect;

7.    A noise study for the proposed WCF and all associated equipment. The application shall provide manufacturer’s specifications for all noise-generating equipment, such as air conditioning units and backup generators, and a depiction of the equipment location in relation to adjoining properties. The applicant shall provide a noise study prepared and sealed by a qualified Utah-licensed professional engineer that demonstrates that the WCF will comply with intent and goals of this chapter;

8.    The proposed WCF may not be closer than the average distance between existing poles that are within one mile of the proposed site. If no poles exist within one mile of proposed pole site, then all subsequently placed poles must be at least two hundred fifty feet from each other;

9.    The design of a new pole must comply with the requirements of this chapter and be approved by the city;

10.    An affidavit certifying that the applicant has posted or mailed notices to property owners within three hundred feet of the proposed WCF site.

a.    This requirement is not required to be met at the time application is submitted, but is required to be completed prior to approval of a permit.

b.    The notice shall provide the following information:

i.    The applicant’s name and contact information.

ii.    A phone number for the provider by which an individual could request additional information.

iii.    A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type, height and width of the proposed tower, separation distances, adjacent roadways, photo simulations, a depiction of all proposed transmission equipment, setbacks from property lines and the nearest buildings, and elevation drawings or renderings of the proposed tower and any other structures.

iv.    Language that states:

If you have any public safety concerns or comments regarding the aesthetics or placement of this wireless communication facility, please submit your written comments within fourteen days to:

Article VII. Construction and Technical Requirements


5.54.470 General requirement.

A.    No provider shall receive a wireless franchise unless it agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this chapter governing construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any other reasonable requirements or procedures specified by the city or the wireless franchise.

B.    No antenna, small wireless facility, or other equipment may be added to city poles without a pole attachment agreement with the city. No antenna, small wireless facility, or other equipment may be added to city poles that are not able to structurally accommodate the antenna, small wireless facility, or other equipment.

C.    WCFs that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this chapter shall be allowed to continue their use as they presently exist. This code does not make lawful any WCF that is not fully approved on the date the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted and those pending WCFs will be required to meet the requirements of this code.

D.    The applicant must comply with all federal (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act), state, and local laws and requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, participating in Blue Stakes of Utah as required by Sections 54-8a-2 through 54-8a-13 of the Utah Code Annotated, as amended.

E.    In the installation of any WCF within the right-of-way, care must be taken to install in such a way that does not damage, interfere with, or disturb any other utility or entity that may already be located in the area. Any damage done to another utility’s or entity’s property must be immediately reported to both the city and the owner of the damaged property, and must be promptly repaired by the provider, with the provider being responsible for all costs of repair, including any extra charges that may be assessed for emergency repairs. Failure to notify the city and the damaged property owner will result in revocation of the franchise agreement. When approving the location for a WCF, the location of utilities or other entities’ property, or the need for the location of other utilities, within the right-of-way must be considered before approval to locate the WCF will be given in order to ensure those other services to the public are not disrupted.

F.    All WCFs and utility poles must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate WCFs and utility poles including, but not limited to, RF emissions. If such standards and regulations are changed, and if WCF equipment is added either through collocation or replacement, then the owners of the WCFs and utility poles governed by this chapter shall bring such WCFs and utility poles into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring WCFs and utility poles into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF or utility pole at the owner’s expense.

G.    A WCF or utility pole must comply with the all applicable codes and applicable standards.

H.    All structures shall be constructed and installed to manufacturer’s specifications, and constructed to withstand a minimum one-hundred-mile-per-hour (mph) wind, or the minimum wind speed as required by the city’s currently adopted Uniform Building Code, as amended.

I.    The following maintenance requirements apply to WCFs, as applicable:

1.    All landscaping shall be maintained at all times and shall be promptly replaced if not successful.

2.    All WCF sites shall be kept clean, neat, and free of litter.

3.    A WCF shall be kept clean and painted in good condition at all times. Rusting, dirty, or peeling facilities are prohibited.

An owner or person having charge, care, custody or control of an animal or animals creating a nuisance, as defined in this title, shall be guilty of allowing a nuisance in violation of this title and subject to the penalties provided herein. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.015 Public nuisance animal.

“Nuisance” means any animal or animals that unreasonably annoy humans, endanger the life or health of other animals or humans, or substantially interfere with humans’, other than their owner’s, enjoyment of life or property.

The term “public nuisance animal” shall mean and include, but is not limited to, any animal that:

A.    Is repeatedly found at large;

B.    Damages the property of anyone other than its owner;

C.    Repeatedly molests or intimidates neighbors, pedestrians or passersby by lunging at fences, chasing, or acting aggressively towards such person, unless provoked by such person;

D.    Chases vehicles;

E.    Makes disturbing noises, including, but not limited to, continued and repeated howling, barking, whining, or other noise which causes unreasonable annoyance, disturbance, or discomfort to neighbors or others;

F.    Causes fouling of the air by odors and thereby creates unreasonable annoyance or discomfort to neighbors or others;

G.    Causes unsanitary conditions in enclosures or surroundings where the animal is kept or harbored;

H.    Defecates on any public or private property without the consent of the owner of such property, unless the handler of such animal shall have in his or her possession the instruments to clean up after his or her animal and shall remove the animal’s feces to a proper trash receptacle;

I.    Is offensive or dangerous to the public health, safety, or welfare by virtue of the number and/or types of animals kept or harbored;

J.    Attacks people or other animals, whether such attack results in actual physical harm to the person or animal to whom or at which the attack is directed;

K.    Has been found by a court or by any other commission or board lawfully established under Utah law to be a public nuisance under any other provision of Utah law;

L.    Cannot be restrained by normal restraints, such as standard leashes, standard chains, or muzzles; or

M.    Cannot be effectively controlled by its owner or handler.

The fact, or evidence of the fact, that the factors alleged to have caused the animal to be a nuisance are inherent and/or natural behavior for such animal, or the actions of the owner or animal are otherwise legal, shall not negate or excuse a charge of nuisance. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.020 Animal nuisance abatement.

A.    Authority. If the director has reasonable grounds to believe that an animal constitutes a public nuisance animal, as defined herein, and that such nuisance necessitates immediate abatement, he/she may issue an abatement order, by mail or posting, giving the animal owner or keeper seven days to abate the animal nuisance. If the animal nuisance is not abated within seven days after delivery of the abatement notice, an animal control officer may seize the animal pending delivery of an order concerning the disposition of the animal by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each day that an owner or keeper allows an animal nuisance to persist beyond seven days following delivery of an abatement notice will constitute a separate violation of this title.

B.    Costs. If the court determines that the animal in question is not a nuisance and/or need not be abated for the public health and safety, the division shall cause the animal to be returned to the owner or handler forthwith, and shall assume the responsibility for the costs incurred while the animal is under the care and keeping of the division. If the court determines that the animal in question constitutes a public nuisance, the owner or handler shall be liable to the division for the cost incurred by the division for the animal’s care and keeping while the matter is before the courts, and for the cost of destroying the animal. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.030 Animal bites—Reporting requirements.

A.    Time Limit for Reporting. Persons who obtain knowledge that an animal has bitten another animal or a human shall report the facts to the division within twenty-four hours of the bite, regardless of whether the biting animal is of a species subject to rabies.

B.    Medical Personnel. A physician, or other medical personnel, who renders professional treatment to a person bitten by an animal shall report that fact to the division and the health department within twenty-four hours of his/her first professional attendance. Such report shall include the name, sex and address of the person bitten as well as the type and location of the bite. If known, the person making the report shall give the name and address of the owner of the animal that inflicted the bite, and any other facts that may assist the division in ascertaining the immunization status of the animal.

C.    Veterinarians. A veterinarian or other person who treats an animal bitten, injured or mauled by another animal shall report that fact to the division. The report shall contain the name and address of the owner of the injured animal, the name and address of the owner, if known, of the animal which caused the injury, and a description of the animal, if known, which caused the injury, and the location of the incident.

D.    Violation. Any person not conforming with the requirements of this section shall be in violation of this title. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.040 Fierce, dangerous or vicious animals.

It is a violation of this title for an owner or handler of a dangerous or vicious animal to allow or permit said animal to go or be off his/her premises unless such animal is under secure restraint and muzzled and/or confined so as to prevent it from injuring any person, property, or other animal. The owner of any dangerous or vicious animal shall microchip the animal and register the microchip number with the division. Every animal so vicious and dangerous that it cannot be controlled by reasonable restraints, and every dangerous and vicious animal not effectively controlled by its owner or person having charge, care or control of such animal, so that it shall not injure any person or property, is a hazard to public safety, and the director may take the same action in regards to such animal as is permitted in Section 6.24.020, or may seek a court order for destruction of or muzzling of the animal. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.050 Control and fencing of livestock.

A.    At Large. It is unlawful for an owner or handler of livestock to allow, either negligently or wilfully, the same to run at large in an area where such is not permitted by any law or regulation.

C.    Fencing. In areas where livestock are not permitted to run at large, the owner or handler of livestock shall construct adequate fencing and shall maintain said fencing to prevent livestock animals’ escape from the owner’s or handler’s premises.

D.    Adequate Fencing Defined. For the purposes of this section, “adequate fencing” means, at a minimum, mesh, barbed wire, chainlink, rail, or post fencing; or metal fence panels.

E.    Stallions. Because of the unusual hazards presented by stallions, such animals shall be confined in a fenced enclosure with a minimum fence height of eight feet.

F.    Failure to Comply. Failure by an owner or handler to erect and maintain the fencing required by this section, thus permitting the escape of an animal, or injury to persons, property or other domesticated animals, shall be a violation of this title. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))

A.    Harboring Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person, except an animal welfare society incorporated or otherwise qualified to do business within Utah and licensed under this title, to harbor or keep any lost or stray pet, unless otherwise allowed by Utah law. A person who assumes and maintains control of a lost or stray pet longer than twenty-four hours, without notifying the division of the presence and location of said animal, shall be presumed to have violated this section.

B.    Unlawful Confinement. It shall be unlawful for any person to take an animal, without the permission of the owner or handler thereof, and/or to confine an animal in a place unknown to the owner or handler; or to conceal an animal’s whereabouts from the owner or handler thereof. The offense described herein is committed irrespective of the period of time of such unlawful confinement or concealment. This section shall not apply to animal control officers legally taking an animal in an emergency or under protection from its owner or handler. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.070 Dogs or ferrets running at large—Owner liability.

It is unlawful for the owner or handler of any dog or ferret to allow such dog or ferret at any time to run at large. The owner or handler of a dog or ferret shall be liable in damages for injury committed by such dog or ferret and it shall not be necessary in any action brought thereof to allege or prove that such dog or ferret was of a vicious or mischievous disposition or that the owner or keeper thereof knew that it was vicious or mischievous. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.080 Animal trespass.

6.24.090 Staking dogs improperly.

6.24.100 Female dogs in heat.

Any owner or person having charge, care, custody or control of any female dog in heat shall, in addition to restraining such dog from running at large, cause such dog to be constantly confined in a building or other structure so as to prevent it from attracting by scent or coming into contact with other dogs and creating a nuisance. (Ord. 2018-06 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 2012-12 § 2 (Exh. A) (part))


6.24.110 Dogs prohibited in designated areas.

A.    Restaurants and Similar Places. It is unlawful for any person to take or permit any animal, whether loose or on a leash or in arms, in or about any establishment or place of business where food or food products are sold or displayed, or served, including, but not limited to, restaurants, grocery stores, meat markets and fruit or vegetable stores.

C.    Staking in Public Place. It is unlawful for any person to chain, stake out or tether any animal in a public place unless the owner or handler of the animal is continually present and the animal is properly restrained so that the animal poses no threat of contact with a person engaged in a normal and expected activity.

D.    Public Parks. It is unlawful for any person to take or permit any unrestrained animal in any public park located within the city. Any animal in a public park must be continually kept on a leash, not over eight feet in length, which is of sufficient strength to ensure that the animal’s owner or handler shall at all times have absolute control over the animal. The director may grant exceptions to this subsection for a licensed animal exhibition.

E.    Exceptions. This section shall not apply to dogs provided for in Section 6.16.090(B), or when the director of the health department adopts rules and regulations, which are subsequently ratified by the city council, which set forth the times and places where the dog or dogs may be allowed without compromising the health and safety of humans, causing a nuisance, or damaging property.

7.01.020 Purpose. 

The city council finds that the enforcement of the Midvale Municipal Code and applicable state codes is an important public activity. Code enforcement is vital to the protection of the public’s health, safety, welfare, and quality of life. The city council recognizes that code enforcement is effective only when done quickly and fairly. The city council further finds that an enforcement system that allows a combination of judicial and administrative remedies is effective in correcting violations. (Ord. 2020-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 8/27/2002A (part), 2002)


7.01.030 Scope.

The provisions of this title may be applied to all violations of the Midvale Municipal Code or applicable state codes which occur within Midvale City limits and such territory outside Midvale City limits over which the city has jurisdiction or control by virtue of any constitutional provision or law. This title establishes an additional remedy that may be used by the city to achieve compliance with applicable codes. (Ord. 2020-01 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 8/27/2002A (part), 2002)

7.01.050 Criminal prosecution right.

The city shall have sole discretion in deciding whether to file a civil or criminal judicial case or pursue an administrative enforcement action for the violation of any of its ordinances or applicable code requirements. The enactment of this title shall not be construed to limit the city’s right to prosecute any violation as a criminal offense.

The city council hereby declares that it would have adopted this title and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, clauses, phrases, portions, or provisions be declared invalid or unconstitutional.

7.01.080 Civil liability. 

By establishing performance standards or by establishing obligations to act, it is the intent of the city council that Midvale City employees and officers are exercising discretionary authority in pursuit of an essential governmental function and that any such standards or obligations shall not be construed as creating a ministerial duty for purposes of tort liability.

a.    Special Inspector. All building permit applicants for construction of a single family use residential unit must retain, at their sole cost, a special inspector as defined in Section 8.10.030(BB). Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Midvale City building official, the special inspector will submit a certification that final surface cover depth meets or exceeds the CUP approved depth.

b.    Materials Management. All materials from excavations deeper than the CUP approved depth (“restricted materials”) shall be subject to a materials management plan. All materials will be segregated to prevent mixing with the surface cover; except that any excavated materials that the special inspector certifies do not contain contaminants at levels above EPA action levels will not be considered “restricted materials.” All restricted materials will be (i) placed back in the excavation (where feasible) at or below the applicable depth, compacted as appropriate, and the surface cover replaced at an elevation not less than the original CUP approved depth; (ii) relocated to areas within the Bingham Junction North property intended for uses other than residential; or (iii) disposed of in an RCRA Subtitle D landfill.

4.    Excavation Activities Requiring Building Permit after Initial Home Construction. For all activities after initial home construction that require a building permit and involve excavations below the CUP approved depth, a materials management plan and a special inspector will be required as part of the Midvale City building permit and inspection process. The special inspector will oversee implementation of the materials management plan.

a.    Special Inspector. All building permit applicants for construction work within residential areas will be required to retain, at their sole cost, a special inspector as defined in Section 8.10.030(BB). The special inspector will certify to the city that the applicable institutional controls set forth in this chapter (as then applicable to such property and activity) have been followed in connection with such construction activities.

b.    Materials Management. All materials from excavations deeper than the CUP approved depth (“restricted materials”) will be segregated to prevent mixing with the surface cover; except that any excavated materials that the special inspector certifies do not contain contaminants at levels above EPA action levels will not be considered “restricted materials.” All restricted materials will be (i) placed back in the excavation (where feasible) at or below the applicable depth, compacted as appropriate, and the surface cover replaced at an elevation not less than the original CUP approved depth; (ii) relocated to areas within the Bingham Junction North property intended for uses other than residential; or (iii) disposed of in an RCRA Subtitle D landfill.

5.    Activities Not Subject to Building Permit Requirement.

a.    In single family use areas subject to this section, where the CUP approved depth is equal to or greater than four feet, no additional institutional controls will apply with respect to excavations not otherwise subject to building permits.

b.    In single family use areas subject to this section, where the CUP approved depth is less than four feet, the following additional controls will apply to excavations exceeding the CUP approved depth where no building permit is otherwise required:

i.    All property owners must submit a landscape and, if applicable, grading plan to the POA prior to beginning any landscaping or grading activities. The POA shall ensure that the CUP approved depth is maintained and preserved through the landscaping process.

ii.    All grading activities which result in a final area with less than the CUP approved depth are prohibited. Importation of surface cover will be required to achieve desired landscaping elevations. (Ord. 6/26/2007O-8 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)


8.10.170 Bingham Junction and Jordan Bluffs—Clean utility corridors.

Except as provided in Section 8.10.070, the cover and materials management provisions of this chapter in Sections 8.10.060, 8.10.100, 8.10.130, and 8.10.150 do not apply to clean utility corridors installed, approved, and maintained in accordance with this section. Clean utility corridors shall include those utility corridors located within the boundaries of Bingham Junction or Jordan Bluffs and identified in Figure N that meet the requirements in this section. Figure N shall be a compilation of as-built drawings (as amended from time to time and adopted by reference) identifying the location of installed clean utility corridors mapped using GPS coordinates. Said information shall also be included as a layer on the city’s GIS-based utility maps. In order to qualify as a clean utility corridor, the corridor must meet the following requirements:

A.    The utility corridor location and utilities (wet or dry) to be located in the corridor must be approved by the city and incorporated into Figure N;

B.    The utility corridor is to be excavated to meet engineering requirements with excavated materials to meet materials management provisions of this chapter, including without limitation the requirement to place a geotextile demarcation material (or equivalent) to mark the bottom of the clean utility corridor excavation;

C.    The vertical edges of the clean utility corridor will be marked by using brightly colored geotextile material (or equivalent);

D.    All bedding and backfill materials put back into the trench must meet the definition of clean fill in Section 8.10.030(H), including a requirement to have a clean fill barrier of at least twenty-four inches in single-family use areas; and

E.    Any subsequent maintenance and/or repairs to utilities within clean corridors will be conducted to meet these requirements, that is:

1.    Materials removed from the clean utility corridor will be managed as clean fill;

2.    Materials placed back into the clean utility corridor must qualify as clean fill;

3.    Vertical and horizontal demarcation materials will be preserved and replaced with new material as necessary; and

4.    Reasonable care will be taken to ensure that cross-contamination will not occur along vertical clean utility corridor wall boundaries. (Ord. 5/6/2008O-4, 2008)

Article I. Purpose and Methods


8.11.003 Statutory authorization.

The Legislature of the State of Utah has in Utah Code Annotated Section 10-3-701 et seq. delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.007 Findings of fact.

A.    Whereas the flood hazard areas of Midvale City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and

B.    Whereas these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage; and

C.    Whereas the city of Midvale automatically adopts effective FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps and effective FEMA Flood Insurance Studies;

D.    Now, therefore, the city of Midvale, Utah, does ordain as follows. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.010 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A.    Protect human life and health;

B.    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C.    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E.    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;

F.    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and

G.    Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.020 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:

A.    Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;

B.    Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C.    Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;

D.    Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;

E.    Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)

Article II. Definitions


8.11.030 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Alluvial fan flooding” means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.

“Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

“Area of special flood hazard” is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Critical feature” means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

“Development” means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

“Elevated building” means a nonbasement building (1) built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (2) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, “elevated building” also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, “elevated building” also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of “elevated building,” even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

“Existing construction” means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. “Existing construction” may also be referred to as “existing structures.”

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1.    The overflow of inland or tidal waters.

2.    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood Insurance Study” is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map.

“Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”).

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain management regulations” means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

“Flood protection system” means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a “special flood hazard” and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

“Floodway (regulatory floodway)” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure that is:

1.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2.    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3.    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

4.    Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either:

a.    By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or

b.    Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Levee” means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

“Manufactured home” means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

“New construction” means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

1.    Built on a single chassis;

2.    Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;

3.    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4.    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Start of construction” (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or

2.    Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“Variance” is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)

8.11.100 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)

Article IV. Administration


8.11.110 Designation of the floodplain administrator.

The city manager or designee is hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.120 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.

Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

B.    Review permit application to determine whether proposed building sites, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.

C.    Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of this chapter.

D.    Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.

E.    Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.

F.    Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating agency which is State NFIP Coordinator, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

G.    Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.

H.    When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 8.11.050, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article V of this chapter.

I.    When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

J.    Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE and AH on the community’s FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot; provided, that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (Conditional Letter of Map Revision). (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.130 Permit procedures.

A.    Application for a development permit shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required:

1.    Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;

2.    Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;

3.    A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of Section 8.11.160(B);

4.    Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;

5.    Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with Section 8.11.120(A);

B.    Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors:

1.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

2.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

3.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

4.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

5.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

6.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;

7.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;

8.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

9.    The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;

10.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.140 Variance procedures.

A.    The appeal board as established by the community shall hear and render judgement on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B.    The appeal board shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C.    Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.

D.    The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

E.    Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.

F.    Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 8.11.130(B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

G.    Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (Section 8.11.010).

H.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

I.    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

J.    Prerequisites for Granting Variances.

1.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

2.    Variances shall only be issued upon:

a.    Showing a good and sufficient cause;

b.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

c.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

3.    Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Article V. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction


8.11.150 General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:

A.    All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;

B.    All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;

C.    All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;

D.    All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;

E.    All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;

F.    New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and

G.    On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.160 Specific standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) Section 8.11.050, (ii) Section 8.11.120(H), or (iii) Section 8.11.170(C), the following provisions are required:

A.    Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Section 8.11.130(A)(1) is satisfied.

B.    Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.

C.    Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

1.    A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

2.    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

3.    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

D.    Manufactured Homes.

1.    Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

2.    Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites (a) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (b) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

3.    Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection (D) be elevated so that either:

a.    The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or

b.    The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

E.    Recreational Vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM either:

1.    Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days;

2.    Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or

3.    Meet the permit requirements of Section 8.11.130(A), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes” in subsection (D) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.170 Standards for subdivision proposals.

A.    All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with Sections 8.11.007, 8.11.010 and 8.11.020.

B.    All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of Section 8.11.060; Section 8.11.130; and the provisions of Article V of this chapter.

C.    Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 8.11.050 or 8.11.120(H).

D.    All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

E.    All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.180 Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones).

Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 8.11.050 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:

A.    All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

B.    All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures:

1.    Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

2.    Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or effects of buoyancy.

3.    A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 8.11.130(A)(1), are satisfied.

4.    Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)


8.11.190 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 8.11.050 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:

A.    Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B.    If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V of this chapter.

C.    Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations; provided, that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)

Article VI. Penalties for Noncompliance


8.11.200 Penalties for noncompliance.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than two thousand five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than ten days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city of Midvale from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 9/22/2009O-17 (part), 2009)

D.    Sells or otherwise transfers or encumbers property without disclosing a lien, security interest, adverse claim, or other legal impediment to the enjoyment of the property, whether the lien, security interest, claim, or impediment is or is not valid or is or is not a matter of official record; or

E.    Promises performance that is likely to affect the judgment of another in the transaction, which performance the actor does not intend to perform or knows will not be provided, however, that failure to perform the promise in issue without other evidence of intent or knowledge is not sufficient proof that the actor did not intend to perform or knew the promise would not be performed. (Prior code § 13-640-1(E))


9.60.030 Obtain.

"Obtain" means, in relation to property, to bring about a transfer of possession or of some other legally recognized interest in property, whether to the obtainer or another; in relation to labor or services, to secure performance thereof; and in relation to a trade secret, to make any facsimile, replica, photograph, or other reproduction.

a.    Every pawnbroker or person who has or operates a business dealing in or collecting used or secondhand merchandise or personal property, and every agent, employee or representative of the pawnbroker or person who fails to comply with the requirements of subdivision 4 shall be presumed to have bought, received or obtained the property knowing it to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained. This presumption may be rebutted by proof.

b.    When in a prosecution under this section it appears from the evidence that the defendant was a pawnbroker or a person who has or operates a business dealing in or collecting used or secondhand merchandise or personal property, or was an agent, employee or representative of a pawnbroker or person, that the defendant bought, received, concealed or withheld the property without requiring the person from whom he bought, received, or obtained the property to sign the certificate required in this subdivision 4 and in the event the transaction involves an amount exceeding twenty dollars, also place his legible print, preferably the right thumb, on the certificate, then the burden shall be upon the defendant to show that the property bought, received or obtained was not stolen.

2.    A notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing to forfeit the owner’s interest in the lot or parts of the lot shall be given by personal delivery of a written notice of the time, place and purpose of the meeting of the governing body or by mailing a copy of the notice to the last-known address of the owner or owners.

3.    In the absence of an ability to make personal delivery of the written notice to the owner or owners, a notice of the hearing to forfeit rights to such lot or portions of lot shall be published at least once in a newspaper having general circulation in the county.

B.    The mayor shall communicate his decision to both the recorder/clerk and the cemetery superintendent.

13.06.010 Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect, preserve, and maintain existing and potential public drinking water sources in order to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare of city residents and visitors. The intent of this chapter is to establish and designate drinking water source protection zones and groundwater recharge areas for all sources of public drinking water within city boundaries and jurisdiction. This chapter establishes criteria for regulating the storage, handling, use or production of hazardous or toxic substances within identified areas where groundwater is, or could be affected by the potential contaminant source. This shall be accomplished by the designation and regulation of property uses and conditions that may be maintained within such zones or areas. The provisions of this chapter shall apply only to developments that take place after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or to existing property uses that change their character to such an extent as to constitute a new use and different use. The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to the handling, movement and storage of potentially hazardous materials.

The degree of protection afforded by this chapter is considered adequate for regulatory purposes. This chapter does not ensure that public drinking water sources will not be subject to accidental or intentional contamination, nor does it create liability on the part of the city, or an officer or employee thereof, for any damages to the public water supplies from reliance on this chapter nor any administrative order lawfully made thereunder.

A notice to cease or an exemption issued under this chapter shall not relieve the owner of the obligation to comply with any other applicable federal, state, regional or local regulations, rule, ordinance or requirement, nor shall said notice or exemption relieve any owner of any liability for violation of such regulations, rules, ordinances, or requirements.

Developments that do not lie within either the primary or secondary recharge area may proceed with the development plan processing requirements of the city of Midvale. (Ord. 2/17/98 § 5, 1998)


13.06.050 Management strategies and performance standards.

A.    Toxic, Hazardous, and Other Materials Handling Regulations. The general classes of substances to be regulated under this chapter shall be those set forth in the “Generic Regulated Substances List” which is presented as Section 13.06.110. The regulated substances shall include those set forth in the most current lists, as amended from time to time, entitled Identification and Listing of Hazardous Materials (40 CFR Part 261, Subpart D) and List of Extremely Hazardous Substances (40 CFR Part 355, Appendix A and B) and which are in a form that they are, all or in part, capable of entering the groundwater.

The use and storage of regulated substances in designated protection zones and recharge areas shall be allowed; provided, that the quantities of these substances do not exceed the “Reportable Quantity” for each Regulated Substance, as designated in 40 CFR 302 (pursuant to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act). An applicant may be exempted from the provisions of this section; provided, that he or she demonstrates to the department and to the Utah Division of Drinking Water Quality that the regulated substances pose no hazard to groundwater.

B.    Storage Containers. All regulated substances shall be stored in suitable containers to reduce the chance for the substances to be accidentally introduced into the environment. These storage containers shall be product-tight and, except where provided elsewhere in this chapter, shall be provided with a means to control spillage (primary containment) and to contain or drain off spillage and fire-protection water discharged in the storage area (secondary containment).

Storage containers which are stored outside must be covered or mounted to prevent the accumulation of rain or other water on the top of the container, or the degradation of the top, sides or bottom of the container, in a manner that would lead to the reduction of the integrity of the container. Defective storage containers shall be removed from service for repair or disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal standards.

C.    Secondary Containment. Where secondary containment is required, it shall be constructed of a material of sufficient structural integrity and composition to contain the required capacity of liquids and not be structurally weakened as a result of contact with the discharge of the regulated substance to be contained. The material shall be free of cracks, joints, gaps, or other imperfections which would allow leakage through the containment material.

The secondary containment system shall have sufficient capacity to contain (a) ten percent of the volume of all containers and one hundred percent of the volume of the largest single container, whichever is greater, plus (b) the design flow rate of the automatic fire extinguishing system (for twenty minutes) for the area or room in which the storage is located. If the storage area and/or containment area are open to rainfall, the secondary containment system must also accommodate the volume of a twenty-four-hour rainfall as determined by a twenty-five-year storm frequency. Liquid that accumulates in the secondary containment system shall be removed in as timely a manner as necessary to prevent overflow of the system. Nonhazardous liquids may be drained in accordance with applicable local regulations. If the collected material is a hazardous waste under Title 40 Part 261 of the Code of Federal Regulations, it must be managed as a hazardous waste in accordance with all applicable requirements of Parts 262 through 266 of that regulation.

Vacuum suction devices, absorbent scavenger materials or other devices approved by the department shall be present on-site or available to facilitate the removal or further containment of spilled regulated substances. Devices or materials shall be available in sufficient magnitude so as to at least control and collect the total quantity of regulated substances that the containment system is designed to contain. Emergency containers shall be present and of such capacity as to hold the total quantity of regulated substances plus absorbent material.

D.    Regulated Substances Emergency Management Plan. An emergency plan shall be prepared and filed with the department, the fire department, the police department, and the PWS indicating the procedures that will be followed in the event of the release of a regulated substance so as to control and collect all such spilled material in such a manner as to prevent it from discharging into any storm or sanitary drains or the ground. Facilities which have had, or appear to have had, unauthorized discharges to soil or groundwater shall be required by the department to submit a regulated substances management plan for the facility. The written plan will be used to demonstrate to the department that the facility owner or operator understands the procedures and has the proper equipment to handle regulated substances within the guidelines of this chapter. The plan should not be implemented without the approval of the department.

E.    Reporting of Spills. Any spill of a regulated substance in excess of the nonaggregate quantity thresholds established by the List of Hazardous Waste (40 CFR Part 261, Subpart D), 40 CFR Appendix VIII—Hazardous Constituents and EPA Designation Reportable Quantities and Notification Requirements for Hazardous Substances under CERCLA (40 CFR 302, effective July 3, 1986) shall be reported by telephone to the city and designated water utility within one hour of discovery of the spill. Cleanup shall commence immediately upon discovery of the spill. A full written report shall be submitted to the city within fifteen days of discovery of the spill.

F.    Best Management Practices. Under the provisions of this chapter, all potential contamination sources within the city’s boundaries shall incorporate and utilize best management practices (BMPs) in their operations. BMPs that reduce the potential for spills and leaks at a site to occur and enter groundwater shall be construed within the context of this chapter to include, but not be limited to, structural and nonstructural practices, conservation practices, and operation and maintenance procedures as specified by the Utah Department of Drinking Water Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

G.    Underground Storage Tanks. Installation of any new underground storage tanks used to store regulated substances for either residential or nonresidential activities in recharge areas and protection zones designated under Sections 13.06.030(B) and 13.06.040 shall require a secondary containment system for the tank and associated underground piping, and an automatic leak detection system.

A permit from “Division of Environmental Remediation and Response” shall be required for the removal or closure of USTs. The permit shall require that leaking tanks be pumped dry and removed from the ground by a state-licensed company. If removal of the UST(s) is not feasible, the lines shall be disconnected and capped and the tank shall be filled with an inert substance such as washed sand.

Best management practices implementation is required for all underground storage tanks.

H.    Septic Tank Systems. No person shall place, maintain, or operate on-site sewage disposal from a septic tank within the primary recharge area, zone 1, zone 2, or within three hundred feet of any public street in which a public sewer is laid. Septic systems in zones 3 and 4 shall comply with the Utah State Department of Health Care of Waste Disposal Regulations, Parts IV and V.

Nonresidential activities which have septic tank systems shall have installed a four-inch-diameter vertical pipe with a locked cap or locked top in the top of the septic tank. This monitoring pipe shall be located in a manner which will permit ready access by department personnel to extract representative samples to check for improper/unauthorized disposal of regulated substances.

A septic holding tank that does not discharge into the soil would be preferred. The contents of a septic holding tank are removed, and can be treated or disposed of at an appropriate facility.

I.    Sewage Collection, Transmission and Disposal. No person shall discharge treated or untreated sewage in any area not specifically designated for that purpose by the department. The owner or operators of any wastewater treatment plant, sanitary sewer, force main, gravity sewer, or lateral shall notify the department within twenty-four hours of discovering a break that may or does result in the leakage of sewage. Emergency telephone numbers will be prominently displayed on all sewage lift stations within zones 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the primary recharging area.

All leaking sewage collection and transmission pipes shall be repaired or replaced. New sewage collection and transmission pipes shall be installed according to acceptable construction standards and shall have routine inspections during and after construction.

No person shall place, maintain, or operate a wastewater treatment plant within zones 1 or 2.

J.    General Stormwater Management. All future stormwater management systems to be constructed and implemented for facilities within the protection zones and recharge areas shall be permitted in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

The discharge of stormwater into drainage wells or open sinkholes shall be prohibited without some form of treatment. This treatment shall be applied to at least the first one-half-inch of runoff from the area tributary to the well or open sinkhole.

The clean water and stormwater regulations require municipalities and industries to identify, monitor, and limit urban runoff that may enter rivers, thus potentially affecting groundwater quality.

K.    Deicing Salt Storage and Application. Deicing salt shall be stored on an impermeable pad and shall be covered. Deicing salt application shall use best management practices and shall evaluate substitute products and technologies.

L.    Landfills. Expansion or creation of new landfills is prohibited in the primary recharge area and zones 1 and 2. Existing landfills in the primary recharge area or in protection zone 1 shall be required to comply with the provisions of UAC R315-301-1 through 301-5. Landfills shall develop and implement a landfill monitoring program. The monitoring shall include the vadose zone and groundwater. If the monitoring detects contamination, the following corrective measures may be required:

1.    Cover the landfill with suitable low-permeability materials and minimize the application of supplemental water to reduce infiltration of moisture.

2.    Install groundwater containment and treatment actions, additional monitoring, and erosion controls as required.

M.    Environmental Quality Monitoring. Facilities which have had, or appear to have had, unauthorized releases to soil or groundwater shall be required by the department to monitor soil and groundwater in and adjacent to the facility. At the request of the department, the facility will submit a monitoring plan for department review. The plan shall be implemented with the approval of the department. Facilities that undergo closure may be required to monitor soil and groundwater in and adjacent to the facility subject to closure. All costs associated with the closing and monitoring of the site will be paid for by the operator of the facility. (Ord. 2/17/98 § 6, 1998)


13.06.060 Exclusions and exemptions.

A.    Inspections. The department shall be granted the right, under this chapter, to enforce the provisions of this chapter for the city of Midvale. An authorized officer of the city of Midvale or the PWS has the right to conduct inspections of facilities to determine compliance with this chapter. The authorized officer or the PWS shall inform the department and other city entities, as deemed appropriate, of the results of the inspection and whether violations were noted. The authorized officer of the city of Midvale shall enforce the provisions of this chapter without regard to whether the wells within the city of Midvale boundaries are owned by the city of Midvale. Noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter is a violation. If the facility is not complying with the requirements of this chapter, penalties (e.g., citations of noncompliance, orders to cease operations or administrative penalties) may be assessed. This chapter regulates businesses within the protection zones and primary and secondary recharge areas within the city.

B.    Notice of Violations. Whenever it is determined that there is a violation of this chapter or the regulations promulgated pursuant hereto, the notice of violation shall:

1.    Be in writing;

2.    Be dated and signed by the authorized city agent that made the inspection or determined the violation;

3.    Specify the violation or violations;

4.    Provide a specific date that the violations will be corrected by;

5.    State that if the violation is not corrected by a specific date a hearing may be requested before the department.

If a potential contaminant source (PCS) is out of compliance with the provisions of this chapter, but does not pose an immediate threat to public health, then a written warning of violation may be issued within thirty days. The person has the opportunity to show a good faith effort to correct an unintentional violation within a reasonable amount of time. A cease and desist order shall be issued by the department if the PCS is found not to employ BMPs and there is an immediate threat to public health and safety or if the violation is not corrected within the time frame specified in a written warning previously issued to the PCS. In the event that the PCS fails to comply with a cease and desist order within the specified time period, the department has the authority to file a request for the department to initiate proceedings for issuance of penalties and other relief as necessary.

Any PCS or person found in violation of any provisions of this chapter will be served with a written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time frame for compliance. Violations of the provisions of this chapter constitute a misdemeanor, punishable as provided by law. In the event of a spill, leak or discharge of a regulated substance, the department, if he/she deems the activity to pose a real and present danger of contaminating surface or groundwater which would normally enter the public water supply, has the authority under this chapter to cause cessation of said activity or use of regulated substance, require administrative controls to mitigate said danger and/or cause the provision of pollution control and abatement activities. A facility is in violation of this chapter if use of regulated substances in a protection zone or primary or secondary recharge area exceeds twenty gallons or one hundred sixty pounds at any time. The total use of regulated substances may not exceed fifty gallons or four hundred pounds in any twelve-month period.

C.    Appeals. Persons cited under the enforcement provisions of subsections (A) and (B) of this section shall be afforded a process for appealing the ruling of the department. If the appeal pertains to a written warning of violation requesting the PCS to correct an unintentional violation in a reasonable amount of time, the PCS can submit to the department a written statement demonstrating compliance or explaining a process for coming into compliance. This written response is required no later than thirty days from the date of issuance of the warning.

If the appeal pertains to a cease and desist order issued by the department, the PCS can submit a written appeal response no later than 10 days from the date of issuance of the order. The written appeal shall contain:

1.    Documentation of compliance; or

2.    Response to specific violations cited in the cease and desist order and the remedial actions planned to bring the facility into compliance; and

3.    Schedule for compliance.

Upon receipt of the written appeal, the department shall be required to review the appeal within ten days of its receipt and respond to the PCS. If the department determines that the written response from the PCS is adequate and noncompliance issues are addressed, the PCS will be notified by mail and no further action is required. If the department determines that the appeals response is inadequate, the PCS may request a hearing before the department. This hearing shall be held within thirty days of receiving the cease and desist order and shall remain in effect until the hearing is conducted. (Ord. 2/17/98 § 8, 1998)

C.    To provide for the administration of a continuing program of backflow prevention which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all drinking water systems. (Ord. 2-9-93 § 1.1, 1993)


13.12.020 Definitions.

“Approved backflow assembly” means accepted by the Utah Department of Health Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation and the city water department as meeting an applicable specification or as suitable for the proposed use.

“Auxiliary water supply” means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor’s public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor’s public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or “used waters” or “industrial fluids.” These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have authority for sanitary control.

“Backflow” means the reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back-pressure or back-siphonage.

“Backflow prevention assembly” means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow. Specifications for backflow prevention assemblies are contained within the Utah Plumbing Code, Chapter 10 (Appendix J), and the Cross-Connection Control Program for Utah.

“Back-pressure” means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under pressure into the feeding distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source(s) other than the intended source.

“Back-siphonage” means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source(s) other than the intended source, caused by the reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system.

“Contamination” means a degradation of the quality of the potable water supply by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials.

“Cross-connection” means any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures which may allow nonpotable water or industrial fluids or other material of questionable quality to come in contact with potable water inside a distribution system. This would include any temporary connections, such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over devices or sliding multiport tubes or other plumbing arrangements.

“Cross-connection containment” means the installation of an approved backflow assembly at the water service connection to any customer’s premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer’s water system; or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer’s water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection (isolation).

“Cross-connection controlled” means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.

“Water purveyor” means the person designated to be in charge of the water department of the city, who is invested with the cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 2-9-93 § 2, 1993)


13.12.030 Role of city outlined.

A.    The city shall be responsible for the protection of its drinking water distribution system from foreseeable conditions leading to the possible contamination or pollution of the drinking water system due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants into the drinking water supply.

B.    Drinking water system surveys/inspections of the consumer’s water distribution system(s) shall be conducted or caused to be conducted by individuals representing the city. Survey records shall indicate compliance with the aforementioned health and safety standards. Such records will be reasonably maintained by the city.

C.    The city shall notify in writing, all consumers of the need for the periodic system survey to insure compliance with existing applicable minimum health and safety standards.

D.    Selection of an approved backflow prevention assembly for containment control required at the service entrance shall be determined from the results of the system survey. (Ord. 2-9-93 § 1.2, 1993)


13.12.040 Consumer’s responsibilities.

It shall be the responsibility of the consumer:

A.    To become aware of and to comply with this chapter as a condition of water supply.

B.    To purchase, install, test and maintain the backflow prevention device/assembly required to comply with this chapter. (Ord. 2-9-93 § 1.3, 1993)


13.12.050 Responsibilities of city water department.

A.    The city water department shall be responsible to enforce the applicable sections of the plumbing code which begins at the point of service (downstream or consumer side of the meter) and continues throughout the developed length of the consumer’s water system.

B.    The city water department will review all plans to ensure the unprotected cross-connections are not an integral part of the consumer’s water system. If a cross-connection cannot be eliminated, it must be protected by the installation of an air gap or an approved backflow prevention device/assembly. In accordance with the Utah Plumbing Code.

C.    Water vacating the drinking water supply must do so via approved air gap or approved mechanical backflow prevention assembly, properly installed and in accordance with the Utah Plumbing Code. (Ord. 2-9-93 § 1.4, 1993)


13.12.060 Certified backflow assembly technicians, surveyors or repairpersons—Responsibilities.

A.    Whether employed by the consumer or a utility to survey, test, repair or maintain backflow prevention assemblies the certified backflow technicians, surveyors or repairpersons will have the following responsibilities:

1.    Insuring acceptable testing equipment and procedures are used for testing, repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies;

2.    Make reports of such testing and/or repair to the consumer, water purveyor, and the Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation on forms approved for such use by the Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation, and within the time frames prescribed by the Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation;

3.    The report shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used;

4.    Insuring replacement parts are equal in quality to parts originally supplied by the manufacturer of the assembly being repaired;

5.    Not changing the design, material or operational characteristics of the assembly during testing, repair or maintenance;

9.    The certified technician conducting the test must tag each double check valve, pressure vacuum breaker, reduced pressure backflow assembly and high hazard air gap, showing the serial number, date tested and by whom. The technician’s license number must also be on this tag.

B.    In the case of a consumer requiring a commercially available technician, any certified technician is authorized to make the test and report the results of that test to the consumer, water purveyor and the Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation. If such a commercially tested assembly is in need of repair, the Plumbers Law of Utah, Section 58A-2-4-(3), requires a licensed plumber make the actual repair. (Ord. 2-9-93 § 1.5, 1993)


13.12.070 General requirements.

A.    No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws, regulations, codes, and this chapter. Service of water to a consumer found to be in violation of this chapter shall be discontinued by the water purveyor after due process to include a written notification of a violation and a reasonable time period to allow for voluntary compliance, if:

1.    A backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter for control of backflow and cross-connections is not installed, tested, and maintained; or

2.    If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or by-passed; or

3.    If an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises; or

4.    If the periodic system survey/inspection has not been conducted.

B.    Water service shall not be restored until all violations or defects of state laws, regulations, codes or this chapter are corrected.

C.    The customer’s system(s) shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city water department to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this chapter exist and to audit the results of the required survey (Section 13.12.030(B)).

D.    Whenever the water purveyor deems a service connection’s water usage contributes a hazard to the water supply, an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line of the identified consumer’s water system, at or near the property line, or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line.

E.    The type of protective assembly required under subsection D of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists at the point of cross-connection (whether direct or indirect), applicable to local and state requirements or resulting from the required survey.

F.    All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purposes described in this chapter at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection G of this section be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water purveyor is satisfied that they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location or, requires more than minimum maintenance or, when the water purveyor in his sole discretion determines that the operation or maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting city and state requirements.

G.    It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified surveys/inspections, and operational tests made at least once per year at the consumer’s expense. If, in his opinion, the water purveyor deems a hazard to exist he may require surveys/inspections and tests at a more frequent interval, it shall be the duty of the water purveyor to see that these tests are made according to the standards set forth by the State Department of Health, Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation.

H.    All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten working days of initial installation. (Ord. 2-9-93 § 3.1, 1993)


13.12.080 Violation—Discontinuance of service.

If violations of this chapter exist or if there has not been any corrective action taken by the consumer within ten days of written notification of deficiencies noted within the survey, the public water purveyor shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the state and city statutes relating to plumbing, safe drinking water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 2-9-93 § 3.2, 1993)

There is hereby created and established a stormwater utility, herein referred to as “utility,” and service charge rate structure. The utility will have regulatory authority and responsibility for planning, design, construction, maintenance, administration and operation of all city stormwater conveyances and facilities. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.040 Ownership of city stormwater facilities and assets.

The city administrator shall determine which of the city’s stormwater assets will be transferred to the utility. Until such transfer, the utility shall operate, maintain and improve existing city stormwater facilities used for the conveyance of stormwaters through, under or over lands or watercourses, beginning at a point where the stormwaters first enter the stormwater system of the city and ending in each instance at a point where the stormwaters exit from the system. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.050 Utility administration.

The stormwater utility shall be administered by the city’s public works department. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.060 Service charge imposed.

All persons otherwise responsible for impervious surfaces within the city which contribute runoff to the stormwater system or who otherwise use or benefit from the stormwater utility of the city will be responsible for paying the stormwater water utility fees as set forth by Resolution No. 06/15/2004 R-51. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.070 System of rates and charges.

A.    Service Fees Imposed. The city will impose stormwater water fee rates and charges on each parcel of real property within the city except governmentally owned streets. The charges shall fund the administration, planning, design, construction, water quality programming, operation, maintenance and repair of existing and future stormwater facilities.

B.    Methods of Determining Contribution of Stormwater.

1.    Contributions of stormwater from nonresidential parcels and residential parcels larger than duplexes have been ascertained through aerial photography by evaluating land surface and measuring the amount of impervious surface.

2.    Contributions of stormwater from residential parcels have been established by estimating residential impervious areas.

C.    Method of Determining Service Fee Rates. Stormwater service fees shall be applied to each parcel of real property within the city (including city-owned properties) except government-owned streets. Service fees shall be differentiated according to the following classifications:

1.    Residential Parcels. Single family residential and duplex parcels shall constitute one ERU.

2.    Undeveloped Parcels. Undeveloped parcels shall have no charges applied.

3.    Other Parcels. Charges for all other parcels shall be computed by multiplying the total ERUs for a parcel by the monthly rate. Total ERUs are calculated by dividing total square feet of impervious surface by three thousand square feet (one ERU).

4.    Credit for On-Site Mitigation. A service charge credit shall be available for those nonsingle family residential customers that exceed the city’s stormwater development standards and/or reduce the city’s downstream costs in providing stormwater capacity; provided, that if the city’s standards are increased in the future, then only those customers who currently exceed the existing standards will continue to be eligible for a service charge credit. If a request for mitigation credit is granted, the credit shall be applied to all charges from the time of the credit request being accepted by the city, and will be reflected on the next billing thirty days after appeal is granted.

Stormwater control facilities located on a parcel may either hold runoff for a period of time and release it at a controlled rate to the stormwater water system (detention), or hold water until it evaporates or infiltrates into the ground (retention).

Credit for improving quality of stormwater runoff will be based on implementation of source or treatment controls which reduce or eliminate pollutants from its stormwater runoff before it enters the city’s stormwater system.

Customers who believe their site conditions warrant a service charge credit may make application to the city by requesting an application package from the city engineer; provided, that no credit shall exceed a forty-five percent reduction of the original service charge amount. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.080 Billing and collection.

A.    Utility Enterprise Fund. This chapter creates the stormwater utility fund. All revenues received from stormwater user fees shall be placed in the enterprise fund as a designated fund, to be left separate and apart from all other city funds. The collection, accounting and expenditure of all stormwater utility funds shall be in accordance with the Utah Uniform Fiscal Procedures Act.

B.    Billing. The city shall bill, or cause to be billed, parcel owners for stormwater utility services. Fees and charges shall be considered delinquent if not paid as determined by the procedures established by the city and shall be an obligation to the city, which shall be subject to recovery in a civil action. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.090 Appeal of charges.

Any nonresidential customer who disagrees with the stormwater rate structure’s application to his/her parcel may apply to the director for a user fee adjustment. The adjustment request must state the grounds for adjustment and must be filed in writing with the director no later than thirty days after receipt of billing. The director shall review the request and basis for user charges to determine whether an error was made in the calculation or application of the fee. The director may approve an adjustment to the fee.

An appeal of the director’s decision may be brought before the city administrator within thirty days after the date of the director’s decision. Decision of the city administrator shall be final and conclusive.

If an appeal of charges is successful, credit will be applied to all charges from the time of the appealed billing and will be reflected on a future billing after the appeal is granted. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.100 No polluted waters discharged to storm sewers.

The only substance allowed to be discharged under this chapter into the city’s stormwater system is stormwater, surface drainage, subsurface drainage, groundwater, roof runoff, cooling water or nonpolluted water. Such water may be discharged only into stormwater facilities which have adequate capacity for the accommodation of such water. Such discharged water shall comply with the city’s stormwater quality standards. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)

13.16.120 Dumping.

A.    It is unlawful for any person to dump or allow to be dumped into any sump, detention basin, storm drain, curb and gutter, drain inlet, or other storm drainage structure that conveys stormwater and/or nonstormwater, any type of debris, petroleum product, chemical, paint, pesticide, herbicide, heavy metal, acid or base product, solid or liquid waste product, hazardous waste product, and/or human or animal waste.

B.    The restrictions set forth in subsection (A) of this section shall not apply to the normal runoff of nonstormwater related to domestic home uses; for example, lawn watering, washing cars, etc. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.130 Enforcement.

This chapter may be enforced through the administrative code enforcement program of the Midvale Municipal Code, or by filing civil or criminal actions in the Midvale City justice court or third district court. The city has sole discretion to decide whether to file a civil or criminal case for a violation. The city may file both, or one or the other. The possibility of an administrative remedy pursuant to administrative code enforcement shall in no way interfere with the city’s right to prosecute violations of this chapter as criminal offenses. The city may use any of the remedies available under the law in both civil and criminal prosecution. If the city chooses to file both civil and criminal charges for the same violation, no civil penalties may be assessed, but all other remedies are available. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.140 Annual report to stormwater utility customers.

The city’s public works department shall cause to be completed an annual report on the stormwater utility which, if accepted, shall be approved by the city council. This report shall summarize the financial activities of the utility and the major areas of expenditure, field activities, accomplishments, income, and the upcoming year’s priorities. (Ord. 6/15/2004O-23 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.150 Long term stormwater management agreement required.

A.    Every parcel of real property, except single family residential parcels and undeveloped parcels, that has been developed or redeveloped on or after March 10, 2003, is required to have its owner enter into an agreement with the city that outlines the responsibilities of the owner for long term stormwater management. This agreement will be recorded with the Salt Lake County recorder’s office and will be binding on future parcel owners.

B.    Every owner of a parcel of real property that is required to enter into an agreement under this section is required to provide an annual report to the city that outlines the maintenance procedures used to keep the parcel’s stormwater facilities functioning properly.

C.    The owner of a parcel of real property is solely responsible for the operation and maintenance of stormwater facilities located on the parcel. The stormwater facilities must be adequately maintained, perform in a working manner, and comply with the terms of any agreement entered into under this section and the Utah Water Quality Act (Section 19-5-101, et seq., Utah Code Annotated, as amended).

D.    After providing no less than three business days’ notice, city personnel are authorized to enter upon any parcel of real property that is required to have its owner enter into an agreement under this section in order to inspect the stormwater facilities on the parcel for the purpose of determining whether the parcel owner is in compliance with this section.

16.04.040 Large subdivision (more than three lots).

The applicant for a large subdivision must meet with the development review committee to obtain its input and recommendation to the planning commission. The applicant shall revise its proposal based on development review committee and shall seek preliminary plat approval from the planning commission.

A.    Design Standards. The following standards apply to the design of major subdivisions:

1.    Lot Standards. All resulting lots shall comply with the lot standards for the zone district. Lots shall be perpendicular to the street. Double frontage lots are prohibited unless the city council through the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission determines that:

a.    The topography or other unusual condition exists that requires deviation from the standard; and

b.    If the rear yard is adjacent to a collector or arterial street, the applicant shall install a six-foot masonry wall or its functional equivalent, unless for aesthetic or safety reasons such requirement is waived.

2.    Street Layout.

a.    Streets shall align with and connect to existing streets on adjoining properties unless the city council after recommendation of the planning and zoning commission determines that the general plan, topography, traffic demands or other conditions make it better to depart from the system.

b.    Streets shall be laid out in a manner that reduces, to the extent possible, dead-end roads and promotes connectivity.

c.    Streets shall be laid out in a manner that provides future access to larger undeveloped and underdeveloped property. The city council, after recommendation by the planning commission, may permit the developer to dedicate an access easement across the developer’s property that shall be used by the developer of the future lot for access. The developer of the undeveloped/underdeveloped property shall use the access easement as a means of ingress/egress and shall construct the street segment necessary to connect the transportation systems of the two developments. Maintenance of the transportation system shall be the responsibility of the entity that owns the underlying property.

d.    The city council after recommendation by the planning commission may grant up to a ten percent density bonus or up to a ten percent reduction to width, depth, frontage, area, and setback requirements when the layout of future access as required herein results in a hardship for the developer.

3.    Landscaping. Along all streets, except those in the Sharon Steel zone, the developer shall install deciduous trees, two inches in caliper, for each thirty feet of frontage.

4.    Infrastructure. The subdivision shall comply with all infrastructure requirements.

5.    Private Streets. The applicant may propose private streets within the subdivision so long as the proposed street(s) include a right-of-way width of thirty-five feet, with twenty feet of pavement installed to city specifications and fire code, two and one-half feet of curb and gutter on each side and either a five-foot sidewalk adjacent to the curb on both sides or a four-foot sidewalk and a five-foot park strip on one side.

a.    Private streets shall align with and connect to existing streets, whether public or private, on adjoining properties unless the city council after recommendation of the planning and zoning commission determines that the general plan, topography, traffic demands or other conditions make it better to depart from the system.

b.    Private streets shall be laid out in a manner that reduces, to the extent possible, dead-end roads and promotes connectivity.

c.    Private streets shall be laid out in a manner that provides future access to larger undeveloped and underdeveloped property.

17-1-2 Scope and application.

The provisions of this title apply to all land and uses of land within the city. This title became effective on January 2, 2002, and may be amended from time to time. A lot annexed and zoned that does not meet the minimum lot standards of this title may be used notwithstanding such requirements, if such lot was validly created. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-1-3 Zoning map.

The boundaries of the zoning districts are set forth on a map entitled “Zoning District Map of the City of Midvale, Utah” and adopted as part of this section. This map shall be kept in the planning department and maintained as provided in subsection (B) of this section.

A.    Unless otherwise expressly defined on the zoning map, district boundary lines are lot lines, section lines, city limit lines, centerlines of streambeds, and centerlines of streets, alleys, or railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended. District boundary lines shall be calculated on the northern and eastern edge of the zoning lines depicted on the zoning map. If uncertainty remains as to the boundary of a district after application of the provisions of this subsection, the planning commission will interpret the district boundary.

B.    All amendments to the zoning map shall be made by ordinance. The city shall, within a reasonable time after adoption of any such amendment, place the amendment on the zoning map. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-1-4 How to use this title.

A general description of the land use regulations follows. This description is intended to provide the reader with some guidance using this title and is not a substitute for the standards, criteria, and procedures contained in this title.

A.    Zoning Map. Prior to considering the development or redevelopment of land, an applicant should refer to the official zoning map to determine which base zoning and overlay districts correspond to the property. The official zoning map is available at the planning department.

B.    Zoning District Chapter. Once the applicant has identified the zoning district, the applicant should refer to the chapter which corresponds to the applicable zoning district(s). Defined terms are identified as hyperlinked proper nouns within the text. Definitions are also found in Chapter 17-2. The applicant should next refer to the site development and design requirements within the zoning district chapter to determine if the property is adequate in size to accommodate the proposed project. The site development and design standards will determine the building setback from the property lines, minimum lot area (if any), minimum open space, build-to lines, maximum height, density, parking requirements for buildings and uses on the property, etc.

C.    Overlay Districts. Some areas earmarked for redevelopment are in an overlay district as well as a base zoning district. Once the overlay district has been identified, the applicant should refer to both the base zoning district chapter and the overlay district chapter that corresponds to the overlay district.

D.    Use Standards. The applicant should then refer to the use table for the district. The applicant should first determine if the desired use is allowed in the district. If the use is allowed as a conditional use, the applicant must complete a discretionary review process to ensure that the impacts of the use on the surrounding area are mitigated. Finally, if the use is an existing legal use that is no longer allowed in the zoning district, and there is a proposal to change or modify a structure associated with the use, the applicant must obtain a variance from the board of adjustment.

E.    Variances/Rezones. If the applicant cannot meet the standards described in subsection (B) of this section, the applicant should determine whether there are alternative development options or any exceptions to the general rules that may accommodate the project. If the project does not meet standards and other development alternatives are not possible, then there are two methods available to attempt to vary the standards: the variance process and a petition for rezone.

1.    The variance process is generally used for existing development, or development of an existing, validly created lot. The appeal authority shall issue a variance upon the applicant’s demonstration that the application meets each variance standard detailed in Chapter 17-3.

2.    A petition for rezone is a request to change the development standards for the property in question. The process for requesting a rezone is detailed in Section 17-3-1. Rezones are discretionary legislative acts.

F.    Subdivision of Land. If the applicant would like to subdivide a piece of property, merge a number of different parcels into one parcel, or resubdivide, the applicant may need to go through the subdivision process (Title 16). The purpose of the subdivision process is to ensure that proposed building sites are appropriate for development; to obtain an accurate and permanent record of the separate interests of land that are created by subdivision of land; to apportion the costs of public services and facilities serving the subdivision; to provide assurances to future buyers of land that the subdivider owns the land to be sold; to provide legal and physical access to each lot; and to provide for maintenance of improvements, utilities, and amenities. There are a number of divisions of land to which the subdivision regulations do not apply. The applicant should review these exceptions to determine if the project will be required to complete the subdivision process. There is also an abbreviated process for projects that only require relocation of a lot line between two lots within an existing subdivision. See Section 16.04.030. (Ord. 2012-09 § 2 (Att. B) (part); Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)

E.    References to Other Regulations, Publications and Documents. Whenever reference is made to a resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or document, it shall be construed as a reference to the most recent edition of such regulation (as amended), resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or document, unless otherwise specifically stated.

F.    Delegation of Authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department or another officer or employee of the city to perform an act or duty, that provision shall be construed as authorizing the department head or officer to delegate that responsibility to others over whom they have authority.

G.    Technical and Nontechnical Terms. Words and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language, but technical words and phrases that may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning.

H.    Public Officials and Agencies. All public officials, bodies, and agencies to which references are made are those of the City of Midvale, unless otherwise indicated.

I.    Mandatory and Discretionary Terms. The words “shall,” “will,” and “must” are always mandatory. The words “may” and “should” are advisory and discretionary terms.

J.    Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly suggests the contrary, conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows:

1.    “And” indicates that all connected items, conditions, provisions, or events apply; and

2.    “Or” indicates that one or more of the connected items, conditions, provisions, or events may apply.

K.    Tenses and Plurals. Words used in one tense (past, present, or future) include all other tenses, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary. The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-1-6 Conflicting provisions.

This title is written to harmonize with federal, state and city laws. To the extent a provision of this title conflicts with a federal, state or local law or private contract, the following rules apply:

A.    Conflict With State or Federal Regulations. If the provisions of this title are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision will control, to the extent permitted by law.

B.    Conflict With Other City Regulations. If the provisions of this title are inconsistent with one another or if they conflict with provisions found in other adopted ordinances, resolutions, or regulations of the city, the more restrictive provision will control.

C.    Conflict With Private Agreements. It is not the intent of this title to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction, or other agreement between private parties. If the provisions of this title impose a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of this title will control. If the provisions of a private agreement impose a greater restriction than this title, the provisions of the private agreement will control. The city shall not be responsible for monitoring or enforcing private agreements. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-1-7 Interpretation.

The community and economic development director shall have the power to interpret the provisions of this title; provided, that the community and economic development director shall consult with the city attorney concerning legal issues. The interpretations shall be consistent with the rules of construction in Section 17-1-5, with the rules of statutory construction, with the rules of conflicting provisions in Section 17-1-6 and shall be consistent over time until changed, in writing, by the community and economic development director. Such interpretations shall be entitled the weight accorded to administrative interpretations by the courts. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-1-8 Creation of vested rights.

The city may alter certain private property rights by amending this title from time to time as provided for in Section 17-3-1.

A.    How Rights Vest. Certain private property rights shall become fixed at law, and may not be altered for a period of time, upon an applicant’s:

1.    Submission of a complete application to develop property that is consistent with this title; and

2.    Payment of all applicable permit fees.

B.    What Rights Vest. The applicant’s rights vest under this title in those rights for which the applicant has applied. For example, if the applicant has applied for a subdivision, and has “vested rights” pursuant to subsection A of this section, the applicant’s rights vest under the subdivision ordinance, and the applicant is entitled to the benefit of the subdivision ordinance in effect at the time of vesting. An applicant’s vested rights under the subdivision ordinance, however, do not vest the applicant under an adopted building, fire or plumbing code, because the applicant has not submitted a complete application for the applicable permit nor paid applicable fees. Applications shall not vest if:

1.    Revisions to this title are pending at the time of application which would prohibit or further condition the approval sought; or

2.    There exists a compelling and countervailing health, safety or welfare reason.

C.    Preservation of Vested Rights/Compliance With Conditions of Approval. An applicant with vested rights must comply with and maintain all conditions of final approval to preserve the vested rights. An applicant’s failure to meet or maintain conditions of approval constitutes the applicant’s knowing and wilful waiver of the applicant’s vested rights.

D.    Applicability of Ordinances That Are General in Nature. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of city ordinances or regulations that are general in nature, applicable to all property subject to land use regulation, and necessary to preserve the health, safety or welfare of the community. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-1-9 Transitional provisions.

A.    Violations Continue. Any violation of the previous zoning ordinance will continue to be a violation under this title and will be subject to penalties and enforcement under Chapter 17-3, unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the provisions of this title.

B.    Legal Nonconformities. Any legal nonconformity under the previous zoning ordinance or created by the adoption of this title will be a legal nonconformity under this title. Nonconforming uses may only be expanded within the area of an existing conforming building. If a legal nonconforming use or structure under the previous zoning ordinance becomes conforming because of the adoption of this title, then the nonconformity expires. A legal nonconforming use will become an illegal nonconforming use if the use lapses for twelve consecutive months and may not be re-established.

C.    Approved Projects and Existing Lots. The provisions of this title shall affect approved projects and existing lots as follows:

1.    Use permits, variances, architectural or design approvals, subdivided lots, master plan overlays, subdivision maps and planned unit developments, which are valid on January 2, 2002, shall remain valid until their expiration date. Projects with valid approvals or permits may be constructed as approved; provided, that the permit or project approval is valid and has not lapsed. Any change in the use or occupation of such land shall be made in accordance with the amended provisions of this title.

2.    No provision of this title shall require any change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any structure for which a permit has been issued prior to January 2, 2002.

D.    Vested Rights/Applications in Progress/Reapplication. An applicant with rights vested before January 2, 2002, and pending approval on January 2, 2002, may opt for review wholly under the terms of the previous zoning ordinance or under this title. Any reapplication for a permit that has expired must comply with the standards in effect at the time of reapplication. Projects for which no application has been submitted and accepted as complete prior to January 2, 2002, shall be subject to all requirements and standards of this title. (Ord. 8/22/2006O-14 § 1 (part), 2006; Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)

2.    The legal description of all property included; and

3.    A written statement addressing the criteria required for approval pursuant to subsection E of this section.

B.    Hearings Before Planning Commission. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on all amendments to this title or to the zoning map. The community and economic development director shall cause a notice, including a description of the property for which the zoning amendment is requested, a brief explanation of the proposed zoning, and the date, place and time of the public hearing, to be prepared as provided in Section 17-3-9. The purpose of the notice is to reasonably inform surrounding property owners and jurisdictions of the application. No minor omission or defect in the notice or mailing shall be deemed to impair the validity of the proceedings to consider the application.

C.    Action by Planning Commission. Following the public hearing, the planning commission shall adopt a written recommendation to the city council, advising the council to approve, disapprove, or modify the proposal. If the planning commission fails to take action within thirty days of the close of the public hearing, the city council shall consider the matter forwarded from the planning commission with a negative recommendation.

D.    Hearing Before City Council. The city council must hold a public hearing on all proposed amendments to this title or zoning map forwarded from the planning commission. Notice of the public hearing shall be consistent with subsection B of this section.

E.    Criteria/Required Findings. The city’s zoning is the result of a detailed and comprehensive appraisal of the city’s present and future land use allocation needs. In order to establish and maintain sound, stable, and desirable development within the city, rezoning of land is to be discouraged and allowed only under the limited circumstances herein described. Therefore, the planning commission may recommend, and the city council may grant, a rezoning application only if it determines, in written findings, that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the policies and goals of the general plan and that the applicant has demonstrated that the:

1.    Proposed rezoning is necessary either to comply with the general plan proposed land use map or to provide land for a community need that was not anticipated at the time of adoption of the general plan;

2.    Existing zoning was either the result of a clerical error or a mistake of fact, or that it failed to take into account the constraints on development created by the natural characteristics of the land, including but not limited to, steep slopes, flood plain, unstable soils, and inadequate drainage; or

3.    Land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage redevelopment of the area or to recognize the changed character of the area.

F.    Temporary or Emergency Zoning. The city council may enact an ordinance, without a public hearing or planning commission recommendation, which establishes temporary zoning regulations for any part or all of the area within the municipality if the:

1.    City council makes a written finding of compelling, countervailing public interest; or

2.    The area is not zoned.

Temporary zoning regulations may prohibit or regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, or alteration of any building or structure or any subdivision approval. The city council shall establish a period of limited effect for the ordinance, which period may not exceed six months. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)

17-3-4 Conditional use review.

There are certain uses that, because of unique characteristics or the potential for detrimental impacts, may not be compatible in some areas of a zone or may be compatible only if certain conditions are imposed. The community and economic development department will evaluate all conditional use permit applications. The department may issue administrative conditional use permits or may recommend to the planning commission certain conditions of approval to applications for conditional use permits. The community and economic development department, and the planning commission, shall review all applications for a conditional use permit according to the following procedure:

A.    Development Review Committee. If determined necessary by the community and economic development department, an applicant shall attend a pre-application conference with the development review committee to discuss the proposed improvements associated with the conditional use or administrative conditional use and the conditions that the staff would recommend to mitigate proposed adverse impacts. This meeting will allow other city departments to provide comments on the application.

B.    Application. An applicant must pay all appropriate fees and must file a complete application. The applicant shall submit all information required in Section 17-3-3(B) through (E), if applicable.

C.    Notice/Posting. Upon receipt of a complete application, the community and economic development department shall provide reasonable notice as provided in Section 17-3-9. The planning commission shall conduct a public hearing on the conditional use permit application and shall either approve, deny, or modify and approve the application. The community and economic development department shall accept written public comment on an administrative conditional use permit application and shall either approve, deny or modify and approve the application.

D.    Standards For Review. The city shall not issue a conditional use permit unless the community and economic development department, in the case of an administrative conditional use, or the planning commission, for all other conditional uses, concludes that the application complies with the standards of review specific to the zone in which the use is proposed.

E.    Transferability. A conditional use permit runs with the land.

F.    Expiration. Unless otherwise indicated, conditional use permits and administrative conditional use permits shall expire one year from the date of approval, unless the conditionally permitted use has commenced on the site. Prior to the expiration of the conditional use permit, the planning commission may grant two additional extensions of up to one year each if the applicant demonstrates that the extension would not result in an unmitigated impact.

G.    Revocation. If the community and economic development department determines that the holder of a conditional use permit or an administrative conditional use permit is in violation of the terms or conditions upon which the permit was issued, the community and economic development department shall notice the permit holder and schedule a hearing before the planning commission at which the permit holder must show cause to the planning commission why the conditional use permit or administrative conditional use permit should not be revoked. If the planning commission determines that the terms or conditions of the permit have been violated, it shall cause the permit holder to specify how the holder will promptly comply with the terms and conditions of the permit, or it shall revoke the permit.

H.    Appeals. Appeals must be pursuant to Section 17-3-14. (Ord. 2012-09 § 2 (Att. B) (part); Ord. 7/11/2006O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2006; Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)

17-3-7 Sign permit review.

This code regulates to the maximum extent allowed by law.

A.    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide minimum standards which are intended to safeguard property, public health, safety, and general welfare and to help establish a unique aesthetic character for the city through the establishment of guidelines governing the size, height, design, location, display period, and maintenance of signs. In order to help achieve this purpose, it is the goal of the general provisions as well as the specific provisions in each zone:

1.    To encourage signs that help to visually organize the activities of the city, lend order and meaning to business identification, and make it easier for the public and delivery services to identify and locate their destinations;

2.    To encourage a positive business atmosphere;

3.    To implement the urban design goals and policies of the city established in Chapter 2 of the Midvale City General Plan;

4.    To improve the visual quality of thoroughfares and eliminate visual clutter by limiting the types and display periods of temporary signs;

5.    To minimize unnecessary distractions to motorists, protect pedestrians, and provide safe working conditions for those persons who are required to install, maintain, repair, or remove signs;

6.    To eliminate the visual degradation imposed by billboards due to excessive height and copy areas through the city-wide prohibition of such signs; and

7.    To assure that all signs, in terms of size, scale, height, and location, are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the size of development that they serve.

B.    Scope.

1.    It is not the intent of this section to regulate the message content of signs or to regulate signs that are not visible to the general public.

2.    In interpreting the provisions contained in this section, such provisions shall be considered the minimum standards which are necessary to accomplish the purposes described above.

C.    Exceptions. The following signs are not regulated by this code:

1.    Signs of a governmental nature for the control of traffic and other regulatory purposes such as street signs, danger signs, railroad crossing signs and signs of public service companies indicating danger and aids to service or safety;

2.    Signs which are associated with public and quasi-public organization functions which are clearly of a temporary nature;

3.    Interior signs;

4.    Flags, emblems, or insignias of any nation or political subdivision;

5.    Signs not exceeding one square foot in area and bearing only property numbers, post box numbers or names of occupants of premises;

6.    Legal notices, identification information, or directional signs erected by governmental bodies;

7.    Commemorative plaques of recognized historical agencies, or identification emblems or symbols of religious orders; provided, that no such plaque, symbol or identification emblem exceeds three square feet in area, and such that the plaque, symbol or emblem be placed flat against a building; and

8.    Existing signage which has been previously approved shall not be required to comply with this chapter insofar as the initial installation is concerned. All other requirements are in force.

D.    Nonconforming Signs. A nonconforming sign shall not be reconstructed, raised, moved, placed, extended or enlarged unless said sign is changed so as to conform to all provisions of this chapter. Alterations shall not be interpreted to include changing the text or copy of off-premises advertising signs, theater signs, outdoor bulletin or other similar signs which are designed to accommodate changeable copy, or modifying a sign to include an electronic display as described in subsection (O) of this section.

E.    Abatement. Prohibited signs are Class C misdemeanors. The nonconforming sign provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to prohibited signs.

F.    Permits. Except as provided in this code, it is unlawful to display, erect, relocate, or alter any sign without first submitting a sign permit application to the planning and zoning department in writing and obtaining a sign permit. When a city sign permit has been issued, it is unlawful to change, modify, alter, or otherwise deviate from the terms or conditions of said permit without prior approval of the building official and the planning and zoning department. A written record of such approval shall be entered upon the original permit application and maintained in the files of said city official. The application for a sign permit shall be made by the owner or tenant of the property on which the sign is to be located, or his/her authorized agent, or a licensed sign contractor, and shall be accompanied by the following plans and other information:

1.    The name, address and telephone number of the owner or persons entitled to possession of the sign or control of the same and of the sign contractor or erector;

2.    The location by street address of the proposed sign structure;

3.    A site plan and elevation drawings of the proposed sign, caption of the proposed sign and elevations of building facades if the application is for a wall sign. The site plan shall include the proposed location of the sign in relation to the face of the building or to the boundaries of the lot on which it is situated;

4.    Plans indicating the scope and structural detail of the work to be done, including details of all connections, guy lines, supports and footings, and materials to be used, stamped by a professional engineer licensed in the state;

5.    Application for, and required information for such application, an electrical permit for all electric signs if the person building the sign is to make the electrical connection; and

6.    A statement of sign value as personal property.

G.    Permit Tag. A permit tag issued by the Midvale City department of community and economic development must be affixed to each permanent sign in a manner that is visible from the sidewalk or nearest convenient location.

H.    Completion. If the work authorized under a sign permit has not been completed within three months after date of issuance, said permit shall become null and void, and there shall be no refund of any fee required by this section. An extension of time may be granted at the sole discretion of the city upon a showing of good cause.

I.    Maintenance. All signs and advertising structures shall be maintained in good condition. Signs relating to a product no longer available for purchase or to a business which has moved shall be removed or the advertising copy removed within thirty days of such unavailability, closure, or relocation unless said sign has been determined to be of special historic or artistic value as determined by the Midvale City planning commission.

J.    Size. The following criteria apply to calculating sign size:

1.    Lot Frontage. If more than one use or business occupies a lot, the lot frontage is to be used to calculate the sign sizes for a combined total of a ground or projecting sign, not for each use. The total may then be divided between the uses.

2.    Flat or Wall Signs. There may be any number of flat or wall signs, provided their total does not exceed the maximum percentage of wall area coverage allowed.

K.    Traffic Hazards. Signs or other advertising structures shall not be erected at the intersection of any streets or driveways in such manner as to obstruct free and clear vision; or at any location where by reason of the position, shape or color it may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic sign, signal device, or make use of words, phrases, symbols or characters in such manner as to interfere with, mislead or confuse vehicle operators.

1.    At intersecting streets and within the clear view area, there shall be no signs allowed, unless a sign is less than three feet in height as measured from the average grade of the intersecting streets.

2.    For signs over pedestrian ways, the clearance between the ground and the bottom of any projecting or ground sign shall not be less than eight feet.

3.    For signs over driveways for vehicular traffic, the minimum clearance shall be fourteen feet.

4.    For signs more than three feet in height and having less than an eight-foot clearance, the front setback shall be the same as for buildings in that zoning district. In no case shall the front setback be less than eighteen inches from the front property line as measured from the leading edge of the sign.

L.    Signs over Public Property. No sign shall be located on publicly owned land or inside street rights-of-way except signs required and erected by permission of an authorized public agency. This restriction shall include, but not be limited to, handbills, posters, advertisements or notices that are fastened, placed, posted, painted, or attached in any way upon any curbstone, lamp post, telephone pole, electric light or power pole, hydrant, bridge, tree, rock, sidewalk or street. No projecting sign attached to a building shall project over public property more than four feet and in no case be closer than four feet to the curb line or edge of street, whichever is more restrictive. 

M.    Clearance and Setbacks. The following criteria apply to all signs:

1.    Clear View. At intersecting streets, all signs shall be located outside of the clear view area.

2.    Setbacks. Ground signs must be set back at least three feet from a public sidewalk or property line.

N.    Exempt Sign Changes. The following changes do not require a sign permit:

1.    The changing of the advertising copy or message of signs specifically designed for the use of replaceable copy;

2.    Electrical maintenance, repainting, or cleaning maintenance of a sign;

3.    The repair of a sign;

4.    Real estate signs no larger than six square feet;

5.    Campaign signs no larger than sixteen square feet; and

6.    Name plate signs.

O.    Off-Premises Sign Upgrade. An existing off-premises sign may be modified, without affecting such sign’s nonconforming use or noncomplying structure status, to include an electronic display so long as the proposed modification complies with each of the following requirements:

1.    The applicant must submit a complete application in accordance with subsection (F) of this section and comply with the other requirements of the Midvale City Code.

2.    The sign must be located along I-15, 900 East/Husky Highway or State Street.

3.    The electronic display may only use light emitting diode (LED) displays, or a similar technology approved by the planning and zoning department.

4.    A changeable message sign face that utilizes lighting technologies (such as light emitting diodes) to create changeable messages shall be equipped with a light sensor that automatically adjusts the illuminance of the changeable message sign face as ambient lighting changes.

5.    The interval between message changes on an electronic display shall not be more frequent than eight seconds and the actual message rotation process must be accomplished in one-quarter second or less.

6.    Electronic display sign faces which contain, include, or are illuminated by any flashing, intermittent, full motion video, scrolling, strobing, racing, blinking, changes in color, fade in or fade out or any other imitation of movement or motion, or any other means not providing constant illumination are prohibited.

7.    Off-premises signs that are within six hundred linear feet along State Street or 900 East and five hundred linear feet along I-15, as measured along the same side of the right-of-way as an off-premises sign that has been upgraded to include an electronic display, do not qualify to be upgraded.

8.    Only one sign face of the same “layered” off-premises sign(s) (i.e., two or more off-premises signs mounted in vertical tiers on the same support structure, so that such sign faces are effectively visible at the same time from any vantage point, as reasonably determined by the city) may be upgraded to include an electronic display.

9.    Only one sign face of the same “side-by-side” off-premises sign(s) (i.e., two or more off-premises signs mounted horizontally on the same support structure, so that such sign faces are effectively visible at the same time from any vantage point, as reasonably determined by the city) may be upgraded to include an electronic display.

10.    Both faces of a double-sided off-premises sign, facing opposite directions (i.e., mounted back-to-back on the same support structure, so that such sign faces are not visible at the same time from any vantage point), qualify to be upgraded to electronic displays.

11.    The text, images and graphics of the sign shall be static and complete within themselves, without continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other sign.

12.    In no event shall an electronic display sign face increase the nighttime ambient illumination when replacing an existing illuminated billboard face and in no event shall an electronic display sign face, replacing a nonilluminated billboard face, increase nighttime ambient illumination by more than 0.3 foot-candles. In both instances, this measurement will be determined when measured perpendicular to the electronic display sign face at a distance based on the sign face size in accordance with the following formula:

	Changeable Message Sign Face Size (in sq. ft.)	Measurement Distance (in ft.)

	0—100	100

	101—350	150

	651—1,000	250

13.    The applicant shall certify its compliance with the above illuminance within a week of operating the electronic display and shall produce a copy of the certification upon request.

14.    Any off-premises sign face upgraded under this subsection (O) to a sign located within three hundred fifty feet and oriented toward a legally occupied residential dwelling, measured from the electronic display face to the residential dwelling, shall be required to adhere to a curfew as described below:

a.    If an off-premises sign with an electronic display face is within three hundred fifty feet of a legally occupied dwelling that is within a forty-five-degree radius area measured from the center point of the electronic display face, then this electronic display face shall display only one static illuminated message nightly from eleven p.m. until six a.m.; or

b.    If an off-premises sign with an electronic display face is within one hundred fifty feet of a legally occupied dwelling that is within a ninety-degree radius area measured from the center point of the electronic display face, then this electronic display face shall be shut off nightly from eleven p.m. until six a.m.

The curfew conditions in subsections (O)(14)(a) and (b) of this section are not applicable to the extent that the message displayed is an emergency public safety warning or alert, such as an AMBER Alert.

15.    No off-premises sign located within a residential (SF-1, SF-2, RM-12, RM-25) or historic zoning (HC) district shall be upgraded to include an electronic display.

16.    An upgrade may not increase the height or the size of the display area of the sign.

17.    This subsection (O) does not authorize the location of a new off-premises sign in a location not permitted or allowed under the existing and applicable ordinances. (Ord. 2014-03 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 5/1/2007O-5 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 11/23/2004O-34 § 1(1), 2004; Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-3-8 Telecommunications.

(Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-3-9 Notice.

The city shall notice all public hearings that are required by this title.

A.    Public Hearing Requirements. The community and economic development department shall provide reasonable notice of all public hearings, which notice shall contain a description of the property, with a brief explanation of the proposed use, and the date, place and time of the public hearing, which notice shall be:

1.    Posted in at least three public places in the city, one of which shall include the subject property for annexation, rezone, and subdivision applications. All other applications shall be posted in at least two public places in the city;

2.    Published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least fourteen days before the date of the planning commission hearing; and

3.    Sent by first class mail to all record owners of subject property within three hundred feet of the subject property.

B.    Notice to Nearby Entities. The community and economic development department shall provide notice by first class mail, at least seven days before the date of a “predevelopment activity,” as that term is defined in U.C.A. Section 10-9-103, to:

1.    The county, if the county’s unincorporated territory is within one mile of the subject property; and

2.    Each municipality within one mile of the property that is involved in the predevelopment activity.

C.    Purpose of Notice. The purpose of the notice is to reasonably inform surrounding property owners and jurisdictions of an application for zoning, multi-family, commercial or industrial development or a proposed modification to the general plan. No minor omission or defect in the notice or mailing shall be deemed to impair the validity of the proceedings to consider the zoning application. If at or prior to the public hearing an omission or defect in the mailed notice is brought to the attention of the planning commission, it shall determine whether the omission or defect impairs or has impaired a surrounding property owner’s ability to participate in the public hearing, upon which finding it shall continue the hearing on the application for zoning for at least fourteen days. Any omission or defect in the mailed notice that is not brought to the commissions’ attention or that the commission finds did not impair a surrounding property owner’s ability to participate in the hearing shall not affect the validity of the zoning proceedings.

D.    Effect of Notice. Proof that notice was given pursuant to subsection A of this section is prima facie evidence that notice was properly given. If notice given under authority of this section is not challenged as provided for under state law within thirty days from the date of the hearing for which the challenged notice was given, the notice was adequate and proper. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-3-10 Termination of projects for inaction.

Applicants must move their projects either to approval or denial in a reasonably expeditious manner.

An applicant may appeal the community and economic development director’s denial of a project for inaction to the planning commission in the same manner as any other appeal. The planning commission may reinstate subject to conditions, or may deny reinstatement. If reinstatement is denied, the application is formally denied. (Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001)


17-3-11 Penalties.

17-3-15 Constitutional takings—Review and appeal.

To promote the protection of private property rights and to prevent the physical taking or exaction of private property without just compensation, the city council and all commissions and boards shall adhere to the following before authorizing the seizure or exaction of property:

A.    Takings Review Procedure. Prior to any proposed action to exact or seize property, the city attorney shall review the proposed action to determine if a constitutional taking requiring “just compensation” would occur. The city attorney shall review all such matters pursuant to the guidelines established in subsection (B) of this section. Upon identifying a possible constitutional taking, the city attorney shall, in a confidential, protected writing, inform the council, commission or board of the possible consequences of its action. This opinion shall be advisory only. No liability shall be attributed to the city for failure to follow the recommendation of the city attorney.

B.    Takings Guidelines. The city attorney shall review whether the action constitutes a constitutional taking under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, or under Article I, Section 22 of the Utah Constitution. The city attorney shall determine whether the proposed action bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest and whether the action is roughly proportionate and reasonably related to the legitimate governmental interest. The city attorney shall also determine whether the action deprives the private property owner of all reasonable use of the property. These guidelines are advisory only and shall not expand nor limit the scope of the city’s liability for a constitutional taking.

C.    Appeal. Any owner of private property who believes that his/her property is proposed to be “taken” by an otherwise final action of the city may appeal the city’s decision to the appeal authority within thirty days after the decision is made. The appeal must be filed in writing with the city recorder. The appeal authority shall hear and approve and remand or reject the appeal within fourteen calendar days after the appeal is filed. The appeal authority, with advice from the city attorney, shall review the appeal pursuant to the guidelines in subsection (B) of this section. The decision of the appeal authority shall be in writing and a copy given to the appellant and to the city council, commission or board that took the initial action. The appeal authority’s rejection of an appeal constitutes exhaustion of administrative remedies rendering the matter suitable for appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2012-09 § 2 (Att. B) (part): Ord. 12-11-2001C § 2 (part), 2001. Formerly 17-3-14)

i.    Wall-Mounted Antenna. Two types of wall-mounted antennas are allowed: stealth-mounted and non-stealth-mounted. Antennas mounted directly on existing parapet walls, penthouses, or mechanical equipment rooms are considered a wall-mounted antenna if no portion of the antenna extends above the roofline of the building or extends no more than four feet horizontally from the face of the building. Whip antennas are not allowed on a wall-mounted antenna structure. Antennas, equipment, and the supporting structures shall be selected to achieve the architectural compatibility with the host structure to which they are attached.

(A)    Stealth facilities shall be designed to substantially conceal and camouflage the antennas and associated equipment.

(1)    The planning commission shall review and may grant approval for any new antenna(s) that require construction of a new screening wall. New screening wall(s) shall be in harmony with the structure’s mass, architectural features, and overall aesthetics. Architectural and structural renderings, three-dimensional representation, line-of-sight diagrams, photo simulations, and/or building elevations of the proposed modifications may be required to effectively demonstrate the requested changes meeting the intent of this chapter.

(2)    Area Limitations for Stealth Wall-Mounted Antennas. The total area for all stealth wall-mounted antennas and supporting structures combined shall not exceed five percent of any exterior wall of the building. Stealth wall-mounted antennas may occupy a maximum of four walls. The total calculated area is the sum of each individual antenna and the visible portion of the supporting structure as viewed when looking directly at the face of the building.

(B)    Non-stealth facilities shall only be considered in locations in which adverse visual impacts are not a substantial concern due to the location of the facility, the nature of the surrounding land uses, and is not visible from public vantage points.

(1)    Area Limitations for Non-Stealth Wall-Mounted Antennas. The total area for all non-stealth wall-mounted antennas and supporting structures combined shall not exceed forty square feet for each exterior wall of the building or a total of one hundred sixty square feet per building. The total calculated area is the sum of each individual antenna and the visible portion of the supporting structure as viewed when looking directly at the face of the building.

ii.    Roof-Mounted Antenna. Two types of roof-mounted antennas are allowed: stealth-mounted and non-stealth-mounted. Antennas, equipment, and the supporting structures shall be selected to achieve the architectural compatibility with the host structure to which they are attached. Roof-mounted antennas are an allowed use only on a flat roof and shall be screened, constructed and painted to match the structure to which they are attached. The planning commission shall review and may grant approval to place roof-mounted stealth antennas on a pitched roof if the antenna(s) are compatible with the existing structure. Roof-mounted antennas may be mounted on existing penthouses or mechanical equipment rooms if the antennas and antenna support structures are enclosed or visually screened from view.

(A)    Stealth facilities shall be designed to substantially conceal and camouflage the antennas and associated equipment.

(1)    Antennas shall be mounted at least five feet behind any parapet wall or from the exterior wall of the building. The maximum height of an antenna mounted between five and ten feet behind a parapet or exterior wall shall be directly proportional to the setback distance, and may not exceed a height of ten feet above the top of the parapet wall or roof line of the building.

(2)    The planning commission shall review and may grant approval for any new antenna(s) that require construction of a new screening wall. New screening wall(s) shall be in harmony with the structure’s mass, architectural features, and overall aesthetics. Architectural and structural renderings, three-dimensional representation, line-of-sight diagrams, photo simulations, and/or building elevations of the proposed modifications may be required to effectively demonstrate the requested changes meeting the intent of this chapter.

(B)    Non-stealth facilities shall only be considered in locations in which adverse visual impacts are not a substantial concern due to the location of the facility and the nature of the surrounding land uses.

iii.    Power Lines. All power lines on the lot leading to the accessory building and antenna structure of the telecommunications facility shall be installed underground.

iv.    Monopole. A conditional use permit for a monopole may be granted in a residential zone district only if the planning commission finds that:

(A)    The monopole antenna does not exceed thirty-five feet in height;

(B)    Monopole with antennas and antennas support structure does not exceed two feet in width;

(C)    The antenna tower will be placed on a parcel, which is not occupied by a residential use, such as a school, church, or other nonresidential use, which is otherwise legally located in that residential zone;

(D)    The antenna tower will be located no closer than two hundred feet from the nearest residential structure; and

(E)    The monopole will be disguised as, or otherwise integrated with, a light pole or similar utility structure located on the parcel to minimize and mitigate the visual impact of the antenna. Monopoles shall be fenced with a six-foot chain-link fence and the climbing pegs removed from the lower twenty feet of the monopole. In circumstances where the accessory building and fence may be viewable from any public road or public space, the planning commission may require alternative building and fencing materials such as masonry, wrought iron or chain link with colored vinyl coating, depending on the location.

(F)    No monopole or lattice tower may be located within one thousand feet of another monopole or lattice tower unless it is for the bona fide public services of a public transit district as defined in Section 17A-2-1001 et seq. of the Utah Code Annotated and as certified by said public transit district.

v.    Review Criteria. Each applicant for a telecommunications facility must demonstrate:

(A)    Compatibility of the proposed structure with the height and mass of existing adjacent buildings and utility structures;

(2)    Monopole with antennas and antennas support structure does not exceed two feet in width;

(3)    The antenna tower will be placed on a parcel, which is not occupied by a residential use, such as a school, church, or other nonresidential use, which is otherwise legally located in that residential zone;

(4)    The antenna tower will be located no closer than two hundred feet from the nearest residential structure; and

(5)    The monopole will be disguised as, or otherwise integrated with, a light pole or similar utility structure located on the parcel to minimize and mitigate the visual impact of the antenna. Monopoles shall be fenced with a six-foot chain-link fence and the climbing pegs removed from the lower twenty feet of the monopole. In circumstances where the accessory building and fence may be viewable from any public road or public space, the planning commission may require alternative building and fencing materials such as masonry, wrought iron or chain link with colored vinyl coating, depending on the location.

(6)    No monopole or lattice tower may be located within one thousand feet of another monopole or lattice tower unless it is for the bona fide public services of a public transit district as defined in Section 17A-2-1001 et seq. of the Utah Code Annotated and as certified by said public transit district.

iv.    No validated complaints or violations concerning animals (unlicensed pets, excessive noise, bites, stray) have been recorded against the applicant by the city.

g.    Temporary Dwellings. The purpose of this subsection is to allow existing permanent dwellings to be occupied temporarily by the property owner while a new permanent dwelling is under construction on the same property. Because the need is transitory, the approval of temporary dwellings does not constitute a long-term land use commitment that conflicts with the comprehensive plan and implementing ordinances. Nothing in this subsection is intended to allow the use of mobile/modular homes, travel trailers/RVs, or any other living accommodation as a temporary dwelling. Temporary dwellings shall be regulated as follows:

i.    Every temporary dwelling authorized in accordance with this section shall meet the following minimum criteria:

(A)    A temporary dwelling permit application and other submittals required for conditional use permits must be submitted for approval. A demolition bid for the existing structure from a qualified demolition contractor must be submitted with the application;

(B)    Prior to approval of a temporary dwelling, a performance bond must be in place that guarantees the demolition of the existing structure in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars (in 2006 dollars adjusted for inflation) or the bid amount plus ten percent, whichever is greater;

(C)    The applicant must submit an agreement, on a form supplied by the city, signed by the property owner, that provides the city with the authority to demolish the temporary structure if the property owner has not demolished it within thirty days of the final inspection and work on the new home having been completed. The agreement shall also give the city permission, at its sole discretion, to abate and/or demolish any structure permitted by this subsection that continues beyond the term of the temporary housing agreement and any renewals granted, including new construction. As part of the agreement the applicant will deliver to the city a properly executed quit claim deed to Midvale City that is ready to be recorded but will not be recorded unless the applicant defaults on any of the terms of this subsection or the agreement. The decision to record this document will be the sole discretion of the city;

(D)    The temporary dwelling shall be maintained in a manner which will facilitate its removal upon expiration or termination of the permit;

(E)    There shall be no more than one temporary dwelling per parcel nor shall more than one temporary dwelling permit be issued per parcel, per twenty-five years;

(F)    No temporary structure shall be approved that is not occupied by the property owner;

(G)    No construction shall be permitted that, even temporarily, violates the applicable building codes or land use ordinance, including required spacing between structures.

ii.    Term, Renewal and Revocation.

(A)    Term. A temporary dwelling permit issued to an applicant shall be valid for one year or until the new permanent dwelling is completed, whichever occurs first. Temporary dwelling permits may be renewed only under the circumstances set forth below.

(B)    Renewal. A request for renewal of a temporary dwelling permit issued shall be submitted at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the permit. A temporary dwelling permit may be renewed only once and for a term no longer than the term of the initial temporary dwelling permit. 

(C)    Revocation. A permit issued under this section may be revoked if the city determines that:

(1)    Any of the requirements of this chapter have not been satisfied;

(2)    Any of the conditions attached to the permit have not been met; or

(3)    The grounds for authorizing the permit no longer exist.

The temporary dwelling permit may be revoked after notice to the holder of the permit. If the permit holder has not demonstrated to the city within seven days of the mailing of such notice that no grounds for revocation exist, then the permit may be revoked and the matter referred to the code enforcement officer for appropriate action pursuant to municipal code.

(D)    Expiration. Occupancy of a temporary dwelling shall cease immediately upon expiration of a temporary dwelling permit and within fourteen days after mailing, by certified mail, of notification of revocation. The temporary structure must be demolished within thirty days of expiration or revocation of the permit, or the city may commence demolition work in accordance with the signed agreement.

(E)    Transferability. A permit issued under this subsection is not transferable except to future owners of the same property, who must sign an affidavit agreeing to use the permit only under the same terms, time frames, conditions, responsibilities, and agreements that the original permit holder agreed to.

(F)    Certificates of Occupancy. No certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy shall be granted for the new dwelling unit until the temporary dwelling unit and any debris, junk or refuse has been removed from the property to the satisfaction of the city.

h.    Chickens. Subject to the requirements of this section and any other applicable provision of this code, hen chickens (and no roosters or other types of fowl) regardless of age, in the amount set forth below, may be kept on a lot or parcel of land for the sole purpose of producing eggs.

i.    The number of hen chickens which may be kept shall be limited based on the size of the lot or parcel as follows:

(A)    Lots with at least one-half acre: up to eight.

The coop shall also meet the minimum setback for accessory structures within this zoning district. The coop and enclosure shall be hidden from the public view through the use of opaque fencing materials, vegetative screening, or other means allowed within this part. Because a corner lot technically does not include a rear yard, the owner of a corner lot may choose one of the “side” yards to function as a rear yard for the purposes of keeping chickens and locating the coop.

(F)    The coop and enclosure shall be maintained in a neat and sanitary condition and shall be cleaned as necessary to prevent any odor detectable at a property line. At a minimum the coop and enclosed area shall be cleaned weekly, although waste may be composted so long as the composting area meets the setback requirements that apply to the coop and prevent any odor detectable at the property line.

(G)    No chicken shall be permitted to roam outside the coop or enclosure.

iv.    Chicken feed shall be stored in rodent- and predator-proof containers.

v.    Water shall be available to the chickens at all times. A watering device that incorporates a water warming device shall be supplied, used and maintained.

vi.    Chickens shall not be slaughtered on site.

i.    Apiary. The purpose of this subsection is to establish certain requirements of sound beekeeping practices, which are intended to avoid problems that may otherwise be associated with the keeping of bees in populated areas.

i.    No more than the following number of colonies may be kept on any tract within the city, based upon the size of the tract upon which the apiary is situated:

(A)    Less than or equal to one-half acre in size: two colonies;

Said barrier shall be parallel to the property line extending ten feet beyond the colony in each direction, forcing a flight pattern elevation of at least six feet above grade.

(B)    A water source shall be provided on the property and no nearer than twenty feet to the hive to avoid bees congregating on nearby properties in a search for water.

(C)    A sign conspicuously posted setting forth the name and phone number or other identifying marks, such as a registration number, of the responsible beekeeper.

iii.    In addition to the aforementioned conditions, the applicant shall ensure compliance at all times with the following conditions:

(A)    All honey bee colonies shall be kept in Langstroth-type hives with removable frames, which shall be kept in sound and usable condition.

(B)    All honey bee colonies shall be registered with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

(C)    Maintenance shall be such that no bee comb or other materials are left upon the grounds of the apiary site. Upon removal from the hive, all such materials shall promptly be disposed of in a sealed container or placed within a building or other bee-proof enclosure.

(D)    All colonies shall be maintained with marked queens. The colony shall be promptly requeened if it exhibits unusual aggressive characteristics by stinging or attempting to sting without due provocation or swarming. Regardless of colony behavior, each colony shall be requeened on a yearly basis.

(E)    Each Utah apiary shall meet all requirements and inspection schedules deemed necessary by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

(F)    Notwithstanding compliance with the various requirements of this subsection, it shall be unlawful for any beekeepers to keep any colony or colonies in such a manner or of such disposition as to cause any unhealthy condition, interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of human or animal life of others or interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of any public property or property of others.

Upon receipt of information that any colony situated within the city is not being kept in compliance with the conditions pursuant to the approved conditional use permit, an investigation and subsequent hearing before the city’s hearing officer per Chapter 8.05 and the appeal authority per Chapter 17-3 may result and may result in the revocation of the conditional use permit.

Benches and shelters installed by the Utah Transit Authority or other public agencies shall be exempt from the payment of a fee. A change in the text of the sign for the bench or shelter or a substitution of benches or shelters shall not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee if the bench or shelter is placed in the same location as originally permitted.

g.    Revocation and Removal. The issuance of a permit to locate a bench or shelter within the city of Midvale creates only a license, revocable upon a showing of cause by the city, and shall create no permanent rights of any kind. Each bench or shelter must be removed within fourteen days of written notification. Benches or shelters not moved within the fourteen-day period will be removed by the city at the owner’s expense. Removal expense per bench shall be calculated based on using a two-man crew and one truck for one hour.

A substitution of newspaper or ad stands shall not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee if the newspaper or ad stand is placed in the same location as originally permitted.

e.    Revocation and Removal. The issuance of a permit to locate a newspaper or ad stand within the city of Midvale creates only a license, revocable upon a showing of cause by the city, and shall create no permanent rights of any kind. Each newspaper or ad stand must be removed within fourteen days of written notification. Newspaper or ad stands not moved within the fourteen-day period will be removed by the city at the owner’s expense.

Structural features such as fountains, pools, statues, and benches shall also be considered part of the landscaping, but such objects alone shall not meet the requirements of landscaping.

B.    Installation Time Frame Requirements. Landscape materials must be installed within six months of occupancy/notice of violation. This shall apply to all new or existing residential structures that are in a blighted condition, which do not comply with this chapter. This time frame will allow the owner to plant trees and other landscaping to ensure the survival of the plant material. Typically, installation of landscaping occurs in the spring or fall.

C.    Maintenance. Individual(s) whether as the owner, lessee, tenant, occupant or otherwise shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all landscaping materials. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance at all times.

Landscaping shall be kept visually free of insects and disease, and shall be kept free from weeds and other volunteer plants. Irrigation systems shall be maintained so as to eliminate water loss due to damaged, missing, or improperly operating sprinkler system components. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be removed or replaced within six months, or the next planting period (spring or fall), whichever comes first, while other defective landscaping features shall be removed, replaced or repaired within three months. Permanent, semi-permanent, and regular parking on landscaped areas is prohibited.

D.    Hazards. Landscaping shall be maintained to minimize property damage and public safety hazards, including the removal/replacement of dead or decaying plant material, removal of low hanging branches and those obstructing street lighting, sidewalks and traffic sight distance requirements. Trees planted in the public right-of-way must be selected from the city’s street tree selection guide. In the event a tree, shrub, or other plant causes damage to streets, sidewalks, trails, or other public improvements, the community development director and/or public works director or designee may order the removal of the offending vegetation and/or other landscape features.

E.    Vegetation Protection. Development plans must show all significant vegetation within twenty feet of any proposed new development. The applicant must protect all significant vegetation during any new development activity.

F.    Enforcement. Follow-up inspections and enforcement activities will be through the city’s code enforcement ACE program. (Ord. 6/20/2006O-8 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 11-13-2001 § 2 (part), 2001)


17-7-2.8 Parking.

A.    All residential lots shall provide a minimum of two improved off-street parking spaces for personal automobiles in a driveway, garage or carport, or in the side or rear yard. The driveway shall be paved with concrete or asphalt and shall have a maximum width of twenty feet, or forty percent of the lot frontage, whichever is greater. This measurement shall be taken at the drive approach and sidewalk. The paved driveway may extend an additional ten feet in width behind the sidewalk. Parking in the side or rear yard shall be improved with concrete, asphalt, concrete pavers or gravel. Parking areas surfaced with either concrete pavers or gravel must be maintained to ensure no weeds grow in these areas. With the exception of the driveway and approved side yard parking, no other portion of the front or side yards shall be surfaced or used for parking. At no time shall parking occur on any landscaped area. 

B.    Storage of individual recreational vehicles (RVs), travel trailers, boat trailers and utility trailers shall occur in an improved off-street location a minimum of five feet behind the sidewalk. No portion of the RV or trailer, or anything attached to the RV or trailer, shall extend closer than five feet to the sidewalk. This includes, but is not limited to, hitches. Parking in the side or rear yard shall be improved with concrete, asphalt, concrete pavers or gravel. Parking areas surfaced with either concrete pavers or gravel must be maintained to ensure that no weeds grow in these areas. With the exception of the driveway and approved side yard parking, no other portion of the front or side yards shall be surfaced or used for parking. At no time shall parking occur on any landscaped area.

C.    An applicant for new development shall propose on-site parking as follows:

Whip antennas are not allowed on a wall-mounted antenna structure. Antennas, equipment, and the supporting structures shall be selected to achieve the architectural compatibility with the host structure to which they are attached.

(A)    Stealth facilities shall be designed to substantially conceal and camouflage the antennas and associated equipment.

(1)    The planning commission shall review and may grant approval for any new antenna(s) that require construction of a new screening wall. New screening wall(s) shall be in harmony with the structure’s mass, architectural features, and overall aesthetics. Architectural and structural renderings, three-dimensional representation, line-of-sight diagrams, photo simulations, and/or building elevations of the proposed modifications may be required to effectively demonstrate the requested changes meeting the intent of this chapter.

(2)    Area Limitations for Stealth Wall-Mounted Antennas. The total area for all stealth wall-mounted antennas and supporting structures combined shall not exceed five percent of any exterior wall of the building. Stealth wall-mounted antennas may occupy a maximum of four walls. The total calculated area is the sum of each individual antenna and the visible portion of the supporting structure as viewed when looking directly at the face of the building.

(B)    Non-stealth facilities shall only be considered in locations in which adverse visual impacts are not a substantial concern due to the location of the facility, the nature of the surrounding land uses, and is not visible from public vantage points.

(1)    Area Limitations for Non-Stealth Wall-Mounted Antennas. The total area for all non-stealth wall-mounted antennas and supporting structures combined shall not exceed forty square feet for each exterior wall of the building or a total of one hundred sixty square feet per building. The total calculated area is the sum of each individual antenna and the visible portion of the supporting structure as viewed when looking directly at the face of the building.

ii.    Roof-Mounted Antenna. Two types of roof-mounted antennas are allowed: stealth-mounted and non-stealth-mounted. Antennas, equipment, and the supporting structures shall be selected to achieve the architectural compatibility with the host structure to which they are attached. Roof-mounted antennas are an allowed use only on a flat roof and shall be screened, constructed and painted to match the structure to which they are attached. The planning commission shall review and may grant approval to place roof-mounted stealth antennas on a pitched roof if the antenna(s) are compatible with the existing structure.

iv.    No validated complaints or violations concerning animals (unlicensed pets, excessive noise, bites, stray) have been recorded against the applicant by the city.

g.    Temporary Dwellings. The purpose of this subsection is to allow existing permanent dwellings to be occupied temporarily by the property owner while a new permanent dwelling is under construction on the same property. Because the need is transitory, the approval of temporary dwellings does not constitute a long-term land use commitment that conflicts with the comprehensive plan and implementing ordinances. Nothing in this subsection is intended to allow the use of mobile/modular homes, travel trailers/RVs, or any other living accommodation as a temporary dwelling. Temporary dwellings shall be regulated as follows:

i.    Every temporary dwelling authorized in accordance with this section shall meet the following minimum criteria:

(B)    Renewal. A request for renewal of a temporary dwelling permit issued shall be submitted at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the permit. A temporary dwelling permit may be renewed only once and for a term no longer than the term of the initial temporary dwelling permit.

(C)    Revocation. A permit issued under this section may be revoked if the city determines that:

(1)    Any of the requirements of this chapter have not been satisfied;

(2)    Any of the conditions attached to the permit have not been met; or

(3)    The grounds for authorizing the permit no longer exist.

The temporary dwelling permit may be revoked after notice to the holder of the permit. If the permit holder has not demonstrated to the city within seven days of the mailing of such notice that no grounds for revocation exist, then the permit may be revoked and the matter referred to the code enforcement officer for appropriate action pursuant to municipal code.

(D)    Expiration. Occupancy of a temporary dwelling shall cease immediately upon expiration of a temporary dwelling permit and within fourteen days after mailing, by certified mail, of notification of revocation. The temporary structure must be demolished within thirty days of expiration or revocation of the permit, or the city may commence demolition work in accordance with the signed agreement.

(E)    Transferability. A permit issued under this subsection is not transferable except to future owners of the same property, who must sign an affidavit agreeing to use the permit only under the same terms, time frames, conditions, responsibilities, and agreements that the original permit holder agreed to.

(F)    Certificates of Occupancy. No certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy shall be granted for the new dwelling unit until the temporary dwelling unit and any debris, junk or refuse has been removed from the property to the satisfaction of the city.

h.    Chickens. Subject to the requirements of this section and any other applicable provision of this code, hen chickens (and no roosters or other types of fowl) regardless of age, in the amount set forth below, may be kept on a lot or parcel of land for the sole purpose of producing eggs.

(B)    Lots with at least ten thousand square feet: up to five.

(C)    Lots with at least seven thousand square feet: up to three.

(D)    Lots with at least five thousand square feet: up to two.

(E)    Lots with less than five thousand square feet: none.

ii.    The principal use on the lot or parcel shall be a single-family dwelling.

iii.    Chickens shall be confined within a secure enclosure that includes a coop.

(A)    The coop shall be covered, weatherproof, and well ventilated.

(B)    The enclosure, including the coop, shall be predator-resistant.

(C)    The coop shall have a minimum floor area of at least two and one-half square feet per chicken.

The coop shall also meet the minimum setback for accessory structures within this zoning district. The coop and enclosure shall be hidden from the public view through the use of opaque fencing materials, vegetative screening, or other means allowed within this part. Because a corner lot technically does not include a rear yard, the owner of a corner lot may choose one of the “side” yards to function as a rear yard for the purposes of keeping chickens and locating the coop.

(F)    The coop and enclosure shall be maintained in a neat and sanitary condition and shall be cleaned as necessary to prevent any odor detectable at a property line. At a minimum the coop and enclosed area shall be cleaned weekly, although waste may be composted so long as the composting area meets the setback requirements that apply to the coop and prevent any odor detectable at the property line.

(G)    No chicken shall be permitted to roam outside the coop or enclosure.

iv.    Chicken feed shall be stored in rodent- and predator-proof containers.

v.    Water shall be available to the chickens at all times. A watering device that incorporates a water warming device shall be supplied, used and maintained.

(A)    Less than or equal to one-half acre in size: two colonies;

(B)    More than one-half acre in size: five colonies.

ii.    A site plan shall be submitted for review by the community development department addressing the following:

(A)    Any colony situated within twenty-five feet of a public or private property line shall require the establishment of a flyway barrier at least six feet in height consisting of a solid wall, fence, dense vegetation or combination thereof as approved by the community development department. Said barrier shall be parallel to the property line extending ten feet beyond the colony in each direction, forcing a flight pattern elevation of at least six feet above grade.

(B)    A water source shall be provided on the property and no nearer than twenty feet to the hive to avoid bees congregating on nearby properties in a search for water.

(C)    A sign conspicuously posted setting forth the name and phone number or other identifying marks, such as a registration number, of the responsible beekeeper.

iii.    In addition to the aforementioned conditions, the applicant shall ensure compliance at all times with the following conditions:

(A)    All honey bee colonies shall be kept in Langstroth-type hives with removable frames, which shall be kept in sound and usable condition.

(B)    All honey bee colonies shall be registered with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

(C)    Maintenance shall be such that no bee comb or other materials are left upon the grounds of the apiary site. Upon removal from the hive, all such materials shall promptly be disposed of in a sealed container or placed within a building or other bee-proof enclosure.

(D)    All colonies shall be maintained with marked queens. The colony shall be promptly requeened if it exhibits unusual aggressive characteristics by stinging or attempting to sting without due provocation or swarming. Regardless of colony behavior, each colony shall be requeened on a yearly basis.

(E)    Each Utah apiary shall meet all requirements and inspection schedules deemed necessary by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

(F)    Notwithstanding compliance with the various requirements of this subsection, it shall be unlawful for any beekeepers to keep any colony or colonies in such a manner or of such disposition as to cause any unhealthy condition, interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of human or animal life of others or interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of any public property or property of others.

Upon receipt of information that any colony situated within the city is not being kept in compliance with the conditions pursuant to the approved conditional use permit, an investigation and subsequent hearing before the city’s hearing officer per Chapter 8.05 and the appeal authority per Chapter 17-3 may result and may result in the revocation of the conditional use permit.

Applicants for new development and existing residential property owners shall comply with the following landscaping standards:

A.    Single Family and Duplex Required Landscaping/Vegetation Protection.

1.    Landscaping Required. Yard and setback areas visible from street access, including park-strips, that are not utilized as approved parking or access for vehicles, trailers, etc., shall be landscaped. Landscaping shall include the treatment of the ground surface with live materials such as, but not limited to sod, grass, ground cover, trees, shrubs, vines and other growing horticultural plant material. In addition, a combination of xeriscape plantings and designs that may include other decorative surfacing such as bark chips, crushed stone, mulch materials, decorative concrete or pavers shall also meet landscaping requirements. Structural features such as fountains, pools, statues, and benches shall also be considered part of the landscaping, but such objects alone shall not meet the requirements of landscaping.

2.    Installation Time Frame Requirements. Landscape materials must be installed within six months of occupancy/notice of violation. This shall apply to all new or existing residential structures that are in a blighted condition which do not comply with this chapter. This time frame will allow the owner to plant trees and other landscaping to ensure the survival of the plant material. Typically, installation of landscaping occurs in the spring or fall.

3.    Maintenance. Individual(s) whether as the owner, lessee, tenant, occupant or otherwise shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all landscaping materials. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance at all times. Landscaping shall be mowed, groomed, trimmed, pruned and watered according to water-wise conservation guidelines to maintain healthy growing conditions and not detract from the appearance of the immediate neighborhood. Landscaping shall be kept visually free of insects and disease, and shall be kept free from weeds and other volunteer plants. Irrigation systems shall be maintained so as to eliminate water loss due to damaged, missing, or improperly operating sprinkler system components. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be removed or replaced within six months, or the next planting period (spring or fall), whichever comes first; while other defective landscaping features shall be removed, replaced or repaired within three months. Permanent, semi-permanent, and regular parking on landscaped areas is prohibited.

4.    Hazards. Landscaping shall be maintained to minimize property damage and public safety hazards, including the removal/replacement of dead or decaying plant material, removal of low hanging branches and those obstructing street lighting, sidewalks and traffic sight distance requirements. Trees planted in the public right-of-way must be selected from the city’s street tree selection guide. In the event a tree, shrub, or other plant causes damage to streets, sidewalks, trails, or other public improvements, the community development director and/or public works director or designee may order the removal of the offending vegetation and/or other landscape features.

5.    Vegetation Protection. Development plans must show all significant vegetation within twenty feet of any proposed new development. The applicant must protect all significant vegetation during any new development activity.

6.    Enforcement. Follow-up inspections and enforcement activities will be through the city’s code enforcement ACE program.

B.    Multifamily Required Landscaping. All required landscaping shall be installed as a condition precedent to receiving a certificate of occupancy unless seasonal conditions make installation unfeasible, in which case the applicant shall provide cash security or its approved alternative for all landscaping, which landscaping shall be installed by the following May 31st.

1.    Minimum Landscaped Area. The applicant shall landscape at least fifteen percent of the proposed development area as interior landscaping. Landscaped areas shall not be less than five feet wide.

17-7-4.6 Landscaping.

Applicants for new development and existing residential property owners shall comply with the following landscaping standards:

A.    Single Family and Duplex Required Landscaping/Vegetation Protection.

1.    Landscaping Required. Yard and setback areas visible from street access, including park-strips, that are not utilized as approved parking or access for vehicles, trailers, etc., shall be landscaped. Landscaping shall include the treatment of the ground surface with live materials such as, but not limited to sod, grass, ground cover, trees, shrubs, vines and other growing horticultural plant material. In addition, a combination of xeriscape plantings and designs that may include other decorative surfacing such as bark chips, crushed stone, mulch materials, decorative concrete or pavers shall also meet landscaping requirements. Structural features such as fountains, pools, statues, and benches shall also be considered part of the landscaping, but such objects alone shall not meet the requirements of landscaping.

2.    Installation Time Frame Requirements. Landscape materials must be installed within six months of occupancy/notice of violation. This shall apply to all new or existing residential structures that are in a blighted condition which do not comply with this chapter. This time frame will allow the owner to plant trees and other landscaping to ensure the survival of the plant material. Typically, installation of landscaping occurs in the spring or fall.

3.    Maintenance. Individual(s) whether as the owner, lessee, tenant, occupant or otherwise shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all landscaping materials. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance at all times. Landscaping shall be mowed, groomed, trimmed, pruned and watered according to water-wise conservation guidelines to maintain healthy growing conditions and not detract from the appearance of the immediate neighborhood. Landscaping shall be kept visually free of insects and disease, and shall be kept free from weeds and other volunteer plants. Irrigation systems shall be maintained so as to eliminate water loss due to damaged, missing, or improperly operating sprinkler system components. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be removed or replaced within six months, or the next planting period (spring or fall), whichever comes first; while other defective landscaping features shall be removed, replaced or repaired within three months. Permanent, semi-permanent, and regular parking on landscaped areas is prohibited.

4.    Hazards. Landscaping shall be maintained to minimize property damage and public safety hazards, including the removal/replacement of dead or decaying plant material, removal of low hanging branches and those obstructing street lighting, sidewalks and traffic sight distance requirements. Trees planted in the public right-of-way must be selected from the city’s street tree selection guide. In the event a tree, shrub, or other plant causes damage to streets, sidewalks, trails, or other public improvements, the community development director and/or public works director or designee may order the removal of the offending vegetation and/or other landscape features.

5.    Vegetation Protection. Development plans must show all significant vegetation within twenty feet of any proposed new development. The applicant must protect all significant vegetation during any new development activity.

6.    Enforcement. Follow-up inspections and enforcement activities will be through the city’s code enforcement ACE program.

B.    Multifamily Required Landscaping. All required landscaping shall be installed as a condition precedent to receiving a certificate of occupancy unless seasonal conditions make installation unfeasible, in which case the applicant shall provide cash security or its approved alternative for all landscaping, which landscaping shall be installed by the following May 31st.

1.    Minimum Landscaped Area. The applicant shall landscape twenty percent of the interior of the proposed development area. Landscaped areas shall not be less than five feet wide. Building foundation landscaping is not interior landscaping. The applicant must landscape a minimum of ten feet between the side yard and the abutting property line when the side or rear yards are in public view.

2.    Building Foundation Landscaping. The ground adjacent to the building foundation must be landscaped if it is visible from public vantage points.

3.    Plant Materials. Areas requiring landscaping shall be planted with substantial live plant material including: plants, shrubs, trees, sod, etc., for the purpose of buffering, screening, and improving the visual quality of the site.

a.    Types of Vegetation. At least twenty-five percent of the landscaping must be evergreen. Up to twenty-five percent of the landscape area can include specialty paving, street furniture, and outdoor seating areas. Trees that are planted in the park strip shall meet the specifications described in the standard construction specifications of Midvale City.

b.    Size of Trees. The following standards apply to the use of plant and tree material:

i.    Deciduous Trees. All deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper size of two inches.

ii.    Ornamental Trees. All ornamental trees shall have a minimum caliper size of one and one-half inches.

iii.    Evergreen Trees. All evergreen trees shall have a minimum height of six feet.

4.    Criteria for Reduced Landscaping. To encourage design excellence, the community and economic development director may decrease the minimum landscaped area, upon the following criteria:

a.    Professionally designed landscaping, designs of special merit, xeriscaping and preserving existing mature, “healthy,” and desirable tree species are highly encouraged and considered in an applicant’s request to reduce required landscaping.

b.    The community and economic development director may grant a reduction of an applicant’s landscape requirement by a total of up to twenty-five percent upon an applicant’s demonstration of the criteria listed below:

i.    Professionally Designed Landscaping. Up to ten percent if the applicant implements a landscaping plan designed and prepared by a licensed landscape architect.

ii.    Landscape Designs of Special Merit. Up to twenty percent if the overall landscape design is of special design merit. Special design merit is interpreted to include but not be limited to such things as utilizing unique or rare plant species, civic art such as sculpture, and features using recycled water.

Monopoles shall be fenced with a six-foot chain-link fence and the climbing pegs removed from the lower twenty feet of the monopole. In circumstances where the accessory building and fence may be viewable from any public road or public space, the planning commission may require alternative building and fencing materials such as masonry, wrought iron or chain link with colored vinyl coating, depending on the location.

(F)    No monopole or lattice tower may be located within one thousand feet of another monopole or lattice tower unless it is for the bona fide public services of a public transit district as defined in Section 17A-2-1001 et seq. of the Utah Code Annotated and as certified by said public transit district.

v.    Review Criteria. Each applicant for a telecommunications facility must demonstrate:

(A)    Compatibility of the proposed structure with the height and mass of existing adjacent buildings and utility structures;

(B)    Whether co-location of the antenna on other existing structures in the same vicinity such as other towers, buildings, utility poles and similar structures is possible without significantly affecting antenna transmission or reception;

(C)    The location of the antenna in relation to existing vegetation, topography and buildings to optimize visual screening;

(D)    Whether the spacing between monopoles creates detrimental impact upon adjacent properties;

(E)    The location of the pole in relation to noteworthy structures, landmarks and pedestrian or automotive transportation view corridors;

(F)    Location and zoning compliance of accessory buildings associated with the telecommunications facility;

(G)    Monopole. A conditional use permit for a monopole may be granted in a residential zone district only if the planning commission finds that:

(1)    The monopole antenna does not exceed thirty-five feet in height;

(2)    Monopole with antennas and antennas support structure does not exceed two feet in width;

(3)    The antenna tower will be placed on a parcel, which is not occupied by a residential use, such as a school, church, or other nonresidential use, which is otherwise legally located in that residential zone;

(4)    The antenna tower will be located no closer than two hundred feet from the nearest residential structure; and

(5)    The monopole will be disguised as, or otherwise integrated with, a light pole or similar utility structure located on the parcel to minimize and mitigate the visual impact of the antenna. Monopoles shall be fenced with a six-foot chain-link fence and the climbing pegs removed from the lower twenty feet of the monopole. In circumstances where the accessory building and fence may be viewable from any public road or public space, the planning commission may require alternative building and fencing materials such as masonry, wrought iron or chain link with colored vinyl coating, depending on the location.

(6)    No monopole or lattice tower may be located within one thousand feet of another monopole or lattice tower unless it is for the bona fide public services of a public transit district as defined in Section 17A-2-1001 et seq. of the Utah Code Annotated and as certified by said public transit district.

A fee shall be paid for said permit for each newspaper or ad stand as provided in Resolution 02/26/02C. The permit shall be valid for one calendar year. A substitution of newspaper or ad stands shall not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee if the newspaper or ad stand is placed in the same location as originally permitted.

e.    Revocation and Removal. The issuance of a permit to locate a newspaper or ad stand within the city of Midvale creates only a license, revocable upon a showing of cause by the city, and shall create no permanent rights of any kind. Each newspaper or ad stand must be removed within fourteen days of written notification. Newspaper or ad stands not moved within the fourteen-day period will be removed by the city at the owner’s expense. Removal expense per stand shall be calculated based on using a two-man crew and one truck for one hour.

17-7-5.9    Related provisions.


17-7-5.1 Purpose.

This chapter is established to provide a zone that allows a mix of specific land uses that are typically found separately in “mutually exclusive” zoning districts. Mixed-use represents a departure from traditional zoning to the extent that it encourages a combination of land uses which might normally be regarded as incompatible. The intent of this zone is to create self-sustaining areas within the community that become traditional neighborhoods, in which residents may walk to work, to shopping, to transit and to recreational facilities. These neighborhoods should provide:

A.    A variety of housing opportunities and choices that include a range of household types, family sizes, and incomes;

B.    Streetscape treatments that include pedestrian-friendly features such as build-to lines, rear lot parking for shared uses, wide sidewalks and boulevards to separate pedestrians from vehicles;

C.    Pedestrian lighting that is smaller in scale than typical street lighting, street furnishings, such as benches, drinking fountains, sculpture and trash receptacles located in conjunction with transit stops;

D.    Large street trees that provide a canopy and shade to reduce the perception of an otherwise broad street width;

E.    Bicycle racks and improved, sheltered transit stops with lighting and other amenities;

F.    Convenient pedestrian-oriented commercial services; and

G.    Enhanced employment opportunities.

Standards for the zone include requirements that help provide a true “neighborhood” by encouraging a mix of uses, parking concealment, and long-term maintenance. This zone is intended to be used in conjunction with area-specific overlay zones which address build-to lines, compact building design, preservation of open space, pedestrian friendly streets and streetscape, and building materials, colors and form control. Developments proposed with increased land use intensity and housing density, but without the above pedestrian-oriented elements, are unacceptable and will not be approved. (Ord. 11-20-2001 § 2 (part), 2001)


17-7-5.2 Uses.

A.    Additional Use-Specific Standards.

1.    Medical Cannabis Pharmacy.

a.    Proximity Restrictions.

i.    A medical cannabis pharmacy use shall meet the proximity requirements as specified and amended in Section 26-61a-301 of the Utah Code Annotated.

b.    Application Requirements.

i.    An applicant for a medical cannabis pharmacy use must provide a description of the physical characteristics of the proposed facility, including a site plan, floor plan, architectural elevations, and a security plan as part of the business license application for the use. Fencing and security devices must comply with applicable city requirements.

ii.    When proximity restrictions include area in an adjacent municipality, an applicant for a medical cannabis pharmacy use shall obtain a letter from the adjacent municipality indicating proximity restrictions within this title are satisfied based on existing uses in the area in the adjacent municipality prior to issuance of a business license.

c.    Parking. A medical cannabis pharmacy use shall be considered a retail and service commercial personal service use for the purpose of calculating parking requirements.

d.    Signage. In addition to those requirements within this title, all signage associated with a medical cannabis pharmacy use shall comply with any requirements imposed by the state of Utah. (Ord. 2020-02 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2016-15 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2012-08 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 5/5/2009O-8 § 1 (Att. A) (part), 2009; Ord. 8/10/2004O-25 § 1(7) (part), 2004: Ord. 3-19-2002A § 1(2), 2002; Ord. 11-20-2001 § 2 (part), 2001)


17-7-5.3 Lot and development standards.

All new subdivision and mixed-use development within the zone shall be subject to the lot and development standards of its associated overlay zone. Master plan approval is a condition precedent to all new subdivision and mixed-use development in the mixed-use zone. (Ord. 11-20-2001 § 2 (part), 2001)


17-7-5.4 Master planned development criteria and application.

Regardless of the size and ownership of individual parcels, an applicant for any new subdivision, or any new development or redevelopment, which includes mixed-uses must submit and obtain a mixed-use master planned development permit as a condition precedent to subdivision or development. The plan must include sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposal fully mitigates all of its off-site impacts including: traffic, parking, stormwater, noise, glare, vibration, odor, and public and pedestrian safety and that it comports with the lot, development and architectural design criteria of its respective overlay zone.

A.    Location Restrictions. Mixed-use developments shall be located in areas where pedestrian-oriented components (i.e., housing choices, convenience commercial, employment, community facilities, transportation linkages, park or other open space, schools, churches) are already present or planned, or where the size and scale of development is such that said components can be provided within the project itself. The planning commission shall evaluate proposals for mixed-use developments based on the following criteria:

1.    The mix and interaction of uses proposed (i.e., convenience commercial and housing with transit);

2.    Pedestrian level amenities (i.e., pathways and paseos, benches, etc.);

3.    Linkages to surrounding neighborhoods and developments.

B.    Mixed-Use Master Plan Application. At a minimum, the mixed-use master plan must include the following information:

1.    Site Plan of Projected Development. A site plan depicting all parcels within the applicant’s control, including remnant parcels left from old developments, existing parcels or pads within existing center developments, and the existing and reasonably projected development on adjoining properties, determined through consultation with adjoining property owners. The proposed development must include an assemblage of parcels of sufficient area to assure compliance with required building setbacks, landscaping, access, off-street parking requirements, and walkability standards for the proposed development to assure a consistent overall mixed-use development with uniform and compatible site standards upon buildout.

2.    Site Design. A site plan depicting proposed building placement, massing and uses consistent with the area specific overlay zone ordinance.

3.    Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED). The plan must demonstrate how CPTED principles will be used in the design and layout of buildings, streets, accesses and open space areas. Design shall promote natural surveillance, access control, territorial reinforcement, sense of ownership, and maintenance. CPTED landscaping guidelines shall be used, including planting shrubs with a maximum height of three feet and trees with a proper ground clearance of six feet above walkways and sidewalks and eight feet above vehicular travel and parking lanes. To encourage public safety through natural surveillance, natural access control, and territorial reinforcement, blank walls are not permitted adjacent to streets, pedestrian areas, and open space amenities. Symbolic barriers, such as low-lying fences/walls, landscaping and signage shall be used to discourage crime and to promote safety. Ground floor parking garages shall not be permitted immediately adjacent to streets. Developments shall have street side building elevations with extensive windows, and with balconies, decks or landscape terraces encouraged.

4.    Visual Buffer Plan. A plan for visual buffers to protect adjacent residential uses. Within the proposed development, landscaped buffers are preferred over fences and walls. A visually open look is encouraged between compatible uses. Visual screening which creates “outdoor rooms” is often more important than a physical separation. If fences or walls are proposed, the plan must demonstrate how fences or walls will protect private space while not impeding “walkability,” or creating isolated uses or dead space void of natural surveillance. Fences or walls must be compatible in color, texture, and design with proposed buildings.

5.    Aesthetically Pleasing Design From All Vantage Points. Elevations consistent with the overlay zone, that depict building mass, materials and exterior appurtenances and facades which create an aesthetically pleasing building and site, from all vantage points, that is in character with, and proportionate to, surrounding buildings and yet provides diversity in design.

6.    Remodel. Plans for significant exterior modifications to any existing structures must be submitted to the planning commission for approval and must meet the same requirements as all other structures within the mixed-use zone.

7.    Open Space Plan. An open space plan showing open spaces, including but not limited to: commons, pocket parks, plazas, courtyards, landscape features, water fountains and features, greenbelts, and trail connections. “Village greens,” as a commons area, may be required adjacent to mass transit connections or other significant activity. Building materials used within open space areas shall be related to the materials of adjacent buildings and walkable surfaces shall be a non-skid finish. Design shall encourage comfortable and safe pedestrian use, including landscaping, seating areas, and lighting as appropriate.

8.    Steep Slope and Stormwater Plan. A plan, which depicts drainages, steep slopes and water features, if any, and how they will be preserved or enhanced.

9.    Landscape/Streetscape Plan. A site-wide landscape and streetscape plan consistent with CPTED principles and the applicable area overlay zone ordinance.

10.    Lighting Plan. A plan which shows proposed street, parking lot, open space and pedestrian way lighting in sufficient detail to demonstrate conformance with the standards established in the applicable area overlay zone ordinance.

11.    Street, Trails, and Pedestrian Way Plan. A plan that depicts the design and placement of streets, trails, and pedestrian ways consistent with city standards and the overlay zone.

12.    Parking and Circulation Plan. A plan which demonstrates the provision for, and layout of, safe, convenient, screened parking and vehicular circulation patterns which complement the:

a.    Type of land use and structure;

b.    Building height and configuration;

c.    Relationship to other buildings both horizontally and vertically;

d.    Natural land features such as slopes and vegetation;

e.    Physical features such as rail lines, canals, and controlled ingress and egress;

f.    Proposed transit shelters;

g.    Visibility from vehicular approaches and distant highways;

h.    Safe pedestrian connections to buildings, walkways, open space, and streets;

i.    Parking planned in “outdoor rooms” or larger lots softened by substantial tree and ground cover;

j.    Shared parking and access; and

k.    Proposed on-street parking, if any. (Ord. 11-20-2001 § 2 (part), 2001)


17-7-5.5 Mixed-use master planned development permit—Required findings of fact.

Based upon written findings of fact, the planning commission shall approve, reject, or approve with conditions each complete application for a mixed-use master planned development.

A.    Written Findings. The planning commission shall approve a mixed-use master planned development permit application only upon its issuance of a written finding that the:

1.    Application complies in all respects with this code;

2.    Use will be compatible in all respects with surrounding structures, uses, and circulation, based on the twelve criteria detailed in subsection B of this section;

3.    Use is consistent with the general plan; and

4.    Off-site effects of the use have been fully mitigated.

B.    Criteria. In reviewing the mixed-use master planned development application, the planning commission shall consider the following criteria:

1.    Site Context and Constraints. The size and location of the site and its surrounding uses, compared to the intensity of the proposed size and location of structures and the intensity of the proposed uses;

2.    Traffic. Ease of on and off-site traffic circulation;

3.    Pedestrian-Friendly Design. The extent to which the design and use promotes a pedestrian-friendly “walkable” environment;

4.    Screening. Any proposed screening of the use. Mechanical equipment must be screened from streets, pedestrian areas, and adjacent developments. Screens shall be incorporated into the design of the building in an aesthetically pleasing manner, whether located on the ground or on the roof;

5.    Compatibility/Multi-Faceted Design. Physical design and compatibility with surrounding structures. All sides of proposed buildings will receive equal design consideration, particularly where exposed to pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic and adjacent properties;

6.    Off-Site Impacts. Noise, vibration, odors, steam, or mechanical factors that might affect neighbors and/or pedestrians;

7.    Delivery and Service. Control of delivery and service vehicles, loading and unloading zones and screening of trash receptacles;

8.    Maintenance. An overall maintenance schedule shall be implemented by property owners and/or property associations in maintaining all buildings, parking lots, roads, drainage, pavement, open spaces, courtyards, landscaping, fences, walls, drives, etc.;

9.    Street Tree/Street Light Coordination. Actual tree spacing during site plan review may be adjusted, as necessary, to match existing streetscape or to adapt to unique on-site conditions that would justify such, e.g., topography, street lights, power lines and poles, and other utilities. In some cases, street trees may need to be placed behind sidewalks or eliminated in order to accommodate on-site conditions. Park strips on arterial and collector streets should accommodate street trees, streetlights, and other needed utilities. Street trees should be placed such that the street lighting system functions properly and achieves the desired result;

10.    Service Areas. Loading and refuse collection areas must be screened from public view. These areas are not permitted in the area between buildings and streets unless they can be adequately screened through landscaping and/or walls less than four feet in height, as viewed by the public. Building and improvements upon lots must be designed to properly accommodate loading, unloading and refuse collection on-site. Screen walls and enclosures shall be constructed with materials compatible with the structures they serve. Loading and refuse collection areas shall be properly maintained in a debris-free condition. Except for approved and screened R.V. storage lots associated with a residential use, storage areas, including the storage of materials, merchandise, pallets, etc., shall be within buildings; and

11.    Grading and Drainage. Drainage from any lot must follow current city requirements. Drainage shall not be allowed to flow upon adjoining lots unless the owner of the lot upon which the water flows grants an irrevocable easement for such purpose. A site plan with grading, drainage, and clearing plans must be approved by the city engineer before any such activities may begin. Lot grading shall be kept to a minimum. Where possible, roads and development shall be designed for preservation of natural grade. (Ord. 11-20-2001 § 2 (part), 2001)

Benches and shelters installed by the Utah Transit Authority or other public agencies shall be exempt from the payment of a fee. A change in the text of the sign for the bench or shelter or a substitution of benches or shelters shall not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee if the bench or shelter is placed in the same location as originally permitted.

g.    Revocation and Removal. The issuance of a permit to locate a bench or shelter within the city of Midvale creates only a license, revocable upon a showing of cause by the city, and shall create no permanent rights of any kind. Each bench or shelter must be removed within fourteen days of written notification. Benches or shelters not moved within the fourteen-day period will be removed by the city at the owner’s expense.

A substitution of newspaper or ad stands shall not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee if the newspaper or ad stand is placed in the same location as originally permitted.

e.    Revocation and Removal. The issuance of a permit to locate a newspaper or ad stand within the city of Midvale creates only a license, revocable upon a showing of cause by the city, and shall create no permanent rights of any kind. Each newspaper or ad stand must be removed within fourteen days of written notification. Newspaper or ad stands not moved within the fourteen-day period will be removed by the city at the owner’s expense.

17-7-7.4 Lot and development standards.

The following development standards apply to all new development in the zone:

A.    Setbacks. New development shall comply with the following setbacks:

1.    Front. The minimum front yard setback is fifteen feet, which shall consist of a ten-foot wide sidewalk, a five-foot park strip, and tree wells, subject to the following exceptions:

a.    Corner Lot Rule. Corner lots have two front yards, with a twenty-five foot setback.

b.    Projections. Skylights, sills, cornices, chimneys, flues and ornamental features may project into the front yard up to two and one-half feet. Eaves and awnings may project into the front yard up to eight feet so long as the eaves or awnings are at least eight feet above ground.

2.    Side. There is no side setback requirement, except as required by the International Building Code and landscape buffers.

3.    Rear. There is no rear setback requirement, except as required by the International Building Code and landscape buffers. 

B.    Build-To Line. The front yard setback is the build-to line. At least fifty percent of the front facade must be built within three feet of the build-to line on all interior lots and at least thirty percent of the front facade must be built within three feet of the build-to line on all corner lots. Recessed plazas, courtyards and trellises are encouraged.

C.    Height. The maximum height for a structure is fifty-five feet for a sloped roof or fifty-two feet for a flat roof, and may extend up to seventy-five feet for a sloped roof or seventy-two feet for a flat roof for portions of the structure more than fifty feet from a single family residential zoning district.

D.    Building Orientation. The entrances of all buildings shall front onto public streets. However the entrances of anchor stores greater than ten thousand square feet in size may orient to a pedestrian plaza. Structures on corner lots shall provide an entrance on each street frontage. Anchor store entrances must be connected to adjacent streets via landscaped, lighted, publicly accessible walkways. Access from parking areas may be via lighted, mid-block passageways or “paseos,” to the street. Secondary entries may be placed at the rear of street-facing buildings.

E.    Maximum Footprint. No structure in a mixed-use development shall have a footprint in excess of twenty thousand square feet.

F.    Coverage. Buildings may cover up to eighty percent of the lot area.

G.    Access Management. All new development and an expansion by more than twenty-five percent of an existing building mass or site size shall comply with the following access management standards:

1.    All driveways and curb cuts shall be installed according to the standards and specifications contained in the Midvale City Construction Standards and Specifications handbook. Curb cuts for pedestrian access shall orient toward each street frontage.

2.    All newly installed driveways for commercial uses shall be a minimum of two hundred feet apart. The city engineer may allow exceptions when required by the built environment or by other safety considerations. In no instance shall the city engineer authorize the installation of a driveway within one hundred twenty-five feet of a major intersection.

3.    All newly installed driveways for commercial uses shall align with any existing commercial access across the street. The planning commission may allow deviations to the requirement, provided the city engineer finds the driveway to be acceptable based on but not limited to access placement, traffic generated, and pedestrian and vehicular circulation.

4.    New development or conversion of an existing residential use to a commercial use shall not propose parking in such a way that users may be allowed to back onto public rights-of-way.

5.    Existing nonconforming driveways within the zone shall be retired upon construction of a new building or the expansion of the area of an existing building or site by twenty-five percent or more.

6.    Shared driveways between and among parcels are encouraged and allowed if the parties execute and record an easement, or a deed of dedication, in a form approved by the city attorney to ensure access in perpetuity for both parcels.

H.    Except for ordinary repairs and maintenance of lighting approved and installed after January 2, 2002, all new development must comply with the following outdoor lighting standards:

1.    Light Source. Light sources shall be at least as efficient as LED and no greater than four thousand K in correlated color temperature (CCT). Light levels shall be designed such that light trespass measured at the property line does not exceed 0.01 foot-candles. Light fixtures shall use a cutoff luminaire that is fully or partially shielded with no light distributed above the horizontal plane of the luminaire or into nearby residential structures. In no case shall the total lumens emitted for a single site exceed one hundred thousand lumens per acre.

2.    Parking Lot Lighting. Parking lot lighting shall be designed and constructed to comply with the following standards:

a.    Pole Height/Design.

i.    Luminaire mounting height is measured from the parking lot or driveway surface and may range from ten feet to thirty feet, based on review of site plan, proposed land uses, surrounding land uses, parking area size, building mass, topography of site, and impacts on adjacent properties.

ii.    Poles and fixtures shall be black, dark brown, or another neutral color approved by the community development director.

iii.    All attempts shall be made to place the base of light poles within landscape areas.

iv.    Light poles in parking areas shall not exceed thirty feet in height. Poles exceeding twenty feet in height are appropriate only for parking areas exceeding two hundred stalls and not in close proximity to residential areas.

3.    Other Outdoor Lighting Standards.

a.    Wall-mounted lighting fixtures shall not be located above eighteen feet in height unless being used as building accent lighting. Fixture styles and finishes shall complement the building exterior.

b.    Lighting located along pedestrian pathways or in areas primarily dedicated to human activity shall be bollard style lighting or down-directed lighting not to exceed twelve feet in height. Pedestrian lighting shall be coordinated through each project and shall complement adjacent projects to the greatest extent practical.

c.    In order to avoid light pollution, backlit awnings, up-light spotlights, and floodlights are prohibited.

d.    Street lighting shall either be chosen from the city’s approved streetlight list or installed to match a theme set by developments within the zone or neighborhood.

4.    Upgrading Preexisting Lighting. An applicant must bring preexisting lighting into compliance with this code upon application with the business license department for a change in ownership, new business in a stand-alone structure or in a multi-tenant structure in which the new business utilizes more than fifty percent of the building square footage on the site, in conjunction with an application for a building permit for any alteration, remodel or expansion of any structure on the site, or in conjunction with changes to the approved site plan.

5.    Lighting Plan Submission Requirements. A lighting plan is required for all developments and must contain the following:

a.    Plans indicating the location on the premises, and the type of illumination devices, fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors, installation and electrical details;

17-7-8.6 Retail, office and mixed-use architectural standards.

All new development must present an attractive, coordinated streetscape; incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale; incorporate interior pedestrian access between structures to minimize pedestrian travel through parking areas; and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians by constructing pedestrian crossings with stamped, dyed, or raised walks. All new development shall comply with the following architectural standards:

A.    New Building Form. Structures shall be designed to relate to grade conditions with a minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls. The design shall create easy pedestrian access from adjacent uses, on-street parking, sidewalks and parking areas. Commercial buildings shall be designed with ground floor architectural separation to enhance street activity and “walkability.” All proposed building designs must incorporate an expansive use of windows, balconies, terraces, arcades or other design features, which are oriented to the street and other pedestrian accesses, to maximize the pedestrian interface. Windows, display windows and doors must comprise at least forty percent of street-facing facades on the commercial developments with first-floor commercial uses. Blank facades are not allowed to face public rights-of-way and may not exceed thirty feet in length on all other facades.

B.    Walls. No more than three materials shall be used for primary wall surfaces. All exterior walls shall be constructed in compliance with the following:

1.    Materials. Exterior finishes shall be of traditional, time- and weather-tested techniques and shall include a substantial use of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, prairie stone, and/or wood or synthetic wood products. Glazing may be used as a primary exterior material when glazing is proposed as a major architectural design element or look for a project area consisting of at least two buildings and including all of the buildings that are separated by a major feature such as a linear park, collector street, or similar element that sets an area apart. Retaining and screening walls shall be of materials complementary to the building’s materials.

2.    Stucco. The use of stucco, synthetic stucco and EIFS should be limited and shall not exceed fifty percent of any elevation. The planning commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the architectural detail and excellence of a structure is such that the use of stucco in excess of this standard is warranted.

3.    Other Architectural Materials/Finishes. Architectural precast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, and architectural metals should be used primarily to provide architectural detail and relief. Fiberglass and/or metal panels may be used in relatively small quantities. The planning commission may allow other materials and material quantities that it finds add to the architectural excellence of the structure and project.

4.    Prohibited Materials. Vinyl and aluminum siding products are prohibited as wall materials.

5.    Base Materials. Each structure shall have a base or foundation with a minimum height of one-third the overall height of the structure. The base or foundation shall extend beyond the plane of the wall above it, creating a larger mass at the base of the building. The planning commission may allow for minor deviations to allow this base to terminate at visual breaks in the architecture, and the planning commission may approve alternative materials that are the qualitative equivalent of brick, cultured brick, or natural or cultured stone.

6.    Brick and Rock Pattern. Ledge stone, uncoursed ledge rock, random or coursed ashlar Flemish bond, English bond, common bond, running bond or drystack patterns shall be used for finished brick, rock and stone work. Herringbone, basketweave, vertical stack, stack bond, uncoursed roughly squared, and other vertical, irregular, or diagonal masonry patterns or vertical, nonalternating bond courses may be used only as an accent. Other masonry patterns shall not be used on vertical surfaces except as expressly authorized by the planning commission.

7.    Color Scheme. Buildings shall use a cohesive palette of colors which complement nearby buildings. Without limiting the use of color, large areas of walls shall be subdued in color and not reflective. Intense colors should be used as accent only.

8.    Design Consistency. All exposed sides of a building shall be designed with the same level of care, quality and integrity. Buildings should be attractive and visually engaging from all exposed sides.

C.    Roofs. Roof lines and shapes shall be consistent with the design and structure of the building, and should be consistent with the roof lines of adjacent buildings. Roof forms should reflect the facade articulation and building massing, as opposed to a single-mass roof over an articulated facade.

17-7-9.1 Purpose.

This chapter provides standards for land development within the Bingham Junction zone (BJ zone). The entire BJ zone property will be planned as a large scale master planned development, in accordance with this chapter, prior to any new development on the property. Approval of a small scale master planned development, in accordance with this chapter, will also be a condition precedent to any new development within the BJ zone. Generally, the BJ zone encourages a dynamic mix of uses, which includes three use categories: residential, urban (retail/office flex), and mixed-use. Based on the clustering and increased densities allowed as part of the Bingham Junction zone standard, the large scale master plan shall include at no cost to the city a dedication of twenty percent of the real property to be improved later as open space and linked trails. This master planning process is designed to guide development of the elements of a functioning, sustainable community in a manner consistent with specific environmental conditions associated with the site. All new development that occurs within the BJ zone is subject to institutional control plans, as approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and the city of Midvale. In the BJ zone, new development shall, to the extent relevant:

A.    Address environmental conditions at the site through adherence to applicable institutional controls governing (among other things) materials management, cover and barrier maintenance and replacement, surface water management, and so forth;

B.    Include variations in architectural design and housing types and affordability that have direct access to open space or parklands; 

C.    Implement a project, which joins new construction with the overall Midvale community in a thoughtful and constructive way;

D.    Coordinate a mix of sustainable uses and development that complement housing and commerce opportunities and that are compatible with adjacent historic neighborhoods; 

E.    Include landscaping to provide a distinctive visual quality to the area;

F.    Include multi-modal transportation links including the two-hundred-foot-wide Bingham Junction Boulevard;

G.    Provide significant, functional, improved open space, including the Jordan River Ecological Park along the east bank of the Jordan River; and

H.    Provide pedestrian connections within and among developments and between adjacent neighborhoods. (Ord. 9/21/2004O-29 § 1 (part), 2004)


17-7-9.2 Planning and zoning process. 

Approval by the city and any property owners’ association (POA) of large and small scale master plans is a condition precedent to any new development of the site. The planning and zoning process applicable to any new development within the BJ zone shall be as follows:

A.    Large Scale Master Plan Criteria. The large scale master plan approved in conjunction with the BJ zone (as amended) shall run with the land and shall govern the city’s approval or denial of subsequent development plans related to any new development at the site. The large scale master plan provides for a development that creates a dynamic and sustainable community using development areas which support urban, residential and/or mixed-use land planning. For purposes of planning and zoning, the property within the BJ zone has been classified in six subareas (numbered 1 through 6), as depicted on Appendix A which is on file in the city recorder’s office. In addition to the criteria set forth in Section 17-3-5, specific criteria applicable to the large scale master plan are as follows: 

1.    Minimum/Maximum Densities. Development within the BJ zone shall be entitled to densities in each subarea as follows:

	Densities	Subarea 1	Subarea 2	Subarea 3	Subarea 4	Subarea 5	Subarea 6

	Residential, Single Fam. Detached: Minimum DU/Ac*	4 DU/Ac	5 DU/Ac	5 DU/Ac	5 DU/Ac	 	 

	Residential, Single Fam. Detached: Maximum DU/Ac	13 DU/Ac	13 DU/Ac	15 DU/Ac	15 DU/Ac	 	 

	Residential, Single Fam. Detached: Minimum lot size 

Min. Width: 30 ft.	2,800 SF 

 

•	2,800 SF 

 

•	2,500 SF 

 

•	2,500 SF 

 

•	 	 

	Residential, Single Fam. Attached (townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, etc.): Maximum DU/Ac	 	24 DU/Ac	24 DU/Ac	24 DU/Ac	24 DU/Ac	24 DU/Ac

	Residential, Multi-Family: Maximum DU/Ac	 	30 DU/Ac	30 DU/Ac	30 DU/Ac	30 DU/Ac	30 DU/Ac

	Nonresidential, Mixed-Use: Maximum FAR**	1.5 FAR	1.5 FAR	1.5 FAR	1.5 FAR	1.5 FAR	1.5 FAR

	Mixed-Use, Maximum FAR**	 	 	 	 	0.8 Min. FAR

3.0 FAR	2.0 FAR

*    DU/Ac.: Dwelling units per acre: number of dwelling units divided by the total acreage of the development.

**    FAR: Gross floor area ratio for nonresidential uses and accessory structures, inclusive of nonleasable enclosed space, but exclusive of below grade inhabitable and/or unoccupied space, and exclusive of covered parking areas and parking structures, divided by the land area of a lot or parcel.

2.    Improved Open Space/Trails. The large scale master plan includes, at no cost to the city, dedication of real property to be utilized as improved open space in a usable and accessible manner. The dedication is based on the clustering and increased densities allowed as part of the Bingham Junction zone standard. The allocations for cost of and requirements related to the development of specific improvements to open space and trail linkages shall be developed as part of the large scale master plan, small scale master plan and related development agreements.

3.    Jordan River Park. The large scale master plan includes an improved public park along the east bank of the Jordan River. The park includes trail connections from each of the use districts, which provide links throughout the BJ zone to the park.

4.    Bingham Junction Boulevard. The large scale master plan includes the owner’s commitment in the first development phase to dedicate the two-hundred-foot-wide Bingham Junction Boulevard along the general alignment shown in the plan.

5.    Institutional Controls. The large scale master plan will demonstrate that it is in conformance with applicable institutional controls.

B.    Small Scale Master Plan. Each small scale master plan must be accompanied by a current letter of approval from the applicable POA at each step of the city’s review and approval process prior to submission to the planning staff, planning commission and the city council. Each small scale master plan application must be consistent with the large scale master plan, the common development standards set forth in Section 17-7-9.5, and must include the following elements: 

1.    Zoning Plan. The BJ zone (as amended) does not include detailed provisions regarding certain standards and guidelines but adopts a series of goals and intent statements, as set forth in Section 17-7-9.4 (Common intent statements). The zoning plan will include proposed, detailed standards and guidelines (in ordinance format) governing the development that implement the goals of the large scale master plan and the applicable intent statements. Once approved, the zoning plan shall be incorporated into and adopted as part of the BJ zone. The proposed standards and guidelines shall address the following issues:

a.    Land use standards establishing land use types, occupancy, location, density, buffering and any other element envisioned by the large scale master plan;

b.    Lot standards establishing requirements for minimum lot area, depth, coverage, and dimensions;

c.    Building setback standards for front, side and rear yards;

d.    Design standards addressing building orientation and mass, common and private open space, natural resource protection, architectural design including colors and materials, and any other provisions proposed to be included in the zone;

e.    Landscaping and buffering standards; and

f.    Parking lot design standards (including lighting).

2.    Development Plan. The small scale master plan shall include a schematic development plan showing the following:

a.    Location of proposed uses, including dwelling unit density and occupancy;

b.    Height, location, bulk and preliminary elevations of buildings;

c.    Location, arrangement and configuration of open space, landscaping, and building setbacks;

d.    Location, access points, and design of off-street parking areas;

e.    Number, size and location of signs;

f.    Street layout, and traffic and pedestrian circulation patterns, including proposed access to the property to adjoining and nearby properties and uses.

3.    Development Agreement. A development agreement, in a form satisfactory to the city attorney and city council, wherein the owner agrees to comply with the provisions of the conditional use permit for the master planned development and provides security, to the satisfaction of the city attorney and city council, for all on- and off-site public improvements associated with the development.

4.    Open Space. The small scale master plan will include (a) a detailed description of how the relevant open space areas shown on the large scale master plan will be implemented (improved and dedicated, as applicable); and (b) how the open space areas will be linked to the overall open space system identified in the large scale master plan. The dedication is based on the clustering and increased densities allowed as part of the Bingham Junction zone standard. The allocations for cost of and requirements related to the development of specific improvements to open space and trail linkages shall be developed as part of the large scale master plan, small scale master plan and related development agreements. 

5.    Institutional Controls. The small scale master plan will demonstrate that it is in conformance with applicable institutional controls.

C.    Subdivision, Site Plans, Building Permits. Subdivision of land within the BJ zone may occur prior to, after, or in conjunction with approval of the applicable small scale master plan. Subdivision, site and project plans, and building permits within the BJ zone shall be in accordance with the current Building Code, the common development standards set forth in Section 17-7-9.5, this chapter, and Section 17-7-3 and Title 16 of the Midvale City Code. Each subdivision plat, site and project plan, and building permit application must be accompanied by a current letter of approval from the applicable POA at each step of the city’s review and approval process prior to submission to the planning staff, planning commission and the city council.

F.    Exterior Structure. All exterior walls of all structures shall be constructed in compliance with the following: 

1.    All buildings shall use one or more of the following durable materials as significant finish: architectural pre-cast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, brick cladding, natural and cast stone, architectural metals, and glazing. Architectural site-cast concrete may be allowed if designed, articulated, and colored for a finished appearance on all buildings. At least fifty percent of all buildings visible from 7200 South shall be composed of brick, stone, architecturally treated CMU, and/or architectural pre-cast concrete. 

2.    High standards for exterior materials, exterior building systems, and their application are expected. In particular, the design, and application of EIFS or synthetic stucco is expected to be of a high enough quality to allow for crisp detailing and substantial relief. The use of EIFS on ground floor walls shall be limited to the surface area three or more feet above finished grade. The wall area from finished grade to where the use of EIFS begins shall be clad by a hard, durable material such as brick, stone, architectural pre-cast concrete, or architecturally treated concrete masonry units.

3.    Buildings shall provide variation in the form of facades that adjoin streets. Variations should result from significant dimensional changes in plane, color or detail as accomplished by such devices as protruding bays, recessed entries, upper level step-backs, arcades, offsets in the general plane of the facade, changes in materials or color, bay windows, vestibules, porches, balconies, exterior shading devices, nonretractable canopies or awnings, projecting cornices, or eaves.

4.    Primary public entry(s) shall be architecturally emphasized so that pedestrians can easily find them.

5.    Use awnings, canopies, arcades or other architectural features to reduce glare on storefront glass and to shelter the pedestrians standing near the storefront. Cantilever awnings and canopies from the building face so as to keep sidewalks as clear and unobstructed as possible.

6.    Drive-through windows shall be located at the side or rear of buildings. While not desirable, a drive aisle may be located between the building and the street so long as its width is minimized, any pedestrian crossings of it are clearly delineated with special paving treatments, no parking spaces occur off of it and a low wall, railing with landscaping, or a continuous hedge at least three feet high exists between stacked cars and the sidewalk.

7.    Opaque (solid) storefront security closures (rolling doors, etc.) are not allowed.

8.    Weather Protection. Weather protection features such as awnings, canopies, doors inset by at least three feet, or arcades shall be provided at all customer entrances.

9.    Facade Features. All large retail building facades visible from public streets shall include architectural treatments that add detail, character, and reduce the appearance of massive blank walls. Techniques such as color and material changes, expression of structure, shifts in plane, offsets and projections, belt courses, reveals, pilasters, windows, doors, arcades, canopies, and other similar elements may achieve this standard.

10.    Parapets. Large building roofs shall have parapets and enclosures concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment from public view. Parapet and enclosure materials shall match the building in quality and detail.

11.    Building Orientation. Building facades that face the street but do not have pedestrian entries shall be composed of high quality materials such as brick or stone, and shall provide variety and interest in the facade through the introduction of such elements as pilasters, recessed or protruding bays, changes in materials and/or colors, building lighting elements, display windows with products or product graphics, transparent windows or clerestories, and well-designed signs and graphics. Service areas, mechanical equipment, meters and trash containers shall be completely screened from the street.

12.    Entryways. Each large retail building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring a combination of several elements such as:

a.    Canopies, awnings or porticos.

b.    Projecting eaves and cornices.

c.    Recesses/projections of wall surfaces.

d.    Arcades.

e.    Raised parapets over the door.

f.    Peaked roof forms.

g.    Lighting features.

h.    Entry plazas.

i.    Display windows.

j.    Architectural details such as masonry tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure and design.

k.    Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaping.

l.    Signs integrated with the building architecture.

G.    Openings. The following standards apply to openings of all structures: 

1.    Entry Doors. Entry doors must face the front yard or, if located on the building side, must be placed within three feet of the front facade. Entry doors must be covered by a roof and must be a primary element of the front of the structure.

2.    Windows. Bay windows shall have from three to five sides.

3.    Corner Buildings. Special attention shall be given to corner buildings that are highly visible, that may serve as landmarks, and provide a sense of enclosure at intersections. Special attention can be achieved by architecture, landscape, and public place.

H.    Reserved.

I.    Screening. Trash collection and recycling areas, service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall be screened on all sides so that no portion of such areas are visible from public streets and alleys and adjacent properties. Required screening may include, new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof. 

1.    For nonresidential and mixed-use structures, all roof-mounted mechanical and electrical equipment, communication antennas or dishes shall be screened from the view of a pedestrian at the far side of adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less, or designed and/or located as part of the overall architectural design.

2.    For residential structures, roof-top mechanical equipment, vents, flues, fans and other pieces of equipment shall be screened and/or organized to leave sloped roofs as simple and uncluttered as possible, or, where roofs are flat, to be screened from view of a pedestrian at the far side of the adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less. Where such appurtenances are visible, they shall be painted a color that matches the roof color or other architectural features so that their visual impact is minimized. 

3.    Refuse containers shall be screened from view on all sides. Screen walls and fences shall be one foot higher than the object to be screened. An opaque gate shall be included where required to complete screening.

4.    Loading docks and/or service areas shall be located to the side or rear of buildings. Where they are directly visible from streets, and nearby residential buildings, they shall be screened by walls at least eight feet high, or densely and continuously massed landscaping that maintains its screening capabilities in the winter. Raised planters, berms or other land forms may also be used in conjunction with landscaping or walls. A combination of dense, continuous landscaping and walls may allow the use of lower walls, but no lower than four feet high from finished grade. (Ord. 2019-06 § 1 (Att. B) (part); Ord. 2016-15 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2015-01 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 8/1/2006O-12 § 1 (part), 2006) 


17-7-9.12.1.9 Trails and open space.

A.    Provide a continuous trail system throughout Bingham Junction, connecting it to the regional trails and bikeways serving the site such as the Jordan River. Sidewalks may be considered as trail linkages if pedestrians and bicyclists are separated and the dual-use sidewalk has at least a clear width of eight feet.

B.    Public access shall be provided to all open space, directly from the public street/sidewalk system or through off-street pedestrian and/or bicycle paths. (Ord. 8/1/2006O-12 § 1 (part), 2006)


17-7-9.12.1.10 Streets and alleys.

A.    All local streets, whether public or private, shall provide a detached sidewalk at least five feet wide, a planting strip between the sidewalk and the back of curb at least eight feet wide, and street trees. The tree requirement shall be calculated at one tree per forty feet of frontage, either grouped or spaced at reasonable intervals, where allowed by the institutional controls. 

B.    The number and width of curb cuts shall be minimized on residential and commercial streets so as to reduce the number of conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. Driveways to individual residential garages shall not be wider than sixteen feet at property line, and should not be closer than twenty-five feet apart. Driveways providing access to single family attached units shall be separated by a minimum landscaped area of five feet in width.

C.    Where a local or collector street is bordered by ground floor commercial uses with shop fronts oriented to the street, the planting strip may be replaced by at least a five-foot wide hard surface amenity zone with street trees in grates or cut-outs where allowed by the institutional controls. Other street furniture such as waste baskets, bicycle racks, pedestrian lights, and newspaper boxes may be located within this amenity zone. The sidewalk should be wide enough to provide at least five feet of width for a walking zone and at least a five-foot wide zone next to the shop fronts for window shopping, sidewalk cafes, and the temporary display of goods.

D.    Local and collector streets shall be designed to accommodate the minimum widths for travel lanes and on-street parking lanes.

E.    Parallel on-street parking should be encouraged on all local and collector streets. Diagonal and head-in parking off of local or collector streets shall be used only in commercial or mixed-use areas, not in residential areas.

F.    Surface parking areas shall be screened by low perimeter landscaping, walls or railings to minimize the impact of vehicles and headlights onto adjoining residential structures and streets.

G.    Pedestrians shall be buffered from the travel lane next to the curb by at least an eight-foot planting strip with street trees no more than forty feet on center apart where allowed by the institutional controls, or by at least a five-foot amenity zone between back of curb and walking zone with street trees in grates or planted cut-outs. Where feasible, on-street parallel parking is also encouraged to provide additional buffering to the pedestrian environment, and pedestrian activity on the street.

1.    Minimum Number of Models for Single Family Detached, Attached, or Other Multi-Family Residential Unit Combinations That Appear to Be a Single Large House. Any development of fifty or more units in any of the above-listed configurations shall have at least three different types of housing models. Any development of fewer than fifty units of the above-listed configurations shall have at least two different types of housing models.

2.    Minimum Model Characteristics for Single Family Detached, Attached, or Other Multi-Family Residential Unit Combinations That Appear to Be a Single Large House. Each housing model shall have at least three characteristics, which clearly and obviously distinguish it from the other housing models, such as different floor plans, exterior materials and colors, roof shapes, garage placement, window size/proportion/pattern, placement of the footprint on the lot, and/or overall building facade design.

3.    Street-Accessed Garages. Only a maximum of fifty percent of street-accessed garages shall have garage doors facing the street with the balance being alternative side or rear-loaded and/or detached rear yard garages, etc., except that all opposing block faces shall duplicate the opposite side of the street; only front driveway block faces will face each other, only alley-loaded block faces will face each other. Each such alternatively loaded garage plan will constitute a distinct model for the purposes here.

4.    Single Family Attached (Townhouse). The development of contiguous townhouses is limited to fifty units (i.e., in any single location) and in groupings no larger than eight units each. Any additional development over fifty townhouses may be developed so long as one-third of the total approved units are located on uncontiguous lots, a minimum of one hundred fifty feet or three lots apart in all directions and in groupings no larger than eight units each. Any townhouse development larger than eight units shall provide at least two different unit models. Each unit model shall have at least three characteristics that clearly distinguish it from the other townhouse models.

J.    Medium and High Density Residential Architectural Requirements.

1.    Residential Architectural Standards. All new residential development must present an attractive streetscape, incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale, and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. All new residential development shall comply with the general architectural standards for the Junction at Midvale zone and with each of the following architectural standards:

a.    Materials. All single family detached, attached, or other multi-family residential units, including combinations that appear to be a single large house, shall include a substantial use of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, wood or synthetic wood products.

b.    Base Materials. Each structure shall have a base or foundation with a minimum height of one-third the overall height of the structure. The base or foundation shall extend beyond the plane of the wall above it, creating a larger mass at the base of the building. The planning commission may allow for minor deviations to allow this base to terminate at visual breaks in the architecture, and the planning commission may approve alternative materials that are the qualitative equivalent of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone.

c.    Brick and Rock Pattern. Ledge stone, uncoursed ledge rock, random or coursed Ashlar Flemish bond, English bond, common bond, running bond or drystack patterns shall be used for finished brick, rock and stone work. Herringbone, basket weave, vertical stack, stack bond, uncoursed roughly squared, and other vertical, irregular, or diagonal masonry patterns or vertical, nonalternating bond courses may be used only as an accent. Other masonry patterns shall not be used on vertical surfaces except as expressly authorized by the planning commission.

d.    Stucco. The use of stucco should be limited to architectural relief and shall not exceed twenty-five percent of a front elevation or fifty percent of any elevation. The planning commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the architectural detail and excellence of a structure is such that the use of stucco in excess of this standard is warranted.

e.    Prohibited Materials. Vinyl and aluminum siding products are prohibited as wall materials. 

f.    Color Scheme. The use of a single color scheme, minimal detailing, or blank (or largely blank) walls is not permitted. The use of exterior staircases is discouraged.

g.    Building Massing. Buildings that are uniformly three stories or more must step the roof form or interrupt it with other roof elements. The building mass of the elevation can be reduced by off-setting dwelling units, and varying building setbacks and heights.

h.    Openings. Not less than twenty-five percent of any front or rear building face shall be made up of window or door areas. Not less than fifteen percent of any side building face shall be made up of windows or door areas unless an adjacent building within twenty feet of that side face obscures the majority of that side face from public view.

i.    Protruding Features. Bay windows and other architectural elements protruding from the facades may be clad in other materials.

j.    Miscellaneous. Security devices shall have materials and colors that complement the building’s architecture and building materials. Accessory structures shall be architecturally compatible with the primary development. Satellite dishes should be placed on the roof of a building, should be wired for use during construction, and shall not be placed within the public view or on the first floor of any building.

2.    Roof Form. Roof forms shall be designed in ways and/or used in combinations to break up large, continuous building forms, particularly for cluster and multiple dwelling structures. Where flat roofs are used, other techniques to provide scale and interest shall be used to refine large, continuous building forms. Long unbroken ridge or parapet lines are prohibited.

a.    Generally, for structures lower than forty feet high, gable or hip roofs are preferred for the primary roof form. The primary gable roof slope shall not be less than five to twelve and not less than six to twelve for single family or duplex residences.

b.    Secondary roof structures such as porch roofs, roofs over bay extensions, bay windows, etc., may include other roof forms such as shed roofs, and hip roofs in combination with gable roofs. However, the secondary roofs shall be consistent or complementary with the primary roof form. Secondary roofs that slope should not be less than four to twelve. Flat roofs may be also appropriate for small areas.

3.    Front Entry Feature. All dwelling units or residential buildings shall have an exterior entry that is a prominent, architectural focal point directing people into the unit or building. This feature shall relate to the architecture of the structure and may include porches, stoops, roofs, etc.

4.    Garages. Garage doors must be set back a minimum of twenty feet from the property line or sidewalk, whichever is greater, if off-street parking is to occur in the driveway. In all cases where garage doors face a street, the garage door shall be recessed a minimum of two feet behind the front line of the building living area (porches, bay windows, and similar projections not included). The style, materials, colors and roofs used in the construction of accessory structures, including garages and carports, shall be architecturally compatible with the primary structures. 

K.    City-Wide Utility Infrastructure. Each project and each structure within each project shall include infrastructure that facilitates connection to Questar Gas, Rocky Mountain Power, Comcast Cable, UTOPIA, and Qwest Communications. This requirement may be waived if any of the aforementioned utilities decline, in writing, the opportunity to install or utilize the necessary infrastructure. The director of community and economic development and authorized deputies may approve the waiver. (Ord. 2016-15 § 15 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2011-14 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh.

1.    Front. The minimum front yard setback shall be fifty feet along Bingham Junction Boulevard and thirty feet along 7200 South 700 West, Junction View Drive, FLSmidth Drive, and other interior roads. This setback shall be improved in one of the two following ways:

a.    A sidewalk and amenity zone of at least ten feet (five-foot sidewalk and five-foot amenity zone) in width to include:

i.    Tree wells, street lighting and planter boxes per the adopted thematic elements;

ii.    Street furniture, to include benches, trash cans and bollard lighting per the adopted thematic elements; or

b.    An eight-foot-wide meandering concrete pedestrian path set no closer than five feet to the road and integrated into the overall landscaping for the area (to include a variety of rock and bark mulches) to include:

i.    Street trees and street lighting per the adopted thematic elements;

ii.    Street furniture to include benches, trash cans and bollard lighting per the adopted thematic elements.

c.    Corner Lot Rule. Corner lots have two front yards and two side yards.

d.    Projections. When integrated into a courtyard or plaza area, eaves, awnings and ornamental features may project into the front yard up to eight feet.

e.    All roads north of the UTA Trax line shall utilize a landscaped setback in accordance with Section 17-7-9.12.2.8(A)(3).

2.    Rear. The rear yard setback shall be of sufficient depth to allow proper parking and landscaped areas to the rear of the buildings. Unless otherwise approved as a conditional use by the planning commission, rear yards and the rear of buildings shall not abut a public street. On corner lots there is no rear yard. In the case of lots that abut the Jordan River, a sixty-five-foot landscaped setback along the Jordan River from the top of bank, or the one-hundred-year flood plain, whichever is greater, shall be provided. And in the case of lots that abut the light rail corridor, a thirty-foot landscape setback shall be provided. These setbacks shall be landscaped consistent with the adopted landscape plans for the river and linear park open space areas south of the Trax line and provided with an eight-foot-wide asphalt pedestrian path.

3.    Side. There is no side yard setback for mixed-use, retail, office or flex development except as required by the International Building Code. In the case of lots that abut the Jordan River, a sixty-five-foot landscaped setback along the Jordan River from the top of bank, or the one-hundred-year flood plain, whichever is greater, shall be provided. And in the case of lots that abut the light rail corridor, a thirty-foot landscape setback shall be provided. These setbacks shall be landscaped consistent with the adopted landscape plans for the river and linear park open space areas south of the Trax line and provided with an eight-foot-wide asphalt pedestrian path.

4.    Setback requirements notwithstanding, when a retail/office/flex or mixed-use structure is located within an area that is identified by the master plan as a predominately residential area, or when a structure is located adjacent to or on a street where residential structures are the dominant use, the setback shall be the same as that required for the dominant use on that block.

C.    Build-To Line. The front setback line is the build-to line. All retail/office/flex and mixed-use structures located in Subareas 2, 3, and 5 shall address adjacent streets by being constructed at the front yard setback, which is the build-to line. At least fifty percent of the front elevation must be built at the build-to line on all interior lots and at least thirty percent of the front elevation must be built at the build-to line on all corner lots. Recessed plazas, courtyards and trellises are encouraged.

1.    Exceptions.

a.    The applicant may increase the depth of the build-to line by up to fifteen feet if the variation is used to promote a pedestrian-oriented use, e.g., special landscaping, public plazas, outside seating for a restaurant, etc.

b.    When a retail/office/flex or mixed-use structure is located within an area that is identified by the master plan as a predominately residential area, or when a structure is located adjacent to or on a street where residential structures are the dominant use, the build-to line shall be the same as that required for the dominant use on that block.

c.    When one owner or lessee occupies more than one hundred twenty thousand square feet of interior tenant space on one contiguous parcel or site, exclusive parking for handicapped, visitor and/or visiting executives may be provided for between the right-of-way and the front building elevation so long as they are signed accordingly. The maximum number of visitor and/or visiting executive parking stalls allowed in this area will be calculated by multiplying the square footage of the building by 0.0166 percent. Handicap stalls required in this area to meet building code are allowed in addition to this number, and will not count against the number calculated above. In allowing parking within the front setback, the following must be provided to minimize the visual impact of the parking from the public way and continue to focus on the pedestrian nature of the area between the public way and the front entrance of the building:

i.    The parking area shall be constructed using specialty paving (stamped and/or dyed concrete or pavers, etc.) and be designed to provide a visual link between the pedestrian way and the building entrance, identifying the area as primarily pedestrian in nature;

ii.    Public plazas or building entry features shall be visually and physically extended into the parking area to provide for further enhancement of the pedestrian experience;

iii.    The depth of the parking area shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible;

iv.    The parking area cannot encroach into any portion of required public open space.

D.    Height. The maximum height for the zone is seven stories. If a structure is constructed within fifty feet of a single family detached residential structure, the maximum height shall not be constructed in excess of one story higher than the nearest adjacent residential building.

E.    Building Orientation and Scale. Retail/office/flex and mixed-use structures shall be oriented and scaled as follows:

1.    Structures shall be serviced by a local street, an access road or drive, or an alley and shall not gain access from a collector or arterial street except as approved by the city engineer. Structures that front a courtyard, paseo, or common open space/recreation area are encouraged.

2.    Buildings shall be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and of buildings and to minimize road area.

3.    Ground floor pedestrian entrances must be oriented toward adjacent streets, plazas, courtyards, sidewalks and trails.

4.    Buildings shall be designed to minimize pedestrian and automobile conflict while providing pedestrians direct access to a sidewalk or trail.

5.    Massing should be divided into rhythmic blocks to bring the design of the unit much closer to the human scale and to create a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.

6.    Long building rows without varying setbacks or building mass should be avoided to prevent wind tunneling and long-term shadow casting.

7.    Building planes shall incorporate varying heights, textures, shapes or colors to mitigate the visual impact buildings have on the public realm.

8.    Building design and orientation should consider exposure to sunlight to avoid energy inefficiencies.

9.    Gathering areas in central areas and between buildings shall be encouraged. These areas shall be designed, through landscaping, hardscape, outdoor furniture, and public art, among others, to create a conducive atmosphere for people to come together.

F.    City-Wide Utility Infrastructure. Each project and each structure within each project shall include infrastructure that facilitates connection to Questar Gas, Rocky Mountain Power, Comcast Cable, UTOPIA, and Qwest Communications. This requirement may be waived if any of the aforementioned utilities decline, in writing, the opportunity to install or utilize the necessary infrastructure. The director of community and economic development and authorized designee may approve the waiver. (Ord. 2014-09 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2011-06 § 1 (Att. A) (part): Ord. 8/25/2009O-13 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2009; Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)


17-7-9.12.2.7 Retail/office/flex and mixed-use architectural standards.

All new development must present an attractive, coordinated streetscape, incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. All new development shall comply with the following architectural standards:

A.     Walls. No more than three materials shall be used for primary wall surfaces.

1.    Materials. Exterior finishes shall be of traditional, time- and weather-tested techniques and shall include a substantial use of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, prairie stone, and/or wood or synthetic wood products. Glazing may be used as a primary exterior material when glazing is proposed as a major architectural design element or look for a project area consisting of at least two buildings and including all of the buildings that are separated by a major feature such as a linear park, collector street, or similar element that sets an area apart. Retaining and screening walls shall be of materials complementary to the building’s materials. 

2.    Stucco. The use of stucco, synthetic stucco and EIFS should be limited and shall not exceed fifty percent of any elevation. The planning commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the architectural detail and excellence of a structure is such that the use of stucco in excess of this standard is warranted.

3.    Other Architectural Materials/Finishes. Architectural pre-cast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, and architectural metals should be used primarily to provide architectural detail and relief. Fiberglass and/or metal panels may be used in relatively small quantities. The planning commission may allow other materials and material quantities that it finds add to the architectural excellence of the structure and project.

4.    Prohibited Materials. Vinyl and aluminum siding products are prohibited as wall materials. 

5.    Base Materials. Each structure shall have a base or foundation material of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone. This base or foundation shall be a minimum height of one-third the overall height of the structure. The base or foundation shall extend beyond the plane of the wall above it, creating a larger mass at the base of the building. The planning commission may allow for minor deviations to allow this base to terminate at visual breaks in the architecture or when the one-third base height overshadows the rest of the building architecture, specifically in single-story structures. The planning commission may approve alternative materials that are the qualitative equivalent of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, provided the alternative material conveys a sense of quality and detail that lends itself to the overall building design, ages gracefully and requires little maintenance.

6.    Brick and Rock Pattern. Ledge stone, uncoursed ledge rock, random or coursed Ashlar Flemish bond, English bond, common bond, running bond or drystack patterns shall be used for finished brick, rock and stone work. Herringbone, basket weave, vertical stack, stack bond, uncoursed roughly squared, and other vertical, irregular, or diagonal masonry patterns or vertical, nonalternating bond courses may be used only as an accent. Other masonry patterns shall not be used on vertical surfaces except as expressly authorized by the planning commission.

7.    Color Scheme. Buildings shall use a cohesive palette of colors which complement nearby buildings. Without limiting the use of color, large areas of walls shall be subdued in color and not reflective. Intense colors should be used as accent only.

8.    Design Consistency. All exposed sides of a building shall be designed with the same level of care, quality and integrity. Buildings should be attractive and visually engaging from all exposed sides. 

B.     Roofs. Roof lines and shapes shall be consistent with the design and structure of the building, and should be consistent with the roof lines of adjacent buildings. Roof forms should reflect the facade articulation and building massing, as opposed to a single-mass roof over an articulated facade.

1.    Pitched roofs. Where pitched roofs are used the following standards shall apply:

a.    All the roofs and secondary roofs of a building shall be constructed of the same material. All metal roofs must be of a subdued color. Painted roof shingles are prohibited.

b.    Slopes of roofs shall be of equal pitch if a gable or hip roof is employed. Roof forms shall be designed in ways and/or used in combinations to break up large, continuous building forms, particularly for structures that are wider than they are tall. Long unbroken ridgelines are prohibited.

2.    Parapets. Parapets shall be provided to articulate flat roofs and hide roof-mounted equipment. The following standards shall apply:

a.    Parapets shall have strong cornice detailing to provide interest and scale.

b.    Long unbroken parapets, particularly for buildings that are wider than they are tall, are prohibited.

3.    Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be hidden from view from the adjoining street with either a parapet or a penthouse. Penthouses shall utilize materials, colors and form similar to that of the building.

C.    Fences, Hedges, and Walls. Fences, hedges and walls should be used on a limited basis, and only where determined necessary to screen or buffer the incompatible or unsightly elements of a project such as loading areas and trash pick up areas, among others, or as required for specific athletic facilities. The following standards apply to new development of fences, hedges and walls:

1.     Required Setbacks. A fence, hedge, wall, column, pier, post, or any similar structure or any combination of such structures is permitted in the required setback of a zone district if it meets the following conditions:

a.     All fences and walls meet the requirements of Title 15 of this code, Buildings and Construction;

b.     No fence, hedge, or wall extends beyond or across a property line without a recorded agreement with the abutting property owner;

c.     Reserved;

d.     Only one fence or wall shall be allowed per property line. Double fences, walls or combination thereof are prohibited; and

e.     No barbed wire or other sharp, pointed, or electrically charged fence may be erected or maintained, except a temporary fence on a construction site to protect the property during the period of construction may be topped with barbed wire where the barbed wire is not less than eight feet above the ground and does not extend more than two feet above the temporary fence.

2.    Height. No fence structures may exceed seven feet in height except as needed for screening purposes in accordance with subsection (I) of this section. Fence height shall be measured as follows:

a.     In a required yard abutting a street, the total effective height above the finished grade measured on the side nearest the street;

b.     In any other required yard, the total effective height above the finished grade measured on the side nearest the abutting property;

c.     On a property line, measured from the finished grade of either side when the abutting property owners are in agreement; and

d.     A temporary fence on a construction site may be as high as required to protect the property during the period of construction.

3.     Athletic Facilities. Fencing around athletic facilities, including, without limitation, tennis courts, may be fourteen feet in height so long as all portions above six feet are constructed with at least fifty percent non-opaque materials.

4.    Conformance with This Section. No person shall construct, alter, or maintain a fence, hedge, wall, column, pier, post, or any similar structure or any combination of such structures except in conformance with all of the requirements of this section.

D.    Reserved.

E.    Miscellaneous. Security devices shall have materials and colors that complement the building’s architecture and building materials. Accessory structures shall be architecturally compatible with the primary development. Satellite dishes shall not be placed in view from the front yards.

F.     Exterior Structure. All exterior walls of all structures shall be constructed in compliance with the following:

1.    Finishes. All buildings shall use one or more of the following durable materials as significant finish: architectural pre-cast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, brick cladding, natural and cast stone, prairie stone, architectural metals, and glazing. Architectural site-cast concrete may be allowed if designed, articulated, and colored for a finished appearance on all buildings. At least fifty percent of all buildings visible from a major thoroughfare shall be composed of brick, stone, architecturally treated CMU, architectural pre-cast concrete and/or glazing.

2.    Quality. High standards for exterior materials, exterior building systems, and their application are expected. In particular, the design and application of EIFS or synthetic stucco is expected to be of a high enough quality to allow for crisp detailing and substantial relief. The wall area from finished grade to where the use of EIFS begins shall be clad by a hard, durable material such as brick, stone, architectural pre-cast concrete, or architecturally treated concrete masonry units.

3.    Form Variations. Buildings shall provide variation in the form of facades that adjoin streets. Street-facing facades shall make use of at least two of the following variations. Secondary facades shall make use of at least one of the following variations. Variations should result from significant dimensional changes in plane, color or detail as accomplished by such devices as:

k.    A distinguished upper floor for buildings with at least four floors; or

l.    Any other treatment the planning commission may approve that meets the intent of this section. Primary public entry(s) shall be architecturally emphasized so that pedestrians can easily find them.

6.    Storefronts. Awnings, canopies, arcades or other architectural features should be used to reduce glare on storefront glass and to shelter the pedestrians standing near the storefront. Cantilever awnings and canopies from the building face so as to keep sidewalks as clear and unobstructed as possible. The planning commission may permit limited use of supporting columns as part of a thematic design or corporate standard so long as the columns do not hinder pedestrian traffic or access.

7.    Drive-Through Windows. Drive-through windows shall be located at the side or rear of buildings. While not desirable, a drive aisle may be located between the building and the street so long as its width is minimized, any pedestrian crossings of it are clearly delineated with special paving treatments, no parking spaces occur off of it and a low wall, railing with landscaping, or continuous hedge at least three feet high between stacked cars and the sidewalk.

8.    Opaque (solid) storefront security closures (rolling doors, etc.) are not allowed.

9.    Weather Protection. Weather protection features such as awnings, canopies, doors inset by at least three feet, or arcades shall be provided at all customer entrances.

10.    Entryways. Each large retail building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring a combination of several elements such as:

a.    Canopies, awnings or porticos;

b.    Projecting eaves and cornices;

k.    Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaping;

l.    Signs integrated with the building architecture.

11.    Secondary Facades. Building facades that face the street but do not have pedestrian entries shall be composed of high quality materials such as brick or stone, and shall provide variety and interest in the facade through the introduction of such elements as pilasters, recessed or protruding bays, changes in materials and/or colors, building lighting elements, display windows with products or product graphics, transparent windows or clerestories, and well-designed signs and graphics.

G.    Openings. The following standards apply to openings of all structures:

1.    Entry Doors. Entry doors must be covered by a roof and must be a primary element of the front of the structure.

2.    Windows. Bay windows shall have from three to five sides.

3.    Corner Buildings. Special attention shall be given to corner buildings that are highly visible, that may serve as landmarks and provide a sense of enclosure at intersections. Special attention can be achieved by architecture, landscape, and public place.

4.    Minimum Opening Area. Not less than twenty-five percent of any street-facing building facade shall be made up of window or door areas. Not less than fifteen percent of any other building face on a third or higher story shall be made up of windows, balconies or other opening areas unless an adjacent building within twenty feet of that side face obscures the majority of that side face from public view. The planning commission may allow for a reduction to the minimum opening requirement if the applicant can demonstrate the building floor plan(s) required by the use cannot effectively accommodate the requirement and other architectural elements are used to (a) create visually interesting facades, (b) avoid large areas of blank facades, and (c) provide a human scale and details. Uses that may qualify for this reduction may include warehouses and uses which lend themselves to a more residential character, i.e., residential care facilities and hotels/motels. This provision may also be applied to portions of buildings with three street frontages to accommodate kitchens, restrooms and other utility areas.

H.    Reserved.

I.     Screening. Trash collection and recycling areas, service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall be screened on all sides so that no portion of such areas are visible from major transportation thoroughfares and adjacent properties. Required screening may include new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof. 

1.    For nonresidential and mixed-use structures, all roof-mounted mechanical and electrical equipment, communication antennas or dishes shall be screened from the view of a pedestrian at the far side of adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less, or designed and/or located as part of the overall architectural design.

2.    For residential structures, roof-top mechanical equipment, vents, flues, fans and other pieces of equipment shall be screened and/or organized to leave sloped roofs as simple and uncluttered as possible, or, where roofs are flat, to be screened from view of a pedestrian at the far side of the adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less. Where such appurtenances are visible, they shall be painted a color that matches the roof color or other architectural features so that their visual impact is minimized. 

3.    Refuse containers shall be screened from view on all sides. Screen walls and fences shall be one foot higher than the object to be screened. An opaque gate shall be included where required to complete screening.

4.    Loading docks and/or service areas shall be located to the side or rear of buildings. Where they are directly visible from streets and nearby residential buildings, they shall be screened by walls at least eight feet high, or densely and continuously massed landscaping that maintains its screening capabilities in the winter. Raised planters, berms or other landforms may also be used in conjunction with landscaping or walls. A combination of dense, continuous landscaping and walls may allow the use of lower walls, but no lower than four feet high from finished grade. (Ord. 2019-06 § 1 (Att. B) (part); Ord. 2016-15 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2012-10 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)


17-7-9.12.2.8 Retail/office/flex and mixed-use landscaping.

The following landscaping standards apply to all new development in the retail/office/flex and mixed-use land use areas:

A.    Required Landscaping. The applicant shall professionally landscape the lot, according to an approved landscape plan, as a condition precedent to receiving a certificate of occupancy for all commercial uses. The community development director shall evaluate landscape plans for all permitted uses. The planning commission shall evaluate landscape plans for conditional uses. Landscape plan approval is a condition precedent to issuance of a building permit for the parcel. All landscaping shall be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, unless seasonal conditions make installation unfeasible, in which case the applicant shall provide cash security or its approved alternative for all landscaping yet to be completed, which landscaping shall be installed by the following May 31st.

1.    Physical Connections. Each lot shall have a system of pedestrian walkways and sidewalks that provide connections between the building entrances, neighboring building entrances, sidewalks, parking areas, open space and public trails.

2.    Minimum Landscaped Area. Thirteen percent of the interior area of each retail/office/flex or mixed-use lot shall be developed as landscaped setbacks, courtyards, plazas, open space or walkways. The interior area does not include the landscaped setback(s) from the edge of the public right(s)-of-way as described in subsection (A)(3) of this section.

3.    Landscaped Setback from Edge of Public Right-of-Way. The landscaped setback from the edge of Bingham Junction Boulevard shall be fifty feet from the back of the curb; from 7200 South 700 West, Junction View Drive, FLSmidth Drive and other interior roads the landscaped setback shall be thirty feet. This setback shall not be in addition to the dedicated open space parcels along 7200 South identified as Parcels F, G, and I on the adopted Bingham Junction Open Space Exhibit. Courtyard or plaza areas may encroach into the front setback, provided they are integrated with the overall theme of the landscape setback (Figure 2). All setbacks that incorporate linear trails and amenities as part of the overall trails master plan shall be provided with an easement for public use to be recorded against the property.

4.    Screening. Maintenance buildings, trash collection and recycling areas, storage and service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall not be permitted in the front setback of any building and shall be located behind the main building structure, or completely screened from public view.

5.    Building Foundation Landscaping. The ground adjacent to the building foundation must be landscaped if it is visible from public vantage points.

6.    Jordan River Landscaped Setback. The minimum landscaped setback from the Jordan River shall be no less than sixty-five feet from the top of bank or the one-hundred-year flood plain, whichever is greater. Integration of an eight-foot-wide asphalt pedestrian path running parallel to the river shall be provided within this setback. To provide public access to the Jordan River from the east, pedestrian pathways shall be provided either through or around the perimeter of the parcel being developed. All setbacks that incorporate linear trails and amenities as part of the overall trails master plan shall be provided with an easement for public use to be recorded against the property.

7.    Residential Buffer. A landscaped buffer shall be required to separate residential uses from commercial and industrial uses as follows:

a.    Single Family Detached Landscaped Buffer Area. The landscape buffer area must be a minimum of thirty feet wide to provide adequate screening, buffering, and separation of these uses from single family detached residential uses. The landscape treatment should use a combination of distance and low level screening to separate the uses to soften the visual impact of the commercial or industrial use. The thirty-foot buffer area may be shared between adjoining properties, upon adequate proof of reciprocal easements to preserve and maintain the buffer area. The landscaped buffer area shall include a minimum of one tree for every two hundred fifty square feet.

b.    Medium and High Density Residential Buffer Area. When a medium or high density residential structure is located adjacent to a single-use commercial or industrial structure/use and an aspect of the commercial or industrial use has a negative visual impact (i.e., outdoor storage, loading bays, etc.) on the residential structure, the planning commission shall require the developer to create a screening plan for their approval that mitigates the visual impact(s) in question.

c.    Fully Sight-Obscuring Fence. The planning commission may require complete visual separation from residential uses if it determines that complete screening is necessary to protect abutting uses, and the required landscaped buffer is not practical. Such fence must be a minimum of six feet high (up to eight feet if warranted and approved by the planning commission) and completely sight-obscuring. Fences may be of wood, metal, bricks, masonry or other permanent materials.

8.    Plant Materials. Areas requiring landscaping shall be planted with substantial live plant material including: plants, shrubs, trees, sod, etc., for the purpose of buffering, screening, and improving the visual quality of the site.

a.    Types of Vegetation. At least twenty-five percent of trees and shrubs must be evergreen. Up to twenty-five percent of the landscape area can include specialty paving, street furniture, and outdoor seating areas. Trees that are planted in the park strip shall meet the specifications described in the street tree selection guide of Midvale City.

b.    Minimum Number of Trees. A minimum of one tree for every four hundred square feet of landscaping is required for all landscaped areas for which street tree requirements do not apply.

c.    Size of Trees. The following standards apply to the use of plant and tree material:

i.    Deciduous Trees. All deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper size of two inches.

ii.    Ornamental Trees. All ornamental trees shall have a minimum caliper size of one and one-half inches.

iii.    Evergreen Trees. All evergreen trees shall have a minimum height of six feet.

17-7-9.12.2.9 Trails and open space.

A.    Provide a continuous trail system throughout the Junction at Midvale project, connecting it to the Junction at Midvale open space and trail system, adjacent projects, regional trails and bikeways serving the site such as the Jordan River. Sidewalks may be considered as trail linkages if pedestrians and bicyclists are separated and the dual-use sidewalk has at least a clear width of eight feet.

B.    Public access shall be provided to all open space, directly from the public street/sidewalk system or through off-street pedestrian and/or bicycle paths. Trailheads, including seating, trash receptacles, and associated parking, shall be provided as appropriate and necessary. (Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)


17-7-9.12.2.10 Streets and alleys.

A.    All local streets, whether public or private, shall provide a detached sidewalk at least five feet wide, a planting strip between the sidewalk and the back of curb at least eight feet wide and street trees. The tree requirement shall be calculated at one tree per forty feet of frontage, either grouped or spaced at reasonable intervals, where allowed by the institutional controls.

B.    The number and width of curb cuts shall be minimized on residential and commercial streets so as to reduce the number of conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. Driveways to individual residential garages shall not be wider than sixteen feet at property line, and should not be closer than twenty-five feet apart. Driveways providing access to single family attached units shall be separated by a minimum landscaped area of five feet in width.

C.    Where a local or collector street is bordered by ground floor commercial uses with shop fronts oriented to the street, the planting strip may be replaced by at least a five-foot-wide hard surface amenity zone with street trees in grates or cut-outs where allowed by the institutional controls. Other street furniture such as wastebaskets, bicycle racks, pedestrian lights, and newspaper boxes may be located within this amenity zone. The sidewalk should be wide enough to provide at least five feet of width for a walking zone and at least a five-foot-wide zone next to the shop fronts for window shopping, sidewalk cafes, and the temporary display of goods.

D.    Local and collector streets shall be designed to accommodate the minimum widths for travel lanes and on-street parking lanes. 

E.    Parallel on-street parking should be encouraged on all local and collector streets, both public and private. Diagonal and head-in parking off of local or collector streets shall be used only in commercial or mixed-use areas, not in residential areas. Internal drive and access ways for multi-family residential projects are exempt from this requirement.

F.    Surface parking areas shall be screened by low perimeter landscaping, walls or railings to minimize the impact of vehicles and headlights onto adjoining residential structures and streets. 

G.    Pedestrians shall be buffered from the travel lane next to the curb by at least an eight-foot planting strip with street trees no more than forty feet on center apart where allowed by the institutional controls, or by at least a five-foot amenity zone between back of curb and walking zone with street trees in grates or planted cut-outs. Where feasible, on-street parallel parking is also encouraged to provide additional buffering to the pedestrian environment, and pedestrian activity on the street. (Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)


17-7-9.12.2.11 Parking standards.

In addition to those standards found in Section 17-7-9.6 of the Bingham Junction zone, the following standards shall apply to the creation of surface and/or structured parking lots and areas:

A.    Front Setbacks. No parking shall occur within the front setback of any building.

1.    Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to the prohibition of parking within a front setback.

a.    When a single family attached or detached structure is located on a local street and is set back at least eighteen feet from the property line, a private driveway may be used for off-street parking.

b.    When one owner or lessee occupies more than one hundred twenty thousand square feet of interior tenant space on one contiguous parcel or site, exclusive parking for handicapped, visitor and/or visiting executives may be provided for between the right-of-way and the front building elevation so long as they are signed accordingly. The maximum number of visitor and/or visiting executive parking stalls allowed in this area will be calculated by multiplying the square footage of the building by 0.0166 percent. Handicap stalls required in this area to meet building code are allowed in addition to this number, and will not count against the number calculated above. In allowing parking within the front setback, the following must be provided to minimize the visual impact of the parking from the public way and continue to focus on the pedestrian nature of the area between the public way and the front entrance of the building:

i.    The parking area shall be constructed using specialty paving (stamped and/or dyed concrete or pavers, etc.) and be designed to provide a visual link between the pedestrian way and the building entrance, identifying the area as primarily pedestrian in nature;

ii.    Public plazas or building entry features shall be visually and physically extended into the parking area to provide for further enhancement of the pedestrian experience;

iii.    The depth of the parking area shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible;

iv.    The parking area cannot encroach into any portion of required public open space.

B.    On-Street Parking. Parallel parking spaces on designated public and private streets may be used to meet the guest parking needs of residential and commercial uses. The city engineer will designate streets available for parking based on the width of the traveled surface, traffic demand, best engineering practices and adopted fire codes.

C.     Parking Garages and Structures. Parking garages and structures shall meet the following standards:

1.    Unless otherwise stated, all parking areas shall meet the requirements found in Section 17-7-9.6.

2.    Parking structures shall include pedestrian walkways and connections to the sidewalk system. These shall be clearly marked and continuous in design.

a.    Parking structures shall contain ground level retail, office or display windows along all street-fronting facades of the parking structure. Parking structures with street frontage in primarily residential areas may utilize residential units or residential architecture that reflects surrounding residential units to mask the visual impact of the parking structure.

b.    Parking structures that are not located adjacent to or within clear sight of a public street or other major transportation thoroughfare shall utilize plant material as screening to minimize the visual impact of the parking structure.

c.    Parking structures shall be designed with an architectural theme similar to the adjoining structures. Openings that face and can be seen from major vehicular and pedestrian thoroughfares shall be of similar size and, whenever possible, shape to those found on adjacent buildings.

d.    Walls, materials, patterns, colors, roof forms, and front entryways shall conform to the standards for all buildings in the applicable project area and shall reflect those used for adjacent buildings.

e.    Parking stall width may be reduced to eight feet, three inches.

f.    Parking stalls located adjacent to walls or columns shall be one foot wider than the minimum required width to accommodate door opening clearance and vehicle maneuverability.

3.    The Junction at Midvale zoning ordinance is intended, among others, to encourage the use of parking structures and discourage the use of surface parking. Therefore, the planning commission may waive one or all of the foregoing requirements if a competent architect can demonstrate that the requirement in question is not feasible and when the architect has utilized other architectural methods to blend the structure with neighboring structures and screen the visual impacts of the structure. 

D.    Medium and High Density Residential Use Parking Standards. Parking for new medium and high density residential uses shall comply with the following:

1.    Surfacing. Parking areas and driveways must be hard-surfaced with asphalt, concrete or a comparable material approved by the city engineer; maintained in good condition; and clear of obstructions at all times.

2.    Parking Requirements. The required number of off-street parking spaces available within a medium or high density residential project is dependent on the proximity of the project to a major transit facility. The parking requirements are as follows:

a.    Units located within one-eighth of a mile of the transit stop must have one and one-quarter parking spaces per two bedroom unit;

b.    Units located within a quarter of a mile of the transit stop must have one and one-half parking spaces per two bedroom unit;

c.    Units located outside of the quarter mile line will have parking as determined by the planning commission;

d.    One bedroom units shall be allowed a one-quarter parking space per unit reduction in the parking requirement;

e.    Units with three or more bedrooms shall include an additional one-quarter parking spaces per unit;

f.    One additional guest parking space for every four units shall be included on the parking plan although on-street parking, where allowed by the city engineer, may be used to meet this requirement;

g.    Projects that lack direct and unimpeded pedestrian access to the transit stop or that lack a viable and sustainable parking control plan shall include parking as required by the planning commission regardless of location;

h.    Mixed use projects shall include the parking spaces required for the commercial portion of the project at the dimensions required for commercial parking lots. These parking places may be shared with a residential use as allowed under this title, but they shall be concentrated near the commercial use to ensure access to the commercial use patrons.

3.    Parking Space Dimensions. All new medium and high density residential development shall provide parking spaces of the following minimum dimensions. The city engineer may approve minor (equal to or less than ten percent) variations in parking space dimensions.

a.    Up to sixty percent of the total parking spaces must be at least eight and one-half feet wide by eighteen feet long, however, the remaining parking spaces must be at least nine feet wide by eighteen feet long;

b.    ADA parking space width requirements vary and shall be consistent with current building code standards; and

c.    Compact spaces and motorcycle spaces may be included in a project but will not count toward the parking requirement.

4.    Grading and Drainage. Parking shall be graded and constructed as follows:

a.    Parking areas must be graded for proper drainage with surface water diverted to keep the parking area free of accumulated water and ice;

b.    Adequate control curbs must be installed to control drainage and direct vehicle movement;

c.    Parking area drainage must be detained on site, treated (if required by NPDES), and channeled to a storm drain or gutter as approved by the city engineer;

d.    Driveways may not exceed a ten percent slope;

e.    Drives serving more than one dwelling shall provide a minimum twenty-foot transition area at no greater than a two percent slope beginning at the back of the curb, or as otherwise approved by the city engineer, in anticipation of future street improvements; and

f.    The maximum stormwater discharge level accepted by the city is two-tenths of a cubic foot per second per acre.

5.    Street Access and Circulation. New medium and high density development shall provide the following:

a.    Off-Street Parking. Off-street parking areas must have unobstructed access to a street or alley. The parking area design for five or more vehicles must not encourage cars to back onto adjoining public sidewalks, parking strips, or roadways. With the exception of permitted tandem parking, parking spaces shall be independently accessible and unobstructed.

b.    Corners. No landscape obstruction is allowed in excess of two feet in height above street grade within the sight distance triangle. A reasonable number of trees with lower branches pruned to six feet to permit automobile drivers and pedestrians an unobstructed view of the intersection may be allowed by administrative permit.

c.    Driveway Access. For corners, the triangular area is defined by the intersection of the road right-of-way, the line extending from the point of curve at the top back of curb, and a line connecting them at points twenty-five feet from their intersection.

d.    Aisle. A minimum aisle width of twenty-four feet is required.

e.    Common Driveways. To encourage the location of parking in the rear yard and/or below grade, the city allows common driveways along shared side yards to provide access to parking if the owner restricts the deeds to both properties to preserve the shared drive in perpetuity. (Ord. 2014-09 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 8/25/2009O-13 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2009; Ord. 2/17/2009O-5 § 1 (part), 2009; Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)


17-7-9.12.2.12 Live/work units.

Live/work units are residential townhouse dwellings designed so that the first floor may be used either as living space or as commercial/retail space, as the owner chooses. Live/work units are regulated as follows:

A.    A live/work unit may be located only in mixed-use areas or on the fringes of residential areas within two hundred fifty feet of an entrance to the development from an arterial or collector street;

B.    Live/work units shall not exceed twenty percent of the units in an MPD and shall be designated as live/work units on the final plat;

C.    Vehicular access to live/work units/areas must be planned in a way that mitigates the impacts from additional commercial traffic to neighboring residential-only units;

D.    In addition to the parking spaces required by the residential needs, live/work units must have an additional two parking spaces adjacent to and dedicated for the commercial portion of the occupancy. Parking may be shared when five or more live/work units are adjacent to each other but no less than one and one-half parking spaces per unit must be provided. Parking may also be shared with primarily retail/office/flex uses at the discretion of the planning commission;

E.    Commercial uses shall be limited to the ground floor of the live/work unit;

F.    Live/work units shall not include outdoor storage, outdoor display of merchandise, nor parking/storage of any vehicle in excess of twelve thousand pounds gross vehicle weight;

G.    Live/work units shall not include identifying signage in excess of a four-square-foot name plate attached to the dwelling;

H.    Live/work units are limited to the on-site employment of immediate family who occupy the dwelling and up to one employee that does not occupy the dwelling (this criteria is not intended to limit the number of employees who are engaged in business but conduct all work activities off-premises);

I.    Live/work dwellings shall be designed to reflect their status as primarily residential units;

J.    Live/work units shall not cause a demand for municipal services in excess of that associated with normal residential use;

K.    Live/work units shall be enclosed within a structure in complete conformity with current building, fire, electrical and plumbing codes; and

L.    Live/work units are limited to professional office, nonindustrial artistic, architectural/engineering office, real estate office, mail/Internet supply offices and other similar uses. Retail uses are prohibited except that architectural, artistic, engineering, drafting, and similar on-premises products may be displayed and sold by appointment only. Other prohibited uses include animal-related uses, auto-related uses, medical offices, sexually oriented businesses, and any use prohibited in the applicable zoning district. (Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)


17-7-9.12.2.13 Thematic elements.

A.    Thematic Elements Required. Each development must contain elements that tie the development together with an overall theme or themes. Developers shall utilize public spaces, open spaces, the relationships between buildings, scale and architecture of the buildings, public art and statuary, trail systems, plazas, pedestrian crossings, lighting or lighting fixtures, benches, trash receptacles, bicycle storage, other site furnishings, way-finding markers and other community signage, landscaping, trees and other plantings to create a sense of place that unifies the site by creating a distinct identity. The theme should, to the greatest extent possible, be compatible with the look and feel of other developments created under this chapter. Locations for mail delivery, bus stops and other informal gathering places should receive special attention when providing elements that unify the development.

B.    Planning Commission Evaluation. The planning commission shall evaluate the thematic ties within a development plan during the large-scale master planned development phase of the approval process. The planning commission may withhold approval of the large-scale master plan approval if they feel that the unifying elements within the development are inadequate to meet the intent of this chapter until an acceptable theme can be approved. Developments that have already been granted large-scale master plan approval by the planning commission as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be evaluated for compliance with this section by the department of community and economic development staff.

C.    Final Site Plan Approval. The developer shall include these elements in the landscaping plans, development layout and other plans included in the site plan packages for small-scale master plan approval. The planning staff shall evaluate each final site plan for compliance with the unifying elements as approved by the planning commission. (Ord. 8/7/2007O-10 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2007)

17-7-9.12.3.1 Purpose.

A.    The approximate 9.6-acre property located at the northwest corner of 7800 South and Holden Street, although part of the Bingham Junction zone district, was not part of the overall large scale master plans which were adopted for the remainder of the Bingham Junction area. Because of this, specific uses, densities, open space and development standards were never established for this property. The purpose of the silver refinery overlay is to create the appropriate uses, densities and standards for this property, taking into account the specific circumstances and constraints attached to it. These circumstances and constraints include:

1.    Having viable commercial frontage on the corner of the Holden Street and 7800 South intersection with existing commercial development on other corners.

2.    The majority of the property having no visibility from Holden Street and limited access because it is located behind existing commercial and industrial development.

3.    The north and west boundaries being located immediately adjacent to existing single-family attached residential development.

4.    The property containing a historical cemetery that has significance to the community and descendants of those buried there.

5.    The property being isolated and unable to directly derive from the benefits of the adjacent, larger master planned area’s open space, clustered densities and uses.

B.    The intent of the silver refinery overlay chapter is to encourage the creation of:

1.    A high quality development that encourages single-family detached units and includes a mix of residential, preferably a product type that adds something new to the area and commercial uses.

2.    Public open space that preserves the historic cemetery and provides for its appropriate use as a public amenity.

3.    Private open spaces that preserve community valued characteristics of the property and create a sense of place and identity, provide usable areas for the residents, and provide appropriate setbacks and buffers to enhance urban design, streetscape, and visual quality for the area, while respecting the surrounding existing development.

4.    A development that revitalizes this portion of a former Superfund Site and addresses the environmental conditions of the site through the adherence to the applicable institutional controls governing this area. (Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-9.12.3.2 Boundary.

A parcel of land situated in the E1/2 SE1/4 of Section 26, Township 2 South, Range 1 West, Salt Lake Base & Meridian, county of Salt Lake, state of Utah, described as follows:

(Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-9.12.3.3 Large scale master plan requirement.

The property is required to be master planned as a whole under the large scale master plan provision prior to any specific development applications, i.e., small scale master plans, subdivision plats, conditional use permits, site plans, being accepted by the city for review and approval. Each development application must be consistent with the large scale master plan. The large scale master plan must include the following elements:

A.    At a minimum, the plan shall show the general layout of future development including general uses, public open space, roads, circulation, and main vehicular and pedestrian accesses.

B.    A dedication of at least nine percent of the real property to be improved, at no cost to the city, as accessible and useable public open space. It is expected that the historical cemetery be made a part of this public open space area. The dedication is based on the clustering and increased densities allowed within the overlay.

C.    The maximum residential density shall be 19.3 units per acre for all residential areas combined.

D.    Vehicular accesses shall comply with the city’s typical access management standards.

E.    For vertical mixed-use development, the maximum FAR is 3.0.

F.    In conjunction with the large scale master plan, a development agreement, in a form satisfactory to the city attorney and city council, shall be recorded with the property wherein the property owner, and its successors and assigns, agree to comply with the provisions of the conditional use permit for the master planned development. This agreement shall also provide security, to the satisfaction of the city attorney and city council, for all on- and off-site public improvements associated with the development.

G.    The large scale master plan, and all subsequent development applications, will demonstrate that it is in conformance with applicable institutional controls.

H.    Subdivisions, small scale master plans, site and project plans, conditional use permits and building permits within the silver refinery overlay shall be in accordance with the current building code, this chapter, and Chapter 17-7-3 and Title 16 of the Midvale City Code. (Ord. 2015-06 § 1 (Att. A): Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))

2.    Rear. The rear yard setback shall be of sufficient depth to allow proper parking and landscaped areas to the rear of the buildings. Unless otherwise approved as a conditional use by the planning commission, rear yards and the rear of buildings shall not abut a public street.

3.    Side. There is no side yard setback for commercial and mixed-use development except as required by the International Building Code and required landscape buffers.

C.    Height. The maximum height for the zone is five stories. If a structure is constructed within fifty feet of a single-family residential structure, the maximum height shall not be constructed in excess of one story higher than the nearest adjacent residential building.

D.    Building Orientation and Scale. Commercial and mixed-use structures shall be oriented and scaled as follows:

1.    Structures shall be serviced by a local street, an access road or drive, or an alley and shall not gain access from a collector or arterial street except as approved by the city engineer. Structures that front a courtyard, paseo, or common open space/recreation area are encouraged.

2.    Buildings shall be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and of buildings and to minimize road area.

3.    Ground floor pedestrian entrances must be oriented toward adjacent streets, plazas, courtyards, sidewalks and trails.

4.    Buildings shall be designed to minimize pedestrian and automobile conflict while providing pedestrians direct access to a sidewalk or trail.

5.    Building planes shall incorporate varying heights, textures, shapes or colors to mitigate the visual impact buildings have on the public realm.

6.    Building design and orientation should consider exposure to sunlight to avoid energy inefficiencies.

7.    Gathering areas in central areas and between buildings shall be encouraged. These areas shall be designed, through landscaping, hardscape, outdoor furniture, and public art, among others, to create a conducive atmosphere for people to come together.

E.    City-Wide Utility Infrastructure. Each project and each structure within each project shall include infrastructure that facilitates connection to Questar Gas, Rocky Mountain Power, Comcast Cable, UTOPIA, and CenturyLink. This requirement may be waived if any of the aforementioned utilities decline, in writing, the opportunity to install or utilize the necessary infrastructure. The director of community and economic development and authorized designee may approve the waiver. (Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-9.12.3.9 Commercial and mixed-use architectural standards.

All new development must present an attractive, coordinated streetscape, incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. All new development in the commercial land use areas shall comply with the following architectural standards:

A.    Walls. No more than three materials shall be used for primary wall surfaces.

1.    Materials. Exterior finishes shall be of traditional, time- and weather-tested techniques and shall include a substantial use of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, prairie stone, and/or wood or synthetic wood products. Glazing may be used as a primary exterior material when glazing is proposed as a major architectural design element or look for a project area consisting of at least two buildings and including all of the buildings that are separated by a major feature such as a linear park, collector street, or similar element that sets an area apart. Retaining and screening walls shall be of materials complementary to the building’s materials.

2.    Stucco. The use of stucco, synthetic stucco and EIFS should be limited and shall not exceed fifty percent of any elevation. The planning commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the architectural detail and excellence of a structure is such that the use of stucco in excess of this standard is warranted.

3.    Other Architectural Materials/Finishes. Architectural pre-cast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, and architectural metals should be used primarily to provide architectural detail and relief. Fiberglass and/or metal panels may be used in relatively small quantities. The planning commission may allow other materials and material quantities that it finds add to the architectural excellence of the structure and project.

4.    Prohibited Materials. Vinyl and aluminum siding products are prohibited as wall materials.

5.    Base Materials. Each structure shall have a base or foundation material of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone. This base or foundation shall be a minimum height of one-third the overall height of the structure. The base or foundation shall extend beyond the plane of the wall above it, creating a larger mass at the base of the building. The planning commission may allow for minor deviations to allow this base to terminate at visual breaks in the architecture or when the one-third base height overshadows the rest of the building architecture, specifically in single-story structures. The planning commission may approve alternative materials that are the qualitative equivalent of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, provided the alternative material conveys a sense of quality and detail that lends itself to the overall building design, ages gracefully and requires little maintenance.

6.    Brick and Rock Pattern. Ledge stone, uncoursed ledge rock, random or coursed Ashlar Flemish bond, English bond, common bond, running bond or drystack patterns shall be used for finished brick, rock and stone work. Herringbone, basket weave, vertical stack, stack bond, uncoursed roughly squared, and other vertical, irregular, or diagonal masonry patterns or vertical, non-alternating bond courses may be used only as an accent. Other masonry patterns shall not be used on vertical surfaces except as expressly authorized by the planning commission.

7.    Color Scheme. Buildings shall use a cohesive palette of colors which complement nearby buildings. Without limiting the use of color, large areas of walls shall be subdued in color and not reflective. Intense colors should be used as accent only.

8.    Design Consistency. All exposed sides of a building shall be designed with the same level of care, quality and integrity. Buildings should be attractive and visually engaging from all exposed sides.

B.    Roofs. Roof lines and shapes shall be consistent with the design and structure of the building, and should be consistent with the roof lines of adjacent buildings. Roof forms should reflect the facade articulation and building massing, as opposed to a single-mass roof over an articulated facade.

1.    Pitched roofs. Where pitched roofs are used the following standards shall apply:

a.    All the roofs and secondary roofs of a building shall be constructed of the same material. All metal roofs must be of a subdued color. Painted roof shingles are prohibited.

b.    Slopes of roofs shall be of equal pitch if a gable or hip roof is employed. Roof forms shall be designed in ways and/or used in combinations to break up large, continuous building forms, particularly for structures that are wider than they are tall. Long unbroken ridgelines are prohibited.

2.    Parapets. Parapets shall be provided to articulate flat roofs and hide roof-mounted equipment. The following standards shall apply:

a.    Parapets shall have strong cornice detailing to provide interest and scale.

b.    Long unbroken parapets, particularly for buildings that are wider than they are tall, are prohibited.

3.    Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be hidden from view from the adjoining street with either a parapet or a penthouse. Penthouses shall utilize materials, colors and form similar to that of the building.

C.    Fences, Hedges, and Walls. Fences, hedges and walls should be used on a limited basis, and only where determined necessary to screen or buffer the incompatible or unsightly elements of a project such as loading areas and trash pick-up areas, among others, or as required for specific athletic facilities. The following standards apply to new development of fences, hedges and walls:

1.    Required Setbacks. A fence, hedge, wall, column, pier, post, or any similar structure or any combination of such structures is permitted in the required setback of a zone district if it meets the following conditions:

a.    All fences and walls meet the requirements of Title 15 of this code, Buildings and Construction;

b.    No fence, hedge, or wall extends beyond or across a property line without a recorded agreement with the abutting property owner;

c.    Reserved;

d.    Only one fence or wall shall be allowed per property line. Double fences, walls or combination thereof are prohibited; and

e.    No barbed wire or other sharp, pointed, or electrically charged fence may be erected or maintained, except a temporary fence on a construction site to protect the property during the period of construction may be topped with barbed wire where the barbed wire is not less than eight feet above the ground and does not extend more than two feet above the temporary fence.

2.    Height. No fence structures may exceed seven feet in height except as needed for screening purposes in accordance with subsection (I) of this section. Fence height shall be measured as follows:

a.    In a required yard abutting a street, the total effective height above the finished grade measured on the side nearest the street;

b.    In any other required yard, the total effective height above the finished grade measured on the side nearest the abutting property;

c.    On a property line, measured from the finished grade of either side when the abutting property owners are in agreement; and

d.    A temporary fence on a construction site may be as high as required to protect the property during the period of construction.

3.    Athletic Facilities. Fencing around athletic facilities, including, without limitation, tennis courts, may be fourteen feet in height so long as all portions above six feet are constructed with at least fifty percent non-opaque materials.

4.    Conformance with This Section. No person shall construct, alter, or maintain a fence, hedge, wall, column, pier, post, or any similar structure or any combination of such structures except in conformance with all of the requirements of this section.

D.    Reserved.

E.    Miscellaneous. Security devices shall have materials and colors that complement the building’s architecture and building materials. Accessory structures shall be architecturally compatible with the primary development. Satellite dishes shall not be placed in view from the front yards.

F.    Exterior Structure. All exterior walls of all structures shall be constructed in compliance with the following:

1.    Finishes. All buildings shall use one or more of the following durable materials as significant finish: architectural pre-cast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, brick cladding, natural and cast stone, prairie stone, architectural metals, and glazing. Architectural site-cast concrete may be allowed if designed, articulated, and colored for a finished appearance on all buildings. At least fifty percent of all buildings visible from a major thoroughfare shall be composed of brick, stone, architecturally treated CMU, architectural pre-cast concrete and/or glazing.

2.    Quality. High standards for exterior materials, exterior building systems, and their application are expected. In particular, the design and application of EIFS or synthetic stucco is expected to be of a high enough quality to allow for crisp detailing and substantial relief. The wall area from finished grade to where the use of EIFS begins shall be clad by a hard, durable material such as brick, stone, architectural pre-cast concrete, or architecturally treated concrete masonry units.

3.    Form Variations. Buildings shall provide variation in the form of facades that adjoin streets. Street-facing facades shall make use of at least two of the following variations. Secondary facades shall make use of at least one of the following variations. Variations should result from significant dimensional changes in plane, color or detail as accomplished by such devices as:

k.    A distinguished upper floor for buildings with at least four floors; or

l.    Any other treatment the planning commission may approve that meets the intent of this section. Primary public entry(s) shall be architecturally emphasized so that pedestrians can easily find them.

6.    Storefronts. Awnings, canopies, arcades or other architectural features should be used to reduce glare on storefront glass and to shelter the pedestrians standing near the storefront. Cantilever awnings and canopies from the building face so as to keep sidewalks as clear and unobstructed as possible. The planning commission may permit limited use of supporting columns as part of a thematic design or corporate standard so long as the columns do not hinder pedestrian traffic or access.

7.    Drive-Through Windows. Drive-through windows shall be located at the side or rear of buildings. While not desirable, a drive aisle may be located between the building and the street so long as its width is minimized, any pedestrian crossings of it are clearly delineated with special paving treatments, no parking spaces occur off of it and a low wall, railing with landscaping, or continuous hedge at least three feet high between stacked cars and the sidewalk.

8.    Opaque (solid) storefront security closures (rolling doors, etc.) are not allowed.

9.    Weather Protection. Weather protection features such as awnings, canopies, doors inset by at least three feet, or arcades shall be provided at all customer entrances.

11.    Secondary Facades. Building facades that face the street but do not have pedestrian entries shall be composed of high quality materials such as brick or stone, and shall provide variety and interest in the facade through the introduction of such elements as pilasters, recessed or protruding bays, changes in materials and/or colors, building lighting elements, display windows with products or product graphics, transparent windows or clerestories, and well-designed signs and graphics.

G.    Openings. The following standards apply to openings of all structures:

1.    Entry Doors. Entry doors must be covered by a roof and must be a primary element of the front of the structure.

2.    Windows. Bay windows shall have from three to five sides.

3.    Corner Buildings. Special attention shall be given to corner buildings that are highly visible, that may serve as landmarks and provide a sense of enclosure at intersections. Special attention can be achieved by architecture, landscape, and public place.

4.    Minimum Opening Area. Not less than twenty-five percent of any street-facing building facade shall be made up of window or door areas. Not less than fifteen percent of any other building face on a third or higher story shall be made up of windows, balconies or other opening areas unless an adjacent building within twenty feet of that side face obscures the majority of that side face from public view. The planning commission may allow for a reduction to the minimum opening requirement if the applicant can demonstrate the building floor plan(s) required by the use cannot effectively accommodate the requirement and other architectural elements are used to (a) create visually interesting facades, (b) avoid large areas of blank facades, and (c) provide a human scale and details. Uses that may qualify for this reduction may include warehouses and uses which lend themselves to a more residential character, i.e., residential care facilities and hotels/motels. This provision may also be applied to portions of buildings with three street frontages to accommodate kitchens, restrooms and other utility areas.

H.    Reserved.

I.    Screening. Trash collection and recycling areas, service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall be screened on all sides so that no portion of such areas are visible from major transportation thoroughfares and adjacent properties. Required screening may include new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof.

1.    For nonresidential and mixed-use structures, all roof-mounted mechanical and electrical equipment, communication antennas or dishes shall be screened from the view of a pedestrian at the far side of adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less, or designed and/or located as part of the overall architectural design.

2.    For residential structures, roof-top mechanical equipment, vents, flues, fans and other pieces of equipment shall be screened and/or organized to leave sloped roofs as simple and uncluttered as possible, or, where roofs are flat, to be screened from view of a pedestrian at the far side of the adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less. Where such appurtenances are visible, they shall be painted a color that matches the roof color or other architectural features so that their visual impact is minimized.

3.    Refuse containers shall be screened from view on all sides. Screen walls and fences shall be one foot higher than the object to be screened. An opaque gate shall be included where required to complete screening.

4.    Loading docks and/or service areas shall be located to the side or rear of buildings. Where they are directly visible from streets and nearby residential buildings, they shall be screened by walls at least eight feet high, or densely and continuously massed landscaping that maintains its screening capabilities in the winter. Raised planters, berms or other landforms may also be used in conjunction with landscaping or walls. A combination of dense, continuous landscaping and walls may allow the use of lower walls, but no lower than four feet high from finished grade. (Ord. 2019-06 § 1 (Att. B) (part); Ord. 2016-15 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-9.12.3.10 Commercial and mixed-use landscaping.

The following landscaping standards apply to all new development in the commercial land use areas:

A.    Required Landscaping. The applicant shall professionally landscape the lot, according to an approved landscape plan, as a condition precedent to receiving a certificate of occupancy for all commercial uses. The community development director shall evaluate landscape plans for all permitted uses. The planning commission shall evaluate landscape plans for conditional uses. Landscape plan approval is a condition precedent to issuance of a building permit for the parcel. All landscaping shall be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, unless seasonal conditions make installation unfeasible, in which case the applicant shall provide cash security or its approved alternative for all landscaping yet to be completed, which landscaping shall be installed by the following May 31st.

1.    Physical Connections. Each lot shall have a system of pedestrian walkways and sidewalks that provide connections between the building entrances, neighboring building entrances, sidewalks, parking areas, open space and public trails.

2.    Minimum Landscaped Area. Thirteen percent of the interior area of each commercial or mixed-use lot shall be developed as landscaped setbacks, courtyards, plazas, open space or walkways.

3.    Landscaped Setback from Edge of Public Right-of-Way. The minimum landscaped setback from the edge of 7800 South, Holden Street and other interior roads shall be thirty feet from the back of the curb. All setbacks that incorporate linear trails and amenities as part of an overall trails plan shall be provided with an easement for public use to be recorded against the property.

4.    Screening. Maintenance buildings, trash collection and recycling areas, storage and service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall not be permitted in the front setback of any building and shall be located behind the main building structure, or completely screened from public view.

5.    Building Foundation Landscaping. The ground adjacent to the building foundation must be landscaped if it is visible from public vantage points.

6.    Residential Buffer. A landscaped buffer shall be required to separate residential uses from commercial uses as follows:

a.    Single-Family Detached Landscaped Buffer Area. The landscape buffer area must be a minimum of thirty feet wide to provide adequate screening, buffering, and separation of these uses from single-family detached residential uses. The landscape treatment should use a combination of distance and low level screening to separate the uses to soften the visual impact of the commercial or industrial use. The thirty-foot buffer area may be shared between adjoining properties, upon adequate proof of reciprocal easements to preserve and maintain the buffer area. The landscaped buffer area shall include a minimum of one tree for every two hundred fifty square feet.

b.    Medium Density Residential Buffer Area. When a medium density residential structure is located adjacent to a single-use commercial structure/use and an aspect of the commercial use has a negative visual impact (i.e., outdoor storage, loading bays, etc.) on the residential structure, the planning commission shall require the developer to create a screening plan for their approval that mitigates the visual impact(s) in question.

c.    Fully Sight-Obscuring Fence. The planning commission may require complete visual separation from residential uses if it determines that complete screening is necessary to protect abutting uses, and the required landscaped buffer is not practical. In such instances, the planning commission shall determine the appropriate width and type of landscaping to be used in conjunction with a completely sight-obscuring fence of at least six feet high (up to eight feet if warranted and approved by the planning commission). Fences may be of wood, metal, bricks, masonry or other permanent materials.

7.    Plant Materials. Areas requiring landscaping shall be planted with substantial live plant material including: plants, shrubs, trees, sod, etc., for the purpose of buffering, screening, and improving the visual quality of the site.

a.    Types of Vegetation. At least twenty-five percent of trees and shrubs must be evergreen. Up to twenty-five percent of the landscape area can include specialty paving, street furniture, and outdoor seating areas. Trees that are planted in the park strip shall meet the specifications described in the street tree selection guide of Midvale City.

b.    Minimum Number of Trees. A minimum of one tree for every four hundred square feet of landscaping is required for all landscaped areas for which street tree requirements do not apply.

c.    Size of Trees. The following standards apply to the use of plant and tree material:

i.    Deciduous Trees. All deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper size of two inches.

ii.    Ornamental Trees. All ornamental trees shall have a minimum caliper size of one and one-half inches.

iii.    Evergreen Trees. All evergreen trees shall have a minimum height of six feet.

8.    See Section 17-7-9.5 for further landscaping standards. (Ord. 2016-15 § 1 (Att. A) (part); Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-9.12.3.11 Trails and open space.

A.    Provide a continuous trail system throughout the master planned project, connecting it to the open space, adjacent projects, regional trails and bikeways serving the site such as the Jordan River. Sidewalks may be considered as trail linkages. Trails through open space areas shall be a minimum of eight feet wide unless the planning commission determines the specific situation warrants a lesser width.

B.    Public access shall be provided to all open space, directly from the public street/sidewalk system or through off-street pedestrian and/or bicycle paths. Trailheads, including seating, trash receptacles, and associated parking, shall be provided as appropriate and necessary. (Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-9.12.3.12 Streets and alleys.

A.    All local streets, whether public or private, shall provide a sidewalk at least five feet wide. The tree requirement shall be calculated at one tree per forty feet of frontage, either grouped or spaced at reasonable intervals, where allowed by the institutional controls.

B.    The number and width of curb cuts shall be minimized on residential and commercial streets so as to reduce the number of conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. Driveways to individual residential garages shall not be wider than sixteen feet at property line. Driveways providing access to single-family attached units shall be separated by a minimum landscaped area of three feet in width.

C.    Where a local or collector street is bordered by ground floor commercial uses with shop fronts oriented to the street, the planting strip may be replaced by at least a five-foot-wide hard surface amenity zone with street trees in grates or cut-outs where allowed by the institutional controls. Other street furniture such as wastebaskets, bicycle racks, pedestrian lights, and newspaper boxes may be located within this amenity zone. The sidewalk should be wide enough to provide at least five feet of width for a walking zone and at least a five-foot-wide zone next to the shop fronts for window shopping, sidewalk cafes, and the temporary display of goods.

D.    Local and collector streets shall be designed to accommodate the minimum widths for travel lanes and on-street parking lanes.

E.    Surface parking areas shall be screened by low perimeter landscaping, walls or railings to minimize the impact of vehicles and headlights onto adjoining residential structures and streets. (Ord. 2013-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-9.12.3.13 Parking standards.

In addition to those standards found in Section 17-7-9.6 of the Bingham Junction zone, the following standards shall apply to the creation of surface and/or structured parking lots and areas:

A.    Front Setbacks. No parking shall occur within the front setback of any building.

1.    Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to the prohibition of parking within a front setback.

a.    When a single-family attached or detached structure is located on a local street and is set back at least eighteen feet from the property line, a private driveway may be used for off-street parking.

b.    When one owner or lessee occupies more than one hundred twenty thousand square feet of interior tenant space on one contiguous parcel or site, up to five percent of the total parking supplied, not to exceed twenty parking spaces, may be located between the right-of-way and the front elevation so long as they are signed and used exclusively as handicapped, visitor and/or visiting executive parking. The remaining area in front of the building must be designed and constructed as a primarily pedestrian space even if limited vehicular access is allowed.

B.    On-Street Parking. Parallel parking spaces on designated public and private streets may be used to meet the guest parking needs of residential and commercial uses. The city engineer will designate streets available for parking based on the width of the traveled surface, traffic demand, best engineering practices and adopted fire codes.

C.    Parking Garages and Structures. Parking garages and structures shall meet the following standards:

1.    Unless otherwise stated, all parking areas shall meet the requirements found in Section 17-7-9.6.

2.    Parking structures shall include pedestrian walkways and connections to the sidewalk system. These shall be clearly marked and continuous in design.

a.    Parking structures shall contain ground level retail, office or display windows along all street-fronting facades of the parking structure. Parking structures with street frontage in primarily residential areas may utilize residential units or residential architecture that reflects surrounding residential units to mask the visual impact of the parking structure.

	Single-Family, Attached and Detached	2 spaces per dwelling unit

4.    Guest Parking with Private Streets. In residential developments with private streets where on-street parking is unable to be accommodated because of limited street width, guest parking shall be provided at a rate of one space for every four units and shall not include any private driveways. Guest parking shall be located within an accessible and reasonable distance from all parts of the development. This may require more than one guest parking area to be constructed.

5.    Parking Space Dimensions. All new medium density residential development shall provide parking spaces of the following minimum dimensions. The city engineer may approve minor (equal to or less than ten percent) variations in parking space dimensions.

a.    Up to sixty percent of the total parking spaces must be at least eight and one-half feet wide by eighteen feet long, however, the remaining parking spaces must be at least nine feet wide by eighteen feet long;

b.    ADA parking space width requirements vary and shall be consistent with current building code standards; and

c.    Compact spaces and motorcycle spaces may be included in a project but will not count toward the parking requirement.

6.    Grading and Drainage. Parking shall be graded and constructed as follows:

Antennas, equipment, and the supporting structures shall be selected to achieve the architectural compatibility with the host structure to which they are attached. Roof-mounted antennas are an allowed use only on a flat roof and shall be screened, constructed and painted to match the structure to which they are attached. The planning commission shall review and may grant approval to place roof-mounted stealth antennas on a pitched roof if the antenna(s) are compatible with the existing structure. Roof-mounted antennas may be mounted on existing penthouses or mechanical equipment rooms if the antennas and antenna support structures are enclosed or visually screened from view.

a.    Stealth facilities shall be designed to substantially conceal and camouflage the antennas and associated equipment.

i.    Antennas shall be mounted at least five feet behind any parapet wall or from the exterior wall of the building. The maximum height of an antenna mounted between five and ten feet behind a parapet or exterior wall shall be directly proportional to the setback distance, and may not exceed a height of ten feet above the top of the parapet wall or roof line of the building.

ii.    The planning commission shall review and may grant approval for any new antenna(s) that require construction of a new screening wall. New screening wall(s) shall be in harmony with the structure’s mass, architectural features, and overall aesthetics. Architectural and structural renderings, three-dimensional representation, line-of-sight diagrams, photo simulations, and/or building elevations of the proposed modifications may be required to effectively demonstrate the requested changes meeting the intent of this chapter.

b.    Non-stealth facilities shall only be considered in locations in which adverse visual impacts are not a substantial concern due to the location of the facility and the nature of the surrounding land uses.

17-7-11.1 The Main Street neighborhood.

A.    The Main Street Neighborhood.

1.    The form-based code (FBC) for the Main Street district was developed in response to the city’s previous planning projects. The 2016 general plan (GP) identifies the neighborhood as one of the city’s “opportunity areas.” The Main Street small area plan (SAP) was adopted in 2018 to further define what those opportunities are, develop more specific goals, and provide strategic projects to achieve those goals. Creating and adopting an FBC for the Main Street area is one of those strategic projects.

2.    The FBC district is located in a unique place near the western edge of the city limits and between the recent Bingham Junction developments and the I-15 and railway corridor. It incorporates the historic Main Street and the surrounding light industrial and commercial properties. The FBC district boundary is shown in Figure 1.01.

Figure 1.01

Main Street Form-Based Code District Boundary
[IMAGE]


B.    Goals.

1.    The goals for the future of the Main Street neighborhood are presented in both the GP and SAP. These goals were developed over several years through various planning processes that included input from local residents, business and property owners, elected and professional members of the city government, and professional planning consultants.

2.    The many goals for the Main Street neighborhood can be combined into one objective: create a vibrant, walkable town center. The individual goals include improved connectivity to the surrounding areas and TRAX station, bikeway connections, human-scale walkable development, both to preserve the historic character of Main Street and promote new development, greater use diversity, support existing businesses and attract new investment, strengthen residential areas, and improve neighborhood identity.

3.    When implemented well, FBCs have been shown to produce more reliably predictable outcomes than traditional land use zoning. When preferred development goals are identified, an FBC can be customized to achieve the desired results. This FBC has been written and designed to meet the specific goals for the future of Midvale’s Main Street neighborhood.

C.    History and Existing Conditions.

1.    Midvale City, formerly known as Bingham Junction, was established at an important railroad crossing and became a center of mining industries. From 1871 to 1987, several different companies operated a number of smelters, refineries, and mills just west of Main Street. These operations processed copper, lead, zinc, arsenic, silver, and cadmium from ores that originated from mines in both the Bingham and Little Cottonwood canyons. The Main Street neighborhood sprang up directly adjacent to these extensive ore industries and became the thriving downtown of Midvale City.

2.    Since the height of the Midvale mining industry, the Main Street neighborhood has faced significant challenges. Main Street is no longer the commercial and social center of the city. It was incrementally isolated by the construction of I-15, freight and commuter railways, and the contaminated land left behind by the smelters.

3.    Recent changes have added new value and activity to the neighborhoods around Main Street. The large Bingham Junction commercial and residential development on the previously contaminated smelter land, the TRAX light rail commuter station, and new buildings in the area, including City Hall, have given the neighborhood momentum for improvement. Recent planning efforts are guiding this momentum to produce a thriving town center type of neighborhood. (Ord. 2020-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-11.2 Form districts.

A.    Form Districts.

1.    Form District Types.

a.    This FBC defines two distinct types of form districts:

i.    Main Street (MS);

ii.    Town center core (TCC).

b.    Subsections (A) through (C) of this section provide descriptions and example images for each form district.

2.    Form District Map.

a.    Figure 2.01 is the form district map. This map indicates the form district designation for all of the parcels within the FBC area. Form district designations are made based on the geographic location of each parcel and the relationships between adjacent form districts and streets.

Figure 2.01

Form District Map
[IMAGE]


i.    Most of the district boundaries between different form districts are drawn along existing parcel lines.

(A)    Changes to form district designation for parcels along a form district boundary may be considered for approval by the community development director only if parcels on both sides of the boundary are to be developed as part of the same lot.

(1)    Form district boundaries may deviate from parcel boundaries if the new form district boundary is clearly indicated and dimensioned on a site plan and is approved by the community development director.

(2)    It is important to maintain the Main Street (MS) form district designation along both sides of Main Street, as shown in Figure 2.01. Any changes to an MS district boundary shall not remove the MS district designation from the Main Street frontage of a lot. All building facades along Main Street shall meet the use, frontage, and building type requirements of the MS form district.

ii.    Form district boundaries that are not drawn along existing parcel lines have been drawn in anticipation of future changes in development patterns.

(A)    This type of form district boundary is subject to change as future redevelopment occurs. Changes shall fit new parcel lines, not significantly change the size of the form district, and are to be made by the community development director.

(B)    For parcels containing multiple form district designations, those designations within the parcel may be changed, subject to approval by the community development director as part of the preliminary application process.

(C)    Buildings may cross form district boundaries but are subject to the design requirements of each district in which each portion of the building is located.

3.    Form District and Correlated FBC Sections.

a.    The form district is one of the central organizing regulations within the FBC. Figure 2.02 shows the relationships between the major FBC regulations. These relationships take the form of permission and limitations for different combinations of the regulation parameters.

Figure 2.02

Correlations Between the Major FBC Regulations and Requirements
[IMAGE]


4.    Building Type and Use in Each Form District.

a.    Tables 2.01 and 2.02 describe the relationships between use, building type, and each form district. These tables compile information found in other sections of the FBC and are presented in this chapter as a quick reference between the permissions/limitations regarding use, building type, and the form district map. Section 17-7-11.3 governs allowed uses and provides additional detail on specific requirements.

B.    Main Street (MS) District.

1.    The unique character of Midvale’s Main Street distinguishes it from the other streets in both the neighborhood and the city. Because of these distinctions, the goals for the MS form district differ from the other districts. The primary purpose of the MS district is to preserve and promote the building forms, historic character, and experience of the traditional main street.

2.    The district boundary is drawn to include all land parcels that are adjacent to the Main Street right-of-way. This boundary allows the form of the entire street to be guided by the same form standards. This will build up a street that is continuously cohesive in its form, maintains the character of a traditional main street, and is legible as the city’s historic Main Street.

3.    The Main Street street type is unique to the MS district. This street type provides public space with the characteristics that are compatible with the existing and historic buildings and a pedestrian-oriented Main Street experience. Shared bike lanes along Main Street introduce additional connections and people.

4.    Uses permitted in the MS district are compatible with both the permitted building types and with an active town center that serves the needs of local residents. Residential uses will help activate the MS district.

5.    The primary frontage along Main Street ensures that buildings front directly on the street. This provides the spatial relationship between buildings and the street that supports the pedestrian nature and active use goals for the MS district.

	G+U = Ground and Upper Floors	N = Not Permitted

	G = Ground Floor Only	U = Upper Floors Only

C.    Town Center Core (TCC) District.

1.    The primary purpose of this district is to guide development and redevelopment that will provide the physical and spatial forms that support a walkable, vibrant, and attractive town center. This expands the town center style development from Main Street to the greater neighborhood.

2.    The TCC district is the largest district in the FBC area. The boundary is drawn to include properties along the major streets (Holden St./700 W., and Center St.) and parcels adjacent to those street-fronting properties. This guides future development and redevelopment that concentrates along these major streets and creates a town center neighborhood, rather than just a Main Street.

3.    The street hierarchy is evident within the TCC district, which includes all three types of streets. These street types are complemented with frontage types that create a hierarchy of smoothly transitioning street/building spatial relationships.

4.    Redevelopment in the TCC district provides an opportunity to build new streets that provide the much-needed connection across Holden Street. This increased connectivity supports multiple modes of transportation.

5.    The TCC district accommodates most diversity of uses and building forms. This allows for more modern types of development, larger buildings, a wider range of styles, and a use mix that supports a thriving town center.

17-7-11.4 Street types.

A.    General Requirements.

1.    Intent. The standards outlined in this section are intended to:

a.    Create complete streets that address all modes of travel, including pedestrian traffic, bicycle traffic, transit, and vehicular traffic;

b.    Address all features of the street right-of-way, including sidewalks, parkways, traffic lanes, bicycle lanes, and medians;

c.    Extend, where applicable, the existing logical and comprehensible system of streets and street names that result in a simple, consistent and understandable pattern of blocks, lots, and house numbers;

d.    Provide adequate access to all lots for vehicles and pedestrians;

e.    Create streets that are appropriate for their context in each of the form districts and are designed to encourage travel at appropriate volumes and speeds; and

f.    Create streets and public rights-of-way that aid in the safe and efficient management of stormwater runoff.

2.    Applicability. The standards in this section apply to all vehicular rights-of-way within the Main Street FBC area. The majority of implementation activities will occur when an existing street is rebuilt or a new street is built.

3.    General Requirements.

a.    All proposed streets, landscape or furnishings zones, and sidewalks shall be located in dedicated vehicular rights-of-way.

b.    All new vehicular rights-of-way shall match one of the street types as described in subsections (D) through (F) of this section, whether publicly dedicated or privately held.

c.    All streets shall be available for public use at all times, except when closed by the city. Gated streets and streets posted as private are not permitted except when closed by the city.

4.    Street Construction Specifications. All construction in the right-of-way shall follow specifications defined by the city. The street standards within this section are intended to be minimum requirements. The city may use alternative designs when reconstructing streets, provided the general intent of street construction specifications of the neighborhood is maintained.

B.    General Street Type Standards.

1.    Street Types.

a.    Street types defined in this section outline the acceptable street configurations for the FBC district.

b.    The street type map for the Main Street FBC district is shown in Figure 4.01. Solid lines indicate existing streets and dotted lines indicate potential new streets.

c.    Street type configurations are to be implemented when reconstructing existing streets or building new streets.

i.    The city may require changes to the right-of-way, pavement width, or additional street elements depending on unique site characteristics.

ii.    The city may permit modifications to street widths and required improvements. Any modifications shall be approved by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer, public works director, and fire marshal.

iii.    The potential new streets provide the critical connectivity and realign existing streets for increased connectivity and efficiency. These potential streets are not formally proposed but illustrate how future streets can meet the connectivity and access needs of future developments, regardless of when those developments occur.

d.    The hierarchy of street types, from the most major to the most minor street type is:

i.    Main Street;

ii.    Major commercial street;

iii.    Minor commercial street.

Figure 4.01

Street Type Map
[IMAGE]


2.    Graphics. The graphics in this chapter are samples of recommendations that illustrate a configuration of each street type. Exact cross-sections are subject to city review and approval. Examples in this chapter are drawn in detail for clarification purposes only. When applying the described standards to actual streets, other configurations are possible.

3.    Typical Street Elements. Typical elements of a right-of-way are divided into vehicular and pedestrian realms. Generally, the vehicular realm will be designed and controlled by the city. The pedestrian realm will be designed and improved by property owners, in coordination with the city.

a.    The vehicular realm is the space between the curbs on both sides of a street. It is comprised of travel lanes, parking lanes, turn lanes, transit stopping areas, bike lanes, and medians.

b.    The pedestrian realm is the space between the back of a street curb and the property line of the adjacent parcel. It is subdivided into two spaces, the park strip and the sidewalk. The sidewalk is the paved area along the edge of the right-of-way. Sidewalks are designed for the movement of pedestrian traffic along the street and pedestrian access to buildings. The park strip is the space between the sidewalk and the curb. It acts as a buffer area between the sidewalk and street. Park strips can be used in two different ways, described as two-use zones, the landscape zone and furnishings zone. These two-use zones are intermixed along each street based on the street type requirements.

i.    The landscape zone is where the park strip is unpaved and landscaped with ornamental plants, mulch, and/or street trees. It may also include swales, lighting, public art, and signage.

ii.    The furnishings zone is a paved portion of the park strip. It is designed for the pedestrian uses that would block the movement of pedestrian traffic in the sidewalk, such as sitting and gathering. Furnishings zones may include street trees in grates, street furniture, lighting, signage, bicycle parking, bollards, public art, and transit stops.

4.    Vehicular Travel Lanes. The number and width of vehicular travel lanes, parking lanes, and bike lanes are determined by the street type.

5.    Bicycle Lanes. The following types of bicycle accommodations are permitted in the vehicular zone per street type standards:

a.    “Dedicated bicycle lanes” are striped lanes on the outside of the outermost travel lane and are designated for bicycle use only. This lane typically occurs on both sides of the street and shall be five feet wide. The width of any adjacent gutters shall not be included in the bike lane width.

b.    “Marked shared lanes” are shared by both vehicular and bicycle traffic and are indicated by the shared arrow or “sharrow” symbol, a directional arrow painted on the pavement. Marked shared lanes are typically wider than a standard vehicular travel lane and should be a minimum of thirteen feet wide.

c.    “Unmarked shared lanes” refers to streets without any marked bicycle lanes that have traffic speeds and enough space for cyclists to safely ride along. Without designations, markings, or signage, these are essentially determined by each individual cyclist, are unregulated, and are not actual “lanes.”

6.    Transportation Facilities. Transportation facilities include those for public transit and delivery trucks.

a.    Public transit facilities should be included at each bus stop and TRAX station according to the following criteria:

i.    Public transit facilities are located in the furnishings zone of the park strip and may include loading areas, landings, ramps, transit shelters, benches, lighting, pedestrian clear zones, and all other reasonable accommodations.

ii.    All public transit facilities shall be coordinated with the UTA.

b.    Truck loading spaces (TLS) provide on-street short-term loading spaces for delivery trucks to prevent them from parking in travel lanes and pedestrian areas.

i.    Each TLS must be located in and fit within the width of an on-street parking lane. Street types without on-street parking lanes shall not have any TLSs.

ii.    TLS pavement markings should clearly define the size of the TLS and be adequate to accommodate the length of a typical delivery vehicle. This may require a longer space than the standard on-street parking space.

iii.    Signage at each TLS shall clearly post the maximum time that a delivery vehicle may occupy the space and the times of day and days of the week when the TLS is reserved for delivery vehicle loading activities. The sign should also indicate that regular on-street parking is allowed during non-loading times.

iv.    The number and location of each TLS should be determined by city staff and based on the demand for loading space adjacent to existing buildings and uses. The specific location of each TLS shall be indicated on the street and/or streetscape plans for each street.

7.    On-Street Parking. On-street parking requirements and permissions are determined by street type.

8.    Streetscape Landscaping.

a.    Streetscape designs shall be prepared for each street as part of a new or reconstructed street.

i.    Streetscape design plans shall be prepared by a landscape professional such as a landscape architect or certified landscape designer.

ii.    Whether a proposed development includes one or both sides of the street, streetscape plans must provide a consistent streetscape along the length of the street.

iii.    Streetscape plans shall meet the requirements in the pedestrian realm section of the applicable street type requirements table.

(A)    The streetscape plan shall define the size and spacing of the landscape and furnishings zones.

(B)    Planting plans shall be included for all landscape zones and planted medians.

b.    Street trees are required along all street fronts.

i.    Street trees shall be located in the park strip or bulb-out.

(A)    In furnishings zones, trees shall be located in tree wells, covered by tree grates, and planted in either structural soil or soil cells.

(B)    In landscape zones, trees shall be planted with the ground plane vegetation.

ii.    Street trees shall be regularly spaced at thirty feet on center and, where possible, coordinated with the location of light poles and utility poles in order to maintain consistent street tree spacing.

iii.    The community development director may approve a modification to street tree location if the thirty-foot requirement impedes building facade visibility.

9.    Stormwater Management. Incorporating stormwater management best practices is encouraged. Park strip features that help with stormwater management include drainage swales and slotted curbs in the landscape zones and permeable pavement in the furnishings zones. Stormwater management structures shall be approved by the city engineer.

10.    Fire Access.

a.    Street configurations have been calculated to provide emergency vehicle access. On streets where the total width of all travel lanes is narrower than twenty feet, the following shall apply:

i.    Passing areas shall be provided at one hundred twenty-foot intervals where a thirty-foot opening in the on-street parking or a thirty-foot dedicated pullout space is provided for vehicles to pull over to allow a fire truck to pass.

ii.    A driveway curb cut or fire hydrant zone may be utilized to fulfill the pull over requirement.

C.    General Street Layout Requirements.

1.    General Layout Standards. The following standards apply to new streets, reconstructed streets, or newly platted vehicular rights-of-way:

a.    Streets shall be designed to respect natural features, such as slopes, by following rather than being interrupted by or dead-ending at the feature.

b.    The street network shall form an interconnected pattern with multiple intersections.

c.    The arrangement of new or reconstructed streets shall provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new subdivisions.

2.    Intersections.

a.    Curb radii at intersections should be designed for the actual turning radius of the typical design vehicle, not the maximum design vehicle. The curb radius used at each intersection is determined by intersection type as shown in

Table 4.01. The following curb radii shall be used unless otherwise required/ authorized by the city:

i.    Small radii are required at intersection Type 1. See Table 4.01.

(A)    Intersections with on-street parking on both streets shall have a five-foot curb radius.

(B)    Intersections with on-street parking on one or neither of the streets shall have a fifteen-foot curb radius.

ii.    Medium radii are required at intersection Types 2 through 5. See Table 4.01.

(A)    Intersections with on-street parking on both streets shall have a ten-foot curb radius.

(B)    Intersections with on-street parking on one or neither of the streets shall have a twenty-five-foot curb radius.

iii.    Larger radii require special approval from the city and are limited to streets without on-street parking and intersections where a street must meet the design criteria for large vehicles.

b.    Marked crosswalks are required at all intersections and mid-block pedestrian crossings.

i.    Crosswalk marking type shall be determined by the community development director.

ii.    Crosswalk widths shall be a minimum of six feet.

iii.    Crosswalk markings shall be clearly located on the finished street surface and where required in parking and access areas. Crosswalks shall be marked with textured or colored pavement, thermoplastic applications, or another marking approved by the city.

iv.    Crosswalks with creative markings are allowed as a form of public art, with approval from the city.

v.    Crosswalk length shall encourage pedestrian activity. The required bulb-outs decrease unprotected crosswalk lengths which increases pedestrian safety and comfort.

vi.    Accessibility features such as ramps and warning panels, per the Americans with Disabilities Act or any more stringent state or local requirement, are required where all sidewalks terminate at a crosswalk or curb.

vii.    Ramps shall be oriented perpendicular to traffic, requiring two ramps per corner at intersecting streets.

c.    Bulb-outs shall be constructed at all intersections and mid-block crossings unless prohibited by the city.

i.    The depth of the bulb-out shall match the depth of the adjacent on-street parking lane (if any).

ii.    The radius of each bulb-out shall match the radius requirements for each intersection type. See Table 4.01.

iii.    Bulb-outs shall be planted with low-maintenance water-efficient live plants, which may include trees, that have a low mature height to provide unobstructed safety sight lines without requiring constant pruning.

3.    Street Lighting.

a.    Intent.

i.    To provide a safe and secure environment for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians;

ii.    To reduce glare from street and pedestrian lights on adjoining residences;

iii.    To contribute to the quality of each streetscape by integrating streetlight spacing and street tree spacing;

iv.    To respond to and further neighborhood character through the selection of light poles, bases, and fixtures appropriate to the commercial, residential or civic nature of surrounding uses; and

v.    To select consistent light poles, fixtures, lamp types, finishes and colors for all pedestrian and streetlights.

b.    Street Lighting Standards.

i.    Unless otherwise required by the city, all new streetlights shall comply with the following street lighting standards:

(A)    Light sources shall be at least as efficient as LED and no greater than 4,000K in correlated color temperature (CCT).

(B)    Light fixtures shall use a cut-off luminaire that is fully or partially shielded with no light distributed above the horizontal plane of the luminaire or into nearby residential structures.

(C)    Light fixtures shall use a cut-off luminaire that is fully or partially shielded with no light distributed above the horizontal plane of the luminaire or into nearby residential structures.

(D)    Streetlights shall be placed at intersections and at a frequency no less than one streetlight per every one hundred fifty feet of roadway, rounded up to the next whole number. Streetlight locations shall alternate sides of the street to the greatest extent possible.

(E)    Poles and fixtures shall be black, dark brown, or another neutral color approved by the city.

ii.    The community development director may exempt a street from these requirements if implementing a thematic design which incorporates lighting and fulfills the intent.

D.    Main Street.

1.    Intent.

a.    This special street type maintains the historic configuration of Main Street. This configuration includes the narrow right-of-way, lower traffic speed, wide pedestrian realm, on-street parking, and streetlights.

b.    This street type also includes elements that were not part of the original historic Main Street streetscape. Some of these elements are currently installed along portions of the street and include street trees, street furnishings, and ornamental plantings. These elements create a more pedestrian-oriented street and help set Main Street apart as a special street within the neighborhood and city.

2.    General Requirements.

a.    Main Street shall be newly constructed or reconstructed, in whole or in part, according to the standards in Table 4.02 and Figures 4.02 and 4.03. Measurements shown in these standards may need to be adjusted to actual dimensions on the ground. The installation of new streetscape elements shall emulate and provide continuity with the streetscape elements already installed on the southern blocks of Main Street.

3.    Applicability.

a.    This street type only applies to the section of Main Street from Center Street to 7th Avenue as indicated on the street type map, Figure 4.01. As Main Street is currently fully constructed, these requirements shall be implemented at any future street reconstruction.

F.    Minor Commercial Street.

1.    Intent.

a.    Minor commercial streets are the intermediate order street type that provide the interstitial connections between the higher order and lower order street types. They provide most of the neighborhood’s internal connections.

2.    General Requirements.

a.    Minor commercial streets shall be newly constructed or reconstructed, in whole or in part, according to the standards in Table 4.04 and Figures 4.06 and 4.07. Measurements shown in these standards may need to be adjusted to actual dimensions on the ground.

3.    Applicability.

a.    This street type applies only to the minor commercial streets as indicated in the street type map, Figure 4.01. These requirements shall be implemented with any future street redevelopment or reconstruction and, where incomplete sections exist, with the development projects on adjacent parcels.

b.    Existing minor commercial streets may have different right-of-way widths. This typical street section may need to be adjusted. Adjustments priorities are:

i.    Remove one parking lane (on either side) with extra space added to the buffer/sidewalk width.

ii.    Reduce buffer width. Buffers shall be a minimum width of three feet. Narrower buffer areas become part of the sidewalk width.

iii.    Reduce sidewalk width. Minimum sidewalk width is four feet.

17-7-11.5 Frontages.

A.    General Requirements.

1.    Intent.

a.    The frontage requirements outlined in this section define the interface between the public and private realms. This interface occurs at the line where each land parcel abuts a public right-of-way, referred to as the frontage, and is a continuous feature along both sides of each street. Building facades are a major component of this public/private interface, so building type is constrained by frontage type.

2.    Frontage Types.

a.    Three different frontage types are defined and applied to specific streets, as shown in the frontage map, Figure 5.01. Multiple types are used to create a town center neighborhood with a variety of street/frontage combinations. These combinations reinforce the street hierarchy based on each street’s connectivity, function, capacity, and its role in creating a walkable, vibrant town center.

b.    The three frontage types are: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary frontages are applied to the major roads, including Main Street and the major through roads. Secondary frontages are applied to the roads that directly connect to the major roads. Tertiary frontages are applied to the most minor streets.

c.    The hierarchy of frontage types, in order of priority, is:

i.    Primary frontage;

ii.    Secondary frontage;

iii.    Tertiary frontage.

d.    If multiple frontages exist on a single parcel, the frontage requirements shall be based on the highest priority frontage affecting the lot.

3.    Frontage Specifications.

a.    Minimum frontage coverage may be reduced to provide for a driveway access when no other frontage is available to be used for access. When frontage coverage is reduced using this provision, the provided driveway shall be limited to the minimum width required for access, as determined by city staff using the minimum width as a standard, and the remaining frontage shall be covered by a building or BTZ pedestrian space, as otherwise allowed within this title.

Figure 5.01

Frontage Map

Figure 5.02

Lot Configuration Types
[IMAGE]


B.    Primary Frontage.

1.    Intent.

a.    Primary frontages accommodate more intense development and maintain the town center type of spatial relationships between buildings and streets. Buildings are located very close to the right-of-way, creating a consistent street wall and prioritizing walkability.

b.    The values of the various parameters provide less flexibility than the other frontage types. Primary frontages are applied only to the Main Street and major commercial street types.

2.    Design Standards.

a.    Regulations for primary frontages are defined in Table 5.01 and Figures 5.03 and 5.04.

C.    Secondary Frontage.

1.    Intent.

a.    Secondary frontages accommodate medium intensity development. The purpose is to maintain town center style spatial relationships along streets and also to transition those relationships between the most intense and least intense development areas.

b.    The values of the frontage parameters provide more flexibility than the primary frontage, allowing for increased spatial diversity and development styles. Secondary frontages are applied primarily to the minor commercial street type.

2.    Design Standards.

a.    Regulations for secondary frontages are defined in Table 5.02 and Figures 5.03 and 5.04.

17-7-11.6 Building types.

A.    General Requirements.

1.    Buildings are one of the most prominent components of the built environment and collectively define much of the character of a streetscape or neighborhood. Buildings are collections of architectural elements that can be described in terms of both form and style. These building form requirements define the physical forms of the buildings without defining their style. These form requirements are designed to ensure that future building projects meet the goals of the Main Street town center.

2.    All building types must meet the following requirements:

a.    Form District. Each building type shall be built only in the form district(s) where they are explicitly allowed, as shown in the individual building type tables and summarized in Table 6.01.

Table 6.01

Building Type by Form District

	Building Type 	Form District

	MS 	TCC

	General 	P 	P

	Limited Bay 	N 	P

	Row 	P 	P

	Civic 	P 	P

b.    Use. Each building type can accommodate a variety of uses, as outlined in Section 17-7-11.3. Uses may be limited to a specific story of the building type. See individual building type tables in this section.

c.    Ground Floor Residential and Lodging Use Restrictions.

i.    Residential and lodging units are permitted on the ground floor; provided, however, that no such units shall be located within the occupied space required along the primary street-facing facade.

ii.    Notwithstanding any other requirement in this title:

(A)    Accessory residential and lodging uses, such as lobbies, meeting rooms, offices, etc., are permitted both within the required occupied space along the primary street-facing facade; and

(B)    Residential units may occupy the entirety of a row building in the town center core form district.

iii.    Grade Separation. Ground floor residential units shall be vertically separated by no more than four feet above or below the sidewalk level.

d.    Occupied Space Requirement. The occupied space requirement only applies to the required frontage area.

e.    No Other Building Types. All constructed buildings must meet the requirements of one of the building types permitted within the given form district.

f.    Permanent Structures. All buildings constructed shall be permanent construction without a chassis, hitch, wheels, or other features that make the structure mobile.

g.    Accessory structures are structures located on the same lot as the principal structure(s) with uses that are incidental to the use of the principal structure(s). Examples include a garage, parking structure, storage, utility, maintenance sheds, etc.

i.    Structures attached to the principal structure are considered part of the principal structure and are not accessory structures.

ii.    Detached accessory structures are permitted according to each building type (see individual building type tables in this section) and shall comply with all setbacks and the following:

(A)    Detached accessory structures are not permitted in the front yard or any other space between the principal structure and a right-of-way.

(B)    Detached accessory structures shall be located in the rear yard, behind the principal structure.

(C)    Detached accessory structures shall not exceed the height of the principal structure.

iii.    Accessory structures shall be built in a manner compatible with the principal building and shall use the same or similar quality materials as the principal building.

h.    Building Length. Maximum and minimum building lengths, as measured along the right-of-way property lines, are determined by frontage coverage and setback distances. See Section 17-7-11.5.

i.    Theme and Unity. The architectural design within a single development that includes multiple structures shall be organized around a consistent architectural theme in terms of the character, materials, texture, color, and scale of buildings. Restaurants, retail chains, and other franchise-style structures shall adjust their standard architectural theme to be consistent with the development’s overall architectural character.

j.    Active Streetscape. Variation in architecture is encouraged to create a more appealing streetscape. Variety can be achieved through porches, terraces, stoops, awnings, galleries, arcades, balconies, and canopies.

k.    Primary entrances for all building types shall be located along the primary street facade.

3.    Building Types. This FBC describes four building types:

a.    General;

b.    Limited bay;

c.    Row;

d.    Civic.

B.    General Building.

1.    Intent.

a.    The general building type accommodates a wide variety of uses. It is intended to be built close to the front and corner property lines allowing easy access to passing pedestrians and transit riders.

b.    Parking may be provided in the rear of the lot, internal to the building, or in an attached parking structure. Vehicular access should be located on the rear or side of the lot, only on the front if the rear or side is unavailable. On lots with more than one street frontage, vehicular access must be located on the side or rear street.

2.    Regulations.

a.    The general building is permitted in all form districts.

b.    Regulations for the general building type are defined in Table 6.02 and Figures 6.01a, 6.01b, and 6.01c.

b.    Applicability. All buildings shall meet the requirements of one of the roof types permitted by building type.

c.    Measuring Height. See Figure 6.09 for information on measuring roof height.

Figure 6.09

Height Measuring Diagram
[IMAGE]


d.    Other Roof Types. Other building caps not listed here as a specific roof type may be requested with the following requirements:

i.    The building is deemed as one having special significance to Midvale City or the overall Main Street neighborhood.

ii.    The shape of the roof type shall be significantly different from those defined in this section, i.e., dome, spire, vault.

e.    Solar Energy. Solar panels are permitted for all roof types.

f.    Appearance. Roofs shall provide an attractive appearance, considering that they may be viewed from above as a fifth facade. Equipment projections and access towers must be set back a minimum of ten feet from the edge of the roof.

2.    Parapet Roof. A parapet is a low wall projecting above a building’s roof along the perimeter of the building. It can be utilized with a flat or low-pitched roof and also serves to limit the view of roof-top mechanical systems from the street. See Figure 6.10.

a.    Parapet Height. Height is measured from the outermost roof membrane or structure to the top of the parapet.

i.    Minimum height is two feet and maximum height is six feet.

ii.    The parapet shall be high enough to screen the roof and any roof appurtenances visible from the street.

b.    Horizontal Expression Lines. An expression line shall define the parapet from the upper stories of the building and shall also define the top of the cap.

c.    Occupied Space. Outdoor (unenclosed) roof deck/terrace occupiable space is permitted in this roof type. Such occupiable spaces must meet fire code egress standards. The parapet wall may act as the perimeter barrier if it meets safety standards, otherwise an additional barrier is required.

d.    Rooftop Enclosures. Rooftop enclosures are permitted in this roof type. Occupiable space may not exceed ten percent or four hundred square feet of the roof footprint, whichever is larger. Enclosures must maintain the applicable roof setback.

Figure 6.10

Parapet Roof Example
[IMAGE]


3.    Pitched Roof. This roof type is sloped or pitched. Slope is measured with the vertical rise divided by the horizontal span or run. See Figure 6.11.

Figure 6.11

Pitched Roof Examples
[IMAGE]


a.    Pitch Measure. The roof may not be sloped less than 4:12 (rise/run) or more than 12:12.

b.    Configurations. Hipped, gabled, and combination of hips and gables with or without dormers are permitted.

c.    Parallel Ridge Line. A gabled end or perpendicular ridge line shall occur at least every one hundred feet of roof length when the ridge line runs parallel to the front lot line.

d.    Transparency. The upper floor transparency and blank wall limitation requirements apply to gable ends when the space within the roof is occupiable. Gable ends are exempt from these transparency requirements if there is no occupiable space within the roof.

e.    Roof height, measured from the ridge line down to the top story, is a function of pitch measure.

f.    Occupied Space. Occupiable attic space, the void within the roof trusses, may be incorporated within this roof type and not count as one story.

4.    Flat Roof. This roof type has a flat roof with or without overhanging eaves. See Figure 6.12.

Figure 6.12

Flat Roof Example
[IMAGE]


a.    Configuration. Roofs with no visible slope are acceptable. Eaves are required on all street-facing facades.

b.    Eave Depth. Eave depth is measured from the building facade to the outermost element of the eave. Eaves shall have a minimum depth of eighteen inches.

c.    Eave Thickness. Eave thickness is measured at the outside edge of the eave, from the bottom of the eave to the top of the eave. Minimum eave height is eight inches.

d.    Interrupting vertical walls are facade walls below the eave that extend upwards through and above the top of the eave with no discernible cap.

i.    No more than one-half of the front facade can consist of an interrupting vertical wall.

ii.    Vertical walls shall extend no more than four feet above the top of the eave.

e.    Occupied Space. Occupied space shall not be incorporated within this roof type.

5.    Towers. A tower is a rectilinear or cylindrical vertical element, that must be used with other roof types; towers are only allowed on permitted building types and on corner lots. For lots with two corners, the tower is only permitted on the corner with the primary street. A stair tower used for emergency and roof access is exempt from this limit. See Figure 6.13.

Figure 6.13

Tower Example
[IMAGE]


a.    Quantity. All building types, with the exception of the civic building, are limited to one tower per building.

b.    Tower Height. Maximum height, measured from the top of the lower parapet or eave to the top of the tower, is limited to one and one-half times the height of the upper floor of the building on which the tower is located. The tower is not included in the count for maximum number of stories.

c.    Tower Width. Maximum width along all facades is one-third the width of the front facade or thirty feet, whichever is shorter.

d.    Horizontal Expression Lines. A horizontal expression line shall define the tower from the upper stories, except on single family or attached house residential building types.

e.    Occupied Space. Towers may be occupied by the same uses allowed in upper stories of the building type on which they are located. Occupied space within a tower shall not count towards any other rooftop occupied space allowance.

f.    Application. May be combined with all other roof types.

g.    Tower Cap. The tower may be capped by the parapet, pitched, or flat roof types.

H.    Lighting Standards.

1.    Light Source. Light sources shall be at least as efficient as LED and no greater than 4,000K in correlated color temperature (CCT).

2.    Light levels shall be designed such that light trespass measured at the property line does not exceed 0.01 foot-candles.

3.    Light fixtures shall use a cut-off luminaire that is fully or partially shielded with no light distributed above the horizontal plane of the luminaire or into nearby residential structures.

4.    In no case shall the total lumens emitted for a single site exceed one hundred thousand lumens per acre.

5.    Parking Lot Lighting. Parking lot lighting shall be designed and constructed to comply with the following standards:

a.    Pole Height/Design.

i.    Luminaire mounting height is measured from the parking lot or driveway surface and may range from ten feet to thirty feet, based on review of site plan, proposed land uses, surrounding land uses, parking area size, building mass, topography of site, and impacts on adjacent properties.

ii.    Poles and fixtures shall be black, dark brown, or another neutral color approved by the community development director.

iii.    All attempts shall be made to place the base of light poles within landscape areas.

iv.    Light poles in parking areas shall not exceed thirty feet in height. Poles exceeding twenty feet in height are appropriate only for parking areas exceeding two hundred stalls and not in close proximity to residential areas.

6.    Other Outdoor Lighting Standards.

a.    Wall-mounted lighting fixtures shall not be located above eighteen feet in height unless being used as building accent lighting. Fixture styles and finishes shall complement the building exterior.

b.    Lighting located along pedestrian pathways or in areas primarily dedicated to human activity shall be bollard-style lighting or down-directed lighting not to exceed twelve feet in height. Pedestrian lighting shall be coordinated through each project and shall complement adjacent projects to the greatest extent practical.

c.    In order to avoid light pollution, backlit awnings, up-light spotlights, and floodlights are prohibited.

d.    Street lighting shall either be chosen from the city’s approved streetlight list or installed to match a theme set by developments within the zone or neighborhood.

7.    Upgrading Preexisting Lighting. An applicant must bring preexisting lighting into compliance with this code upon application with the business license department for a change in ownership, new business in a stand-alone structure or in a multi-tenant structure in which the new business utilizes more than fifty percent of the building square footage on the site, in conjunction with an application for a building permit for any alteration, remodel or expansion of any structure on the site, or in conjunction with changes to the approved site plan.

8.    Lighting Plan Submission Requirements. A lighting plan is required for all developments and must contain the following:

a.    Plans indicating the location on the premises, and the type of illumination devices, fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors, installation and electrical details;

b.    Description of illuminating devices, fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors, and other devices that may include, but is not limited to, manufacturer catalog cuts and drawings, including section where required; and photometric data, such as that furnished by manufacturers, or similar showing the angle of the cutoff or light emission;

c.    A point-by-point light plan to determine the adequacy of the lighting over the site.

I.    Additional Design Standards. This section outlines the town center design standards that affect a building’s appearance and quality. The intent is to improve the physical quality of buildings, enhance the pedestrian experience, protect the character of the neighborhood, create visual interest, and contribute to its sense of place.

1.    Materials and Color.

a.    Primary Street-Facing Facade Materials. A minimum of eighty percent of each facade shall be constructed of primary materials. For facades over one hundred square feet, more than one material shall be used to meet the eighty percent requirement. Permitted primary building materials include high quality, durable, natural materials, such as stone; brick; wood lap siding; fiber cement board; lapped, shingled, or panel siding; or glass. Other high-quality synthetic materials may be approved by the community development director during the site plan process.

b.    Secondary Street-Facing Facade Materials. Secondary materials on primary street-facing facades are limited to details and accents and include gypsum reinforced fiber concrete for trim and cornice elements; metal for beams, lintels, trim, and ornamentation; and exterior architectural metal panels and cladding. Exterior insulation and finishing systems (EIFS) are permitted for trim only or on upper floor facades, up to twenty percent of total.

c.    Roof Materials. Acceptable roof materials include three-hundred-pound, or better, dimensional asphalt composite shingles, wood shingles and shakes, metal tiles or standing seam, slate, and ceramic tile. “Engineered” wood or slate may be approved during the site plan process with an approved sample. Membrane roofs are acceptable for flat roofs with no surface visible from the street.

d.    Color. Main building colors shall be complementary to existing building stock, where applicable.

e.    Appropriate Grade of Materials. Commercial-quality doors, windows, and hardware shall be used on all building types with the exception of the row building type.

f.    Restricted Materials List.

i.    Vinyl or aluminum siding, highly reflective metal, mirrored windows, and plain cement block materials are prohibited.

ii.    Stucco is only permitted when used on facades that do not face public streets, adjacent residential areas, or open space.

2.    Windows, Awnings, and Shutters.

a.    Windows. Transparency requirements vary by building type.

b.    Awnings. All awnings shall be canvas, metal, glass, or wood. Plastic awnings are not permitted. Awning types and colors for each building face shall be coordinated. Awnings shall provide a minimum of an eight-foot vertical clearance above ground plane.

c.    Shutters. If installed, shutters, whether functional or not, shall be sized for the windows. If closed, the shutters shall not be too small for complete coverage of the window. Shutters shall be wood or metal. “Engineered” wood may be approved during the site plan process.

3.    Drive-Through Structures. Drive-through structures are not permitted in any form district or with any building type.

4.    Meters and Equipment Placement. Equipment shall be screened from view and not located on a public frontage.

5.    Waste Containers. Waste containers shall be located out of public view and screened with landscaping and/or a structure that is compatible with the theme of the adjacent building.

17-7-11.7 Open space.

A.    General Requirements.

1.    Intent. To provide open space as an amenity that promotes physical and environmental health within the community and to provide each household with access to a variety of active and passive open space types.

2.    Applicability. Open space types are permitted, not permitted, or limited according to each form district. See Table 7.01.

Table 7.01

Open Space Type by Form District

	Open Space Type	Form District

	MS 	TCC

	Pocket Park 	P 	P

	Town Square 	P 	P

	Park 	P 	P

	BTZ Pedestrian Space 	L 	L

	 

	P = Permitted 	N = Not Permitted

	L = Limited by Building and Frontage Type

3.    All open spaces shall meet the following general requirements:

a.    All open spaces within the Main Street FBC district shall comply with one of the open space types as defined in this section.

b.    All open space types shall provide public access from a vehicular and/or pedestrian right-of-way.

c.    Pocket park, town square, and park open spaces shall be platted as a parcel or group of parcels or, with permission from the city, may be located within a right-of-way.

d.    Unless prohibited, open space types may incorporate fencing; provided, that the following requirements are met:

i.    Fencing shall be a maximum height of three feet unless approved by the community development director for such circumstances as proximity to railroad right-of-way or use around swimming pools, ball fields, and ball courts.

ii.    Fence opacity shall be no greater than sixty percent. Landscaping is exempt from this opacity requirement.

iii.    Chain-link fencing is not permitted, with the exception of dedicated sports field or court fencing as approved by the community development director.

iv.    If a fence is built along a street front, openings, with or without gates, shall be provided on each individual street front with a minimum spacing of one opening every one hundred feet or a minimum of one opening on street fronts that are less than one hundred feet.

e.    Ownership of all open space types may be either public or private.

f.    Parking shall not be required for an open space type, unless a use other than open space is determined by the city.

g.    Continuity of connections to existing or planned trails or open space types shall be made when the open space abuts key trail corridors or another open space type.

4.    Requirements.

a.    The following further explains or defines the requirements for each open space type. Refer to Tables 7.02 through 7.05 for the specific requirements of each open space type.

b.    Dimensions.

i.    The minimum area of all open space types is measured within the lot lines of the property.

ii.    The maximum area of all open space types is measured within the lot lines of the property.

iii.    The minimum dimension requirement is a way to make sure that the size of an open space is not too small for its particular open space type. The minimum dimension for all open space types is derived from overlaying the open space plan with two straight lines that intersect at right angles and whose endpoints are at the outer property lines. The first line is placed at the longest distance across the open space. The second line crosses the first line at a right angle at the place on the first line that follows the longest distance in the direction perpendicular to the first line. The “minimum dimension” is the shorter of these two lines. Figure 7.01 shows three examples of measuring the minimum dimension.

Figure 7.01

Minimum Dimension Measurement Examples
[IMAGE]


c.    The minimum access requirement ensures access and visibility for the open space. It is described in two ways:

i.    The percentage of the total perimeter that must be adjacent to a public right-of-way.

ii.    The minimum number of and/or spacing between access points into the open space.

d.    Adjacent lots are those which are directly adjacent to or directly across the street from an open space.

i.    The adjacent form district requirement places a restriction on open spaces which are located adjacent to a form district boundary. The given open space type is permitted to be adjacent to the listed form district(s).

ii.    The preferred orientation of adjacent lots is toward the open space. The given open space type is permitted adjacent to, or across the street from, the listed property line type(s).

e.    Improvements of the following types may be permitted in an open space:

i.    Sports fields are fields or courts that are designed for one or more specific sports.

(A)    Sports fields areas are limited in size, expressed as a maximum percentage of the total park area.

(B)    Paved sports courts do not count toward pavement requirements.

ii.    Playgrounds are defined areas with play structures and equipment, such as slides, swings, and climbing structures, typically for children under twelve years old.

iii.    Structures.

(A)    Fully enclosed inhabitable structures are permanent structures with a roof and walls with closeable doors that fully enclose the space. They are intended for uses such as, but not limited to, park offices, maintenance sheds, community centers, and restrooms.

(B)    Open-air inhabitable structures are permanent structures with a roof or overhead covering and partially or fully open sides. Examples include, but are not limited to, gazebos, pavilions, pergolas, and shade structures.

(C)    Landscape structures are permanent uninhabitable structures that are used for aesthetic purposes or active uses that are not a sports field/court or playground. Examples include, but are not limited to, water features, monuments, sculptures, splash pads, climbing walls, and skate parks.

iv.    The pavement requirements are expressed as percentages of the total area of the open space, as measured within the lot boundaries. Paved areas may use impervious and/or semi-pervious paving materials. Three percentages are given:

(A)    The minimum total area is the smallest permitted paved area and includes the sum of both impervious and semi-pervious paved areas.

(B)    The maximum total area is the largest permitted paved area and includes the sum of both impervious and semi-pervious paved areas.

(C)    The maximum impervious pavement area is the largest area permitted to be paved with impervious paving materials. This maximum impervious pavement percentage is lower than the maximum total percentage so the use of semi-pervious areas are required to reach the maximum total paved area. With no minimum for impervious paved area, the maximum total area may be reached by using only semi-pervious materials.

(D)    Paved sports courts are not counted in the pavement requirement percentages.

v.    Lighting makes open spaces useful after sunset and improves nighttime safety. Each open space type requires lighting, but the amount and type of lighting differs with each open space type and design. Except as required in this section, lighting in open spaces shall be subject to the same lighting standards as buildings.

vi.    Seating is an important component of all open spaces; it encourages people to stop and spend time in the open space rather than just pass through and allows people with different mobility and physical needs to enjoy the open space. Each open space type requires seating, but the amount and type of seating differs with each open space type and design. The following principles apply to open space seating:

(A)    Seat counts for manufactured seat furniture shall be counted according to the manufacturer’s specifications. For built-on-site seating, such as seat walls, steps, and benches, each two feet of linear seating shall be considered one seat.

vii.    “Landscaping” refers to areas that are planted with live plants. These areas are subdivided into lawns (expanses of turf grass) and planted areas (plants that are not turf grass). Trees can be planted in both lawns and planted areas. Landscape designs will vary widely between open space types and are based on specific site characteristics and design goals.

viii.    Bicycle facilities located in open spaces are an important part of the active transportation network. The amount and type of bicycle facilities differs with open space type and design. The following principles apply to open space bicycle facilities:

(A)    Bicycle rack locations shall be convenient to rights-of-way or other connections to the active transportation network, be visible in the daytime and well-lit at night in order to deter bike theft.

(B)    Each bicycle rack shall have an appropriate amount of clear space around it so that loading and unloading a bicycle from the rack shall not impede any adjacent pedestrian walkway.

(C)    Bicycle racks with permanent coverings are encouraged.

f.    BTZ pedestrian space is the space between the primary facade of a building and the adjacent right-of-way property line when the facade is located within the BTZ and away from the property line. BTZ pedestrian space is not required. Buildings with primary facades located directly on the right-of-way property line have no BTZ pedestrian space.

i.    BTZ pedestrian space regulations apply only to the general, limited bay, and civic building types and only along primary frontages.

ii.    Depth is measured from the right-of-way property line, perpendicular to the property line, to the portion of the building facade that is furthest from the property line.

iii.    May include paved areas and/or planted areas.

(A)    BTZ pedestrian spaces must include paved walkways/driveways to all pedestrian and vehicular entrances in the facade.

(B)    Planted areas shall be enclosed with six-inch-high curbing.

(C)    Trees are not permitted in any BTZ pedestrian space.

iv.    Must be open to the street and shall only be enclosed by the primary building facade.

(A)    Shall not be enclosed with any overhead roof structure or building mass. Shade structures are permitted.

(B)    Shall not be enclosed with any fencing, walls, or hedges.

v.    Shall be open to public use.

5.    Stormwater in Open Space Types. Stormwater management structures, such as storage and retention facilities, may be integrated into open spaces and used to meet stormwater requirements for surrounding lots.

a.    Stormwater features in open spaces may be designed as formal or natural amenities with additional uses other than stormwater management, such as an amphitheater, sports field, or a pond or pool as part of the landscape design. Stormwater features shall not be fenced and shall not impede public use of the land they occupy.

b.    A qualified professional such as a landscape architect, certified landscape designer, or civil engineer shall prepare and/or review plans for any open space that incorporates stormwater features.

B.    Pocket Park.

1.    Intent. Pocket park areas may be appropriate in certain areas of the district. These parks may be very narrow or otherwise constrained in ways that would make a more traditional larger park unfeasible.

2.    General Requirements. Pocket parks should be strategically located, if possible. Pocket parks are a valuable temporary use on lots that are undeveloped. Regulations for the pocket park open space type are defined in Table 7.02.

C.    Town Square.

1.    Intent. A high-quality town square space can become the “heart” of a community, when located effectively and with the right amount of attention given to how the space is used and designed. Town squares do not need to be large in size but should be well located in the most highly concentrated and pedestrian-oriented parts of the community.

2.    General Requirements. Town squares should be well designed, and located in visible and easily accessed places.

a.    Town squares shall be fronted by public streets or primary building facades and surrounded by activity on all sides.

b.    Town squares may not be located behind parking lots.

c.    Regulations for the town square open space type are defined in Table 7.03.

The Midvale City general plan identifies the Fort Union area and 7200 South corridor between I-15 and State Street as “opportunity areas” of the city. Opportunity areas are defined as those where changes in the types and/or intensities of current land uses are anticipated. Encouraging a mix of residential and commercial uses is important to provide the critical mass necessary to support the existing commercial, attract new, viable businesses to the area and support the growth of the region. This overlay zone implements the goal of supporting and enhancing existing commercial areas by providing standards for the development of medium and high density residential and mixed-use developments within the regional commercial zone. This chapter informs the owners of the standards that will be applied in approving or disapproving proposed developments. A development plan including site layout, parking, landscaping, architecture and relationship to the surrounding commercial development shall be submitted along with a request to apply the residential overlay zone to any parcel within the regional commercial zone.

To utilize the regional commercial residential overlay, it must be demonstrated the proposed development fulfills the following goals:

A.    Provides critical mass necessary to help facilitate the transition of regional commercial shopping centers into vibrant mixed-use developments;

B.    Creates a consistently high quality urban environment;

C.    Enhances the investment of those locating within the regional commercial zone;

D.    Promotes economic development by increasing the utilization of existing parcels within current developments;

E.    Eliminates large underutilized surface parking areas by utilizing alternate parking methods, including but not limited to structured parking and shared parking;

F.    Provides compatibility between residential and commercial uses to create a comfortable environment for both shoppers and residents; and

G.    Provides pedestrian connections within and among developments to support pedestrian activity in existing auto-oriented developments and encourages pedestrian movement. (Ord. 2016-07 § 1 (Att. A) (part))

c.    Compact spaces with dimensions of nine feet wide by sixteen feet long may be provided. These spaces are not code spaces for the purpose of satisfying parking requirements.

6.    Grading and Drainage. Parking shall be graded and constructed as follows:

a.    Parking areas must be graded for proper drainage with surface water diverted to keep the parking area free of accumulated water and ice;

b.    Adequate control curbs must be installed to control drainage and direct vehicle movement;

c.    Parking area drainage must be detained on site, treated (if required by NPDES), and channeled to a storm drain or gutter as approved by the city engineer;

d.    Driveways may not exceed a ten percent slope.

7.    Street Access and Circulation. New development shall provide the following:

a.    Off-Street Parking. Off-street parking areas must have unobstructed access to a street or alley. The parking area design for five or more vehicles must not encourage cars to back onto adjoining public sidewalks, parking strips, or roadways. With the exception of permitted tandem parking, parking spaces shall be independently accessible and unobstructed.

b.    Corner Lots. No landscape obstruction is allowed in excess of two feet in height above street grade within the sight distance triangle. A reasonable number of trees with lower branches pruned to six feet to permit automobile drivers and pedestrians an unobstructed view of the intersection may be allowed by administrative permit.

c.    Driveway Access. For corner lots, the triangular area is defined by the intersection of the road right-of-way, the line extending from the point-of-curve at the top-back-of-curb, and a line connecting them at points twenty-five feet from their intersection.

d.    Drive-Through Developments. Applicants for all drive-up or drive-through service windows or facilities must provide sufficient stacking space for vehicles waiting for service, to prevent vehicles from waiting in the right-of-way.

e.    Common Driveways. To encourage the location of parking in the rear yard and/or below grade, the city allows common driveways along shared side yards to provide access to parking if the owner restricts the deeds to both properties to preserve the shared drive in perpetuity.

f.    Off-Street Loading Spaces. Every structure that is to be used for any purpose which involves the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise by vehicle must provide and maintain adequate space for standing, loading, or unloading services off street.

ii.    Loading docks and loading areas must be screened from adjoining property and public rights-of-way.

C.    Parking Garages and Structures. Parking garages and structures shall meet the following standards:

1.    Parking structures shall include pedestrian walkways and connections to the sidewalk system. These shall be clearly marked and continuous in design. 

2.    This zoning ordinance is intended, among others, to encourage the use of parking structures and discourage the use of surface parking. Therefore, the planning commission may waive one or all of the following requirements if an architect can demonstrate that the requirement in question is not feasible and when the architect has utilized other architectural methods to blend the structure with neighboring structures and screen the visual impacts of the structure.

a.    Parking structures shall contain ground level retail, office or display windows along all street-fronting facades of the parking structure. Parking structures with street frontage in primarily residential areas may utilize residential units or residential architecture that reflects surrounding residential units to mask the visual impact of the parking structure.

b.    Parking structures that are not located adjacent to or within clear sight of a public street or other major transportation thoroughfare shall utilize plant material as screening to minimize the visual impact of the parking structure.

c.    Parking structures shall be designed with an architectural theme similar to the adjoining structures. Openings that face and can be seen from major vehicular and pedestrian thoroughfares shall be of similar size and, whenever possible, shape to those found on adjacent buildings.

d.    Walls, materials, patterns, colors, roof forms, and front entryways shall conform to the standards for all buildings in the applicable project area and shall reflect those used for adjacent buildings.

e.    Parking stalls shall be a minimum of nine feet by eighteen feet.

f.    The minimum aisle width is twenty-four feet.

g.    The parking structure must be designed to ensure that each required parking space is readily accessible, usable and safe for automobiles and pedestrians.

h.    Parking stalls located adjacent to walls or columns shall be one foot wider than the minimum required width to accommodate door opening clearance and vehicle maneuverability.

D.    Access Management. All new development and an expansion by more than twenty-five percent of an existing building mass or site size shall comply with the following access management standards:

1.    All driveways and curb cuts shall be installed according to the standards and specifications contained in the Midvale City Construction Standards and Specifications handbook. Curb cuts for pedestrian access shall orient toward each street frontage.

2.    All newly installed driveways shall align with any existing access across the street. The planning commission may allow deviations to the requirement, provided the city engineer finds the driveway to be acceptable based on but not limited to access placement, traffic generated, and pedestrian and vehicular circulation.

3.    New development or modifications to existing development shall not propose parking in such a way that users may be allowed to back onto public rights-of-way.

4.    Existing nonconforming driveways within the zone shall be retired upon construction of a new building or the expansion of the area of an existing building or site by twenty-five percent or more.

5.    Shared driveways between and among parcels are encouraged and allowed if the parties execute and record an easement, or a deed of dedication, in a form approved by the city attorney to ensure access in perpetuity for both parcels. (Ord. 2019-06 § 1 (Att. B) (part); Ord. 2016-07 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-12.1.6 Architectural standards.

All new development must present an attractive streetscape, incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale, and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. 

A.    Height. The maximum height for a structure is eighty-five feet to the highest occupied floor plate. The highest occupied floor, roof, parapet, elevator overruns and stairs may exceed the height limit up to thirty feet. Building design and orientation should consider exposure to sunlight to avoid energy inefficiencies.

B.    Ground Floor Materials. Other than windows and doors, eighty percent of the remaining ground floor wall area shall be clad in durable materials. Durable materials include brick, masonry, textured or patterned concrete and/or cut stone. Other materials may be used as accent or trim provided they cover twenty percent or less of the ground floor adjacent to a street. Other materials may be approved at the discretion of the planning commission.

C.    Podium Parking. No more than two levels of podium style parking above grade may be provided, and must be approved by the planning commission based upon the applicant providing architectural design and materials that address pedestrian scale. 

D.    Ground Floor Glass. The ground floor elevation facing a street or drive shall not have less than sixty percent glass surfaces for commercial and office uses and forty percent for residential uses between three and eight feet above grade. All ground floor glass shall be nonreflective and allow visibility into the building. The planning commission may allow for a reduction in the amount of transparent glass if the applicant can demonstrate the building floor plan(s) required by the use cannot effectively accommodate this requirement and other architectural elements are used to (1) create visually interesting facades, (2) avoid large areas of blank facades, and (3) provide a human scale and details.

E.    Ground Floor Uses. On the ground floor, a permitted or conditional use other than parking shall occupy at least seventy-five percent of the width of any street facing building facade. The planning commission may reduce or eliminate this requirement based on architectural design, landscaping and siting.

F.    Maximum Length of Blank Walls. The maximum length of any blank wall uninterrupted by windows, doors, art or architectural detailing at the ground floor level along any street or drive facing facade shall be fifteen feet. Changes in plane, color, texture, materials, scale of materials, patterns, art, or other architectural detailing are acceptable methods to create variety and scale as are architectural features such as bay windows, recessed entrances or windows, balconies, cornices, columns, or other similar architectural features. The architectural feature must be either recessed or project a minimum of twelve inches.

G.    Stucco. The use of stucco should be limited to architectural relief and shall not exceed twenty-five percent of a front elevation or fifty percent of any elevation. The planning commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, the architectural detail and excellence of a structure is such that the use of stucco in excess of this standard is warranted.

H.    Prohibited Materials. Vinyl and aluminum siding products are prohibited as wall materials.

I.    Color Scheme. The use of a single color scheme, minimal detailing, or blank (or largely blank) walls is not permitted. 

J.    Screening. Trash collection and recycling areas, service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall be screened on all sides so that no portion of such areas is visible from public streets and alleys and adjacent properties. Required screening may include new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof.

1.    All building equipment and service areas shall be located on the roof of the building or in the rear yard. These elements shall be sited to minimize their visibility and impact, or screened and enclosed as to appear to be an integral part of the architectural design of the building. Measures shall be taken to mitigate noise impacts on adjacent properties.

2.    Refuse containers shall be screened from view on all sides. Required screening may include new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof. Screening fences, walls and/or plantings shall be one foot higher than the object to be screened. An opaque gate shall be included where required to complete screening. (Ord. 2016-07 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-12.1.7 Utilities.

All utilities within the proposed development shall be buried. The owner shall install conduit within the development’s proposed right-of-way for the eventual burial of overhead utilities throughout the zoning district. If the planning commission finds, upon the review and recommendation of the city engineer, that such installation is not feasible at the time of development, the applicant shall bond for the future installation of said conduit. All underground conduit shall be installed in conformance with city standards as identified in city construction standards and specifications. (Ord. 2016-07 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-12.1.8 Development agreement.

A development agreement, in a form satisfactory to the city attorney and city council, shall be required for new development to ensure the property owner complies with the provisions of the overlay, conditional use permit and site plan approvals, and allowing the property owner the right to develop in accordance with the approved plan for a period up to, but not exceeding, fifteen years. (Ord. 2017-09 § 1: Ord. 2016-07 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-12.1.9 Signage.

All signage shall comply with Section 17-7-12.10. Residential structures shall be allowed one additional monument sign interior to the site. These signs shall comply with the following:

Table 17-7-12.1.9 Signs 

	Monument*	32 s.f.	6' (total)	At least 1 foot of pedestal. May be placed on berm, w/top of sign ≤ 9'; 3' max. height in clear view triangle; ≥ 3' from sidewalk

*    A monument sign under this provision shall not exceed thirty-two square feet or six feet in height with a minimum one-foot pedestal, and shall be located in a landscaped area associated with a project entry or focal point. The applicant may forgo the one-foot pedestal if the landscaped area is improved with something other than turf. The sign may be located on a berm provided the top of the sign does not exceed nine feet in height above finished grade. Monument signs shall not be constructed within the clear view area and shall be set back at least three feet from a public sidewalk and property lines. The sign shall have, as the prominent feature, the name of the development (i.e., “Midvale Village,” “Midvale Plaza,” etc.). It is intended that the top two feet of the sign area be utilized to identify the name of the development. All other lettering shall be no taller than four inches in height.

Benches and shelters installed by the Utah Transit Authority or other public agencies shall be exempt from the payment of a fee. A change in the text of the sign for the bench or shelter or a substitution of benches or shelters shall not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee if the bench or shelter is placed in the same location as originally permitted.

g.    Revocation and Removal. The issuance of a permit to locate a bench or shelter within the city of Midvale creates only a license, revocable upon a showing of cause by the city, and shall create no permanent rights of any kind. Each bench or shelter must be removed within fourteen days of written notification. Benches or shelters not moved within the fourteen-day period will be removed by the city at the owner’s expense. Removal expense per bench shall be calculated based on using a two-man crew and one truck for one hour.

A fee shall be paid for said permit for each newspaper or ad stand as provided in Resolution 02/26/02C. The permit shall be valid for one calendar year. A substitution of newspaper or ad stands shall not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee if the newspaper or ad stand is placed in the same location as originally permitted.

e.    Revocation and Removal. The issuance of a permit to locate a newspaper or ad stand within the city of Midvale creates only a license, revocable upon a showing of cause by the city, and shall create no permanent rights of any kind. Each newspaper or ad stand must be removed within fourteen days of written notification. Newspaper or ad stands not moved within the fourteen-day period will be removed by the city at the owner’s expense. Removal expense per stand shall be calculated based on using a two-man crew and one truck for one hour. (Ord. 2015-13 § 1 (Att.

Due to the special considerations given to this overlay zone area, based on proximity to existing residential neighborhoods and less intensive zoning in the Jordan Bluffs development the following uses, which are allowed in the CI zone, are prohibited:

A.    Automobile assembly;

B.    Vehicle repair;

C.    Sexually oriented business;

D.    Storage units;

E.    Transfer stations. (Ord. 10/19/2004O-32 § 1 (part), 2004)

All new development must present an attractive, coordinated streetscape, incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale, incorporate interior pedestrian access between structures to minimize pedestrian travel through parking areas and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians by constructing pedestrian crossings with stamped, dyed, or raised walks. All new development shall comply with the following architectural standards:

A.    New Building Form. Structures shall be designed to relate to grade conditions with a minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls. The design shall create easy pedestrian access from adjacent uses, on-street parking, sidewalks and parking areas. Commercial buildings shall be designed with ground floor architectural separation to enhance street activity and “walkability.” All proposed building designs must incorporate an expansive use of windows, balconies, terraces, or other design features, which are oriented to the street and other pedestrian accesses, to maximize the pedestrian interface. Windows, display windows and doors must comprise at least forty percent of street-facing facades on the commercial developments with first-floor commercial uses. Blank facades are not allowed to face public rights-of-way and may not exceed thirty feet in length on all other facades.

B.    Walls. All exterior walls shall be constructed in compliance with the following:

1.    Building/Retaining Walls. No more than three materials shall be used for primary wall surfaces.

17-7-15.1 Purpose.

The purpose of the State Street overlay zone is to encourage, facilitate and allow the redevelopment of the State Street corridor, and to:

A.    Facilitate transition of the State Street corridor from undeveloped, underdeveloped and underused commercial parcels larger than one acre into a more vibrant mix of commercial and residential uses;

B.    Provide an identifiable entry corridor for the city by encouraging high quality, distinctive development;

C.    Promote economic development by encouraging a mix of commercial, retail, high quality office, open space, entertainment, recreation, residential, public and institutional land uses;

D.    Encourage the creation of high quality development including residential, retail, office, and other commercial and public uses in coordinated, visually exciting and durable projects. This overlay zone encourages a coordinated mix of uses and buildings that complement each other and the overall Midvale community;

E.    Improve urban design in the area by providing opportunities for variations in architectural design and housing types including multiple unit living where full amenities are available;

F.    Promote pedestrian connections within developments and between adjacent neighborhoods;

G.    Coordinate urban design and streetscape elements in order to create a distinctive visual quality for the area;

H.    Require thematic landscaping to provide a distinctive visual quality to the area;

I.    Manage parking and access in a manner that enhances pedestrian safety, pedestrian mobility and quality urban design; and

J.    Assure and enhance the investment of property owners in the State Street corridor. (Ord. 6/6/2006O-6 § 1 (part), 2006)


17-7-15.2 Density and area regulations.

A.    Minimum Area. Because this chapter is intended to encourage the redevelopment of the State Street corridor and not as an alternate means of using existing parcels and buildings, the State Street overlay zone shall not be applied to any area less than two and one-half acres.

B.    Residential Density. The maximum residential density in the State Street overlay zone is thirty dwelling units per acre for areas that do not qualify for the mixed-use provisions herein.

C.    Commercial/Office/Flex/Retail FAR. The maximum floor area ratio for commercial/office/flex and retail uses is 2:1.

D.    Mixed-Use FAR. The maximum FAR for mixed-use buildings that include more than fifty percent of the floor area as residential units is 2.5:1. The maximum FAR for mixed-use buildings that include at least twenty-five percent of the floor area as residential units is 2.25:1. No building shall qualify for this mixed-use FAR bonus unless it contains at least twenty-five percent of the floor area as residential units and the entire ground floor is used for commercial/office/flex/retail uses. Based on a professionally conducted study that shows that the market will not bear the amount of commercial/office/flex and retail, the planning commission may allow up to twenty percent of a ground floor for one or all of the buildings to be used for residential uses. (Ord. 6/6/2006O-6 § 1 (part), 2006)


17-7-15.3 Use tables.

Due to the special circumstances of this overlay zone area, given that this overlay zone is intended to allow for the redevelopment of certain larger parcels on and adjacent to the State Street corridor, the following uses are the only uses allowed in the State Street overlay zone. If a use is not specifically designated, it is prohibited. Uses designated with an asterisk (*) have additional use-specific standards included in subsection (A) of this section.

Building separation may be reduced as follows if Building Code requirements are met: ten feet between one-story structures; fourteen feet between two-story structures; and eighteen feet between three-story structures. 

F.    Residential Architectural Standards. All new residential development must present an attractive streetscape, incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale, and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. All new residential development shall comply with the general architectural standards for the State Street overlay zone and with each of the following architectural standards:

1.    Walls. All exterior walls of all structures shall be constructed in compliance with the following:

a.    Building/Retaining Walls. No more than three materials shall be used for the primary wall surfaces on a building. Exterior finish shall be of traditional, time- and weather-tested techniques. Retaining walls shall be of materials complementary to the building’s materials.

b.    Color Scheme. Wall colors may range from earth tones to colors with some white and gray. Trim around openings may be accent colors. No other wall colors are allowed. The use of a single color scheme, minimal detailing, or blank (or largely blank) walls is not permitted. The use of exterior staircases is discouraged.

c.    Minimum Percentage of Brick or Stone Facades. All single family detached, attached, or other multi-family residential unit combinations shall include a substantial use of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, wood or synthetic wood products and limited amounts of stucco. Vinyl and aluminum siding products are prohibited as wall materials. Bay windows and other architectural elements protruding from the facades may be clad in other materials. 

d.    Building Massing. Buildings that are uniformly three stories or more must step the roof form or interrupt it with other roof elements. The building mass of the elevation can be reduced by offsetting dwelling units, and varying building setbacks and heights.

2.    Residential Roof Form. Roof forms shall be designed in ways, and/or used in combinations to break up large, continuous building forms, particularly for cluster and multiple dwelling structures. Where flat roofs are used, other techniques to provide scale and interest shall be used to refine large, continuous building forms. Long unbroken ridgelines are prohibited.

a.    Generally, for structures lower than forty feet high, gable or hip roofs are preferred for the primary roof form. The primary gable roof slope shall not be less than 5:12 and not less than 6:12 for single family and two family residences.

b.    Secondary roof structures such as porch roofs, roofs over bay extensions, bay windows, etc., may include other roof forms such as shed roofs, and hip roofs in combination with gable roofs. However, the secondary roofs shall be consistent or complementary with the primary roof form. Secondary roofs that slope should not be less than 4:12. Flat roofs may be also appropriate for small areas.

3.    Openings. The following standards apply to openings of all structures:

a.    Entry Doors. Entry doors must face the front yard or, if located on the building side, must be placed within three feet of the front facade. Entry doors must be covered by a roof and must be a primary element of the front of the structure.

b.    Front Entry Feature. All dwelling units or residential buildings shall have an exterior entry that is a prominent, architectural focal point directing people into the unit or building. This feature shall relate to the architecture of the structure and may include porches, stoops, roofs, etc.

c.    Windows. Bay windows shall have from three to five sides.

4.    Garages. Garage doors must be set back a minimum of twenty feet from the property line or sidewalk, whichever is greater, if off-street parking is to occur in the driveway. In all cases where garage doors face a street, the garage door shall be recessed a minimum of two feet behind the front line of the building living area (porches, bay windows, and similar projections not included).

5.    See Section 17-7-15.6 for general architectural standards.

G.    Characteristics of Housing Product.

1.    Minimum Number of Models for Single Family Detached, Attached, or Other Multi-Family Residential Unit Combinations That Appear to Be a Single Large House. Any development of fifty or more units in any of the above listed configurations shall have at least three different types of housing models. Any development of fewer than fifty units of the above listed configurations shall have at least two different types of housing models.

2.    Minimum Model Characteristics for Single Family Detached, Attached, or Other Multi-Family Residential Unit Combinations That Appear to Be a Single Large House. Each housing model shall have at least three characteristics, which clearly and obviously distinguish it from the other housing models, such as different floor plans, exterior materials and colors, roof shapes, garage placement, window size/proportion/pattern, placement of the footprint on the lot, and/or overall building facade design. Only a maximum of fifty percent of street accessed garages shall have garage doors facing the street with the balance being alternative side or rear-loaded and/or detached rear yard garages, etc., except that all opposing block faces shall duplicate the opposite side of the street; only front driveway block faces will face each other, only alley-loaded block faces will face each other. Each such alternatively loaded garage plan will constitute a distinct model for the purposes here.

3.    Single Family Attached (Townhouse). The development of contiguous townhouses is limited to fifty units (i.e., in any single location) and in groupings no larger than eight units each. Any additional development over fifty row-houses may be developed so long as one-third of the total approved units are located on uncontiguous lots, a minimum of one hundred fifty feet or three lots apart in all directions and in groupings no larger than eight units each. Any townhouse development larger than eight units shall provide at least two different unit models. Each unit model shall have at least three characteristics that clearly distinguish it from the other townhouse models.

H.    Required Residential Open Space and Landscaping. All required landscaping shall be installed as a condition precedent to receiving a certificate of occupancy unless seasonal conditions make installation unfeasible, in which case the applicant shall provide cash security or its approved alternative, for all landscaping, which landscaping shall be installed by the following May 31st. The following open space, landscaping and recreational amenities standards are not mutually exclusive and shall apply to all new residential development in the zone:

1.    Minimum Open Space. Active, improved open space is required to meet whichever of the two following standards requires the greatest amount of open space: 

a.    The applicant shall dedicate not less than thirty-five percent of the interior of the proposed development area as open space, or

b.    The applicant shall develop as open space not less than twice as much of the site area as is utilized for surface parking, including the parking stalls, aisles and associated hardscape but not including required parking lot landscaping or private driveways. Surface parking stalls include any dedicated parking spaces not located in the enclosed levels of a parking structure, underneath living spaces, or in a structure attached to a dwelling unit. 

2.    Minimum Landscaped Area. The applicant shall landscape twenty-five percent of the interior of the proposed development area. The required open space may be landscaped to comply with this requirement. Landscaped areas shall not be less than five feet wide. Building foundation landscaping is not interior landscaping. The applicant must landscape a minimum of ten feet between the side yard and the abutting property line when the side or rear yards are in public view.

3.    Minimum Improved, Common Recreational Amenities. A minimum of fifteen percent of the land area shall be developed as active, improved common area to include such uses as mini parks, picnic areas, playgrounds, recreation areas and structures such as club houses, pavilions, swimming pools, etc. Improved, common recreational amenities shall be concentrated into larger, more functional areas as much as possible while continuing to provide each dwelling unit with an amenity within reasonable walking distance.

4.    See Section 17-7-15.7 for further landscaping standards. (Ord. 6/6/2006O-6 § 1 (part), 2006)

A.    Lot Size. No minimum lot size.

B.    Setbacks. New development shall comply with the following setbacks:

1.    Except for property lines along State Street, there shall be no required setback from the property line, except as required by the Building Code and landscaped buffers.

2.    For uses that front State Street, the minimum front yard setback is eight feet, which shall consist of an eight-foot sidewalk. A park strip, located within the right-of-way, shall be provided that is at least five feet wide that may consist of street trees, live ground cover plants or turf or hardscape if tree wells are provided.

3.    For mixed-use buildings, the setback line is also a build-to line.

4.    For uses that access or front on State Street other than mixed-use, a landscaped area up to an additional twenty-two feet may be provided between the eight-foot sidewalk and the front of the building.

5.    Commercial buildings with drive-up windows may have a one-way drive lane located between the sidewalk and building front when the building is located such that only one access to the property is provided. A minimum five-foot landscaped berm must be provided between the sidewalk and drive lane, and the building foundation landscaping shall be provided.

6.    No building shall be set back from State Street more than thirty feet except when more than one building is located on a property, secondary buildings up to fifty percent larger than the building located at the thirty-foot build-to line may be constructed behind the build-to line. All buildings that can reasonably be built at the building line, excluding areas needed for required setbacks, driveways and landscaping, must be located at the build-to line.

C.    Build-To Line. All retail/office/flex and mixed-use structures located in the State Street overlay zone shall address adjacent public roads by being constructed at the build-to line. At least fifty percent of the adjacent facade must be built within three feet of the build-to line when the building is located at its maximum required setback. For those uses for which a flexible setback is allowed, at least fifty percent of the facade must be located within the maximum and minimum setbacks. For the purposes of this section, “build-to line” is defined as the maximum distance a use can be set back from the public right-of-way as required herein.

D.    Height. The maximum height is five stories for portions of the structure more than one hundred feet from a single family detached or attached residential development. If a structure is constructed within seventy-five feet of a single family structure located within a single family residential zoning district, the maximum height shall be forty-five feet for a sloped or forty-two feet for a flat roof.

E.    Retail/Office/Flex and Mixed-Use Architectural Standards. All new development must present an attractive, coordinated streetscape, incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. All new development shall comply with the following architectural standards:

1.    Walls. No more than three materials shall be used for primary wall surfaces. Exterior finishes shall be of traditional, time- and weather-tested techniques. Retaining and screening walls shall be of materials complementary to the building’s materials. Buildings shall use a cohesive palette of colors which complement nearby buildings. Without limiting the use of color, large areas of wall shall be subdued in color and not reflective. Intense colors should be used as accent only.

2.    Roofs. All the roofs and dormer roofs of a building shall be constructed of the same material. Slopes of roofs shall be of equal pitch if a gable or hip roof is employed. All metal roofs must be of a subdued color. Painted roof shingles are prohibited.

3.    Miscellaneous. Security devices shall have materials and colors that complement the building’s architecture and building materials. Accessory structures shall be architecturally compatible with the primary development. Satellite dishes shall not be placed in view from the front yards.

4.    See Section 17-7-15.6 for general architectural standards.

F.    Retail/Office/Flex and Mixed-Use Required Landscaping. The applicant shall professionally landscape the lot, according to an approved landscape plan, as a condition precedent to receiving a certificate of occupancy for all commercial uses. The community development director shall evaluate landscape plans for all permitted uses. The planning commission shall evaluate landscape plans for conditional uses. Landscape plan approval is a condition precedent to issuance of a building permit for the parcel. All landscaping shall be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, unless seasonal conditions make installation unfeasible, in which case the applicant shall provide cash security or its approved alternative, for all landscaping yet to be completed, which landscaping shall be installed by the following May 31st.

1.    Minimum Landscaped Area. Fifteen percent of the interior of each retail/office/flex lot and twenty percent of the interior of each mixed-use lot shall be developed as landscaped setbacks, courtyards, plazas, open space or walkways. Landscaped areas shall not be less than five feet wide. Building foundation landscaping is not interior landscaping. The applicant must landscape a minimum of ten feet between the side yard and the abutting property line when the side or rear yards are in public view.

2.    See Section 17-7-15.7 for further landscaping standards. (Ord. 6/6/2006O-6 § 1 (part), 2006)


17-7-15.6 General architecture standards for the State Street overlay zone.

A.    Exterior Structure. All exterior walls of all structures shall be constructed in compliance with the following:

1.    All buildings shall use one or more of the following durable materials as significant finish: architectural pre-cast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, brick cladding, natural and cast stone, architectural metals, and glazing. Architectural site-cast concrete may be allowed if designed, articulated, and colored for a finished appearance on all buildings. At least fifty percent of all buildings visible from State Street shall be composed of brick, brick cladding, stone, architecturally treated CMU, and/or architectural pre-cast concrete. 

2.    High standards for exterior materials, exterior building systems, and their application are expected. In particular, the design, and application of EIFS or synthetic stucco is expected to be of a high enough quality to allow for crisp detailing and substantial relief. The use of EIFS on ground floor walls shall be limited to the surface area three or more feet above finished grade. The wall area from finished grade to where the use of EIFS begins shall be clad by a hard durable material such as brick, stone, architectural pre-cast concrete, or architecturally treated concrete masonry units.

3.    Buildings shall provide variation in the form of facades that adjoin streets. Variations should result from significant dimensional changes in plane, color or detail as accomplished by such devices as protruding bays, recessed entries, upper level step-backs, arcades, offsets in the general plane of the facade, changes in materials or color, bay windows, vestibules, porches, balconies, exterior shading devices, nonretractable canopies or awnings, projecting cornices, or eaves.

4.    Primary public entry(s) shall be architecturally emphasized so that pedestrians can easily find them.

5.    Use awnings or canopies to reduce glare on storefront glass and to shelter the pedestrians standing near the storefront. Cantilever awnings and canopies from the building face so as to keep sidewalks as clear and unobstructed as possible.

6.    Drive-through windows shall be located at the side or rear of buildings. While not desirable, a drive aisle may be located between the building and the street so long as its width is minimized, any pedestrian crossings of it are clearly delineated with special paving treatments, no parking spaces occur off of it and a low wall, railing with landscaping, or a continuous hedge at least three feet high exists between stacked cars and the sidewalk.

7.    Opaque (solid) storefront security closures (rolling doors, etc.) are not allowed.

8.    Weather Protection. Weather protection features such as awnings, canopies, doors inset by at least three feet, or arcades shall be provided at all customer entrances.

9.    Facade Features. All large retail building facades visible from public streets shall include architectural treatments that add detail and character, and reduce the appearance of massive blank walls. Techniques such as color and material changes, expression of structure, shifts in plane, offsets and projections, belt courses, reveals, pilasters, windows, doors, arcades, canopies, and other similar elements may achieve this standard.

10.    Parapets. Large building roofs shall have parapets and enclosures concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment from public view. Parapet and enclosure materials shall match the building in quality and detail.

11.    Building Orientation. Building facades that face the street but do not have pedestrian entries shall be composed of high quality materials such as brick or stone, and shall provide variety and interest in the facade through the introduction of such elements as pilasters, recessed or protruding bays, changes in materials and/or colors, building lighting elements, display windows with products or product graphics, transparent windows or clerestories, and well-designed signs and graphics. Service areas, mechanical equipment, meters and trash containers shall be completely screened from the street.

12.    Entryways. Each large retail building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring a combination of several elements such as:

a.    Canopies, awnings or porticos.

b.    Projecting eaves and cornices.

c.    Recesses/projections of wall surfaces.

d.    Arcades.

e.    Raised parapets over the door.

f.    Peaked roof forms.

g.    Lighting features.

h.    Entry plazas.

i.    Display windows.

j.    Architectural details such as masonry tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure and design.

k.    Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaping.

l.    Signs integrated with the building architecture.

B.    Unifying Elements.

1.    Unifying Elements Required. Each development must contain elements that tie the development together with an overall theme or themes. Developers shall utilize public spaces, open spaces, the relationships between buildings, scale and architecture of the buildings, public art and statuary, trail systems, plazas, pedestrian crossings, lighting or lighting fixtures, benches, trash receptacles, bicycle storage, other site furnishings, way-finding markers and other community signage, landscaping, trees and other plantings to create a sense of place that unifies the site by creating a distinct identity. The theme should, to the greatest extent possible, be compatible with the look and feel of other developments created under this chapter. Locations for mail delivery, bus stops and other informal gathering places should receive special attention when providing elements that unify the development.

2.    Planning Commission Evaluation. The planning commission shall evaluate the thematic ties within a development plan during the large scale master planned development phase of the approval process. The planning commission may withhold approval of the large scale master plan approval if they feel that the unifying elements within the development are inadequate to meet the intent of this chapter until an acceptable theme can be approved. Developments that have already been granted large scale master plan approval by the planning commission as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be evaluated for compliance with this section by the department of community and economic development staff.

3.    Final Site Plan Approval. The developer shall include these elements in the landscaping plans, development layout and other plans included in the site plan packages for small scale master plan approval. The planning staff shall evaluate each final site plan for compliance with the unifying elements as approved by the planning commission.

C.    Roofs. All the roofs and dormer roofs of a building shall be constructed of the same material. Slopes of roofs shall be of equal pitch if a gable or hip roof is employed. All metal roofs must be of a subdued color. Painted roof shingles are prohibited.

D.    Openings. The following standards apply to openings of all structures: 

1.    Main Entry. The main entry into multi-tenant and multi-family structures shall be redesigned through architecture and landscaping to create a prominent focal point directing people into the buildings.

2.    Entry Doors. Entry doors must face the front yard or, if located on the building side, must be placed within three feet of the front facade. Entry doors must be covered by a roof and must be a primary element of the front of the structure.

3.    Windows. Bay windows shall have from three to five sides.

4.    Corner Buildings. Special attention shall be given to corner buildings that are highly visible, that may serve as landmarks, and provide a sense of enclosure at intersections. Special attention can be achieved by architecture, landscape, and public place.

E.    Fences, Hedges, and Walls. The following standards apply to new development of fences, hedges and walls:

1.    Required Setbacks. A fence, hedge, wall, column, pier, post, or any similar structure or any combination of such structures is permitted in the required setback of a zone district if it meets the following conditions:

a.    All fences and walls meet the requirements of Title 15, Building and Construction;

b.    No fence, hedge, or wall extends beyond or across a property line without a recorded agreement with the abutting property owner;

c.    Reserved; and

d.    No barbed wire or other sharp, pointed, or electrically charged fence may be erected or maintained, except a temporary fence on a construction site to protect the property during the period of construction may be topped with barbed wire where the barbed wire is not less than eight feet above the ground and does not extend more than two feet above the temporary fence.

2.    Height. No fence or wall may exceed seven feet in height, four feet in height from the front of the primary structure forward, nor three feet in the clear view triangle, measured as follows: 

a.    In a required yard abutting a street, the total effective height above the finished grade measured on the side nearest the street;

b.    In any other required yard, the total effective height above the finished grade measured on the side nearest the abutting property;

c.    On a property line, measured from the finished grade of either side when the abutting property owners are in agreement;

d.    A temporary fence on a construction site may be as high as required to protect the property during the period of construction; and

e.    Any fence within ten feet of a driveway shall not exceed three feet in height for the first ten feet behind the sidewalk.

3.    Athletic Facilities. Fencing around athletic facilities, including, without limitation, tennis courts, may be ten feet in height so long as all portions above six feet are constructed with at least fifty percent non-opaque materials.

4.    Conformance with This Section. No person shall construct, alter, or maintain a fence, hedge, wall, column, pier, post, or any similar structure or any combination of such structures except in conformance with all of the requirements of this section.

F.    Reserved.

G.    Screening. Trash collection and recycling areas, service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall be screened on all sides so that no portion of such areas are visible from public streets and alleys and adjacent properties. Required screening may include new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof. 

1.    For nonresidential and mixed-use structures, all roof-mounted mechanical and electrical equipment, communication antennas or dishes shall be screened from the view of a pedestrian at the far side of adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less, or designed and/or located as part of the overall architectural design.

2.    For residential structures, roof-top mechanical equipment, vents, flues, fans and other pieces of equipment shall be screened and/or organized to leave sloped roofs as simple and uncluttered as possible, or, where roofs are flat, to be screened from view of a pedestrian at the far side of the adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less. Where such appurtenances are visible, they shall be painted a color that matches the roof color or other architectural features so that their visual impact is minimized. 

3.    Refuse containers shall be screened from view on all sides. Screen walls and fences shall be one foot higher than the object to be screened. An opaque gate shall be included where required to complete screening.

4.    Loading docks and/or service areas shall be located to the side or rear of buildings. Where they are directly visible from streets, and nearby residential buildings, they shall be screened by walls at least eight feet high, or densely and continuously massed landscaping that maintains its screening capabilities in the winter. Raised planters, berms or other land forms may also be used in conjunction with landscaping or walls. A combination of dense, continuous landscaping and walls may allow the use of lower walls, but no lower than four feet high from finished grade.

17-7-16.8    Related provisions.


17-7-16.1 Purpose.

The purpose of the public facilities overlay zone is to provide for locations and appropriate standards for a range of public uses conducted by governmental and specified agencies. These uses are operated for the benefit of the community, and provide basic services and essential support services for the community. Because of the nature of these uses, they are generally not identified with any specific zone district, having the need to locate in areas that best serve the community. The overlay zone allows the city council, through its legislative discretion, to provide for areas in which to locate public facilities to best support the community in a cost effective and efficient manner. It is the intent of this overlay to protect neighboring private uses from incompatible public uses and ensure the impacts associated with the public uses are appropriately mitigated. (Ord. 2012-18 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-16.2 Public facilities.

The following are defined as public facilities, and may be allowed in a public facilities overlay zone. These public facilities must be operated by a governmental or specified agency. If a facility is not specifically designated, it cannot be considered under this overlay.

A.    Government buildings.

B.    Fire station.

C.    Police station.

D.    Park/playground.

E.    Recreation and community center.

F.    Library.

17-7-16.3 Review process.

The review process for all applications intended to utilize the public facilities overlay zone shall follow the process outlined in Section 17-3-1, Amendments to the zoning code or map. The application shall include a binding site plan, which shall be reviewed in conjunction with the proposed use. The public facilities overlay rezone is contingent upon approval of the site plan. The site plan shall include the information required in Section 17-3-3(E), Site Plan Review. (Ord. 2012-18 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-16.4 Criteria—Required findings.

The planning commission may recommend and the city council may grant approval of a public facilities overlay zoning designation only if it determines, in written findings, the application has demonstrated the following:

A.    There is a demonstrated need for the public facility within the community at large and it is not contrary to the public interest.

B.    The public facility is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan, and applicable ordinances of the city where feasible.

C.    The public facility is located, planned and developed in such a manner that it is not inconsistent with the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing or working in the city. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

1.    The generation of noise, noxious or offensive emissions, or other nuisances which may be injurious or detrimental to the surrounding area.

2.    The availability of public services to support the public facility, including utilities; vehicular, pedestrian and public transit systems; police; fire; education; and social and health services.

3.    The adequacy of landscaping, screening and buffering, building setbacks, parking, open space, or other development characteristics necessary to mitigate the impact of the public facility on neighboring properties.

4.    Proposed public facilities which exceed the bulk, height, density, or other use standards in the underlying zone must demonstrate such variances are essential to the function or operation of such facility. The development standards of the underlying zone and adjacent development shall be utilized where feasible.

D.    The public facility complies with the specific review criteria for the use contained herein. (Ord. 2012-18 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-16.5 Development agreement.

The city council may find that a proposed public facility requires a development agreement to ensure the use and facility continue to operate in the manner consistent with the development approval. In this instance, a development agreement, in a form satisfactory to the city attorney and city council, wherein the property owner and service provider agree to comply with the provisions of the development approval, including any required on-site and off-site public improvements associated with the development, shall be made part of the development approval process. (Ord. 2012-18 § 1 (Att. A) (part))


17-7-16.6 Specific review criteria for certain public facility uses.

In addition to the foregoing, the following criteria must be satisfied in order to approve an application for each of the following uses:

17-7-17.1 Purpose.

The Midvale City general plan identifies the areas around TRAX stations as “opportunity areas” of the city. Opportunity areas are defined as those where changes in the types and/or intensities of current land uses are anticipated. Encouraging a mix of residential and commercial uses is important to provide the critical mass necessary to support the existing commercial, attract new, viable businesses to the area and support the growth of the region. This overlay zone implements the goal of supporting and enhancing existing areas by providing standards for the development of high quality, higher density residential, commercial and mixed-use developments within the transit-oriented development zone. This chapter informs the owners of the standards that will be applied in approving or disapproving proposed developments. Due to the urban nature of this overlay zone as a result of the increased density and building height, additional mitigating standards are included to supplement the standards of the transit-oriented development (TOD) zone. A development plan including site layout, parking, landscaping, architecture and relationship to the surrounding development shall be submitted.

The goals for developing within the transit-oriented development zone overlay include the following:

A.    Provides critical mass necessary to help facilitate the reinvestment and redevelopment of the existing commercial base within the transit-oriented development zone and surrounding commercial areas;

B.    Takes advantage of transit and existing transit opportunities;

C.    Creates a consistently high quality urban environment;

D.    Provides pedestrian connections within and among developments and between adjacent neighborhoods to create a walkable area;

E.    Enhances the investment of those locating within and around the transit-oriented development zone;

F.    Respects the existing development pattern through a variation in height, form and scale;

G.    Provides compatibility between residential and commercial uses to create a comfortable environment for both shoppers and residents;

H.    Promotes economic development by increasing the utilization of existing undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels. (Ord. 2017-04 § 1 (Att. A) (part))

However, the secondary roofs shall be consistent or complementary with the primary roof form. Secondary roofs that slope should not be less than 4:12. Flat roofs may be also appropriate for small areas.

c.    Front Entry Feature. All dwelling units or residential buildings shall have an exterior entry that is a prominent, architectural focal point directing people into the unit or building. This feature shall relate to the architecture of the structure and may include porches, stoops, roofs, etc.

d.    Garages. Garage doors must be set back a minimum of twenty feet from the property line or sidewalk, whichever is greater, if off-street parking is to occur in the driveway. In all cases where garage doors face a street, the garage door shall be recessed a minimum of two feet behind the front line of the building living area (porches, bay windows, and similar projections not included). The style, materials, colors and roofs used in the construction of accessory structures, including garages and carports, shall be architecturally compatible with the primary structures.

3.    Parking Enclosures. Parking enclosures/structures should be constructed within the same structure as the dwelling units whenever possible. Parking enclosures/structures shall be held to the same architectural standards as the residential structures.

M.    Screening. Trash collection and recycling areas, service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall be screened on all sides so that no portion of such areas is visible from public streets and alleys and adjacent properties. Required screening may include new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof.

1.    For residential structures, roof-top mechanical equipment, vents, flues, fans and other pieces of equipment shall be screened and/or organized to leave sloped roofs as simple and uncluttered as possible, or, where roofs are flat, to be screened from view of a pedestrian at the far side of the adjoining right-of-way or one hundred feet from the front property line, whichever is less. Where such appurtenances are visible, they shall be painted a color that matches the roof color or other architectural features so that their visual impact is minimized.

2.    Refuse containers shall be screened from view on all sides. Required screening may include new and existing plantings, walls, fences, screen panels, doors, topographic changes, buildings, horizontal separation, or any combination thereof. Screening fences, walls and/or plantings shall be one foot higher than the object to be screened. An opaque gate shall be included where required to complete screening.

17-7-17.5 Retail, office and mixed-use architectural standards.

All new development must present an attractive, coordinated streetscape; incorporate architectural and site design elements appropriate to a pedestrian scale; incorporate interior pedestrian access between structures to minimize pedestrian travel through parking areas; and provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians by constructing pedestrian crossings with stamped, dyed, or raised walks. All new development shall comply with the following architectural standards:

A.    New Building Form. Structures shall be designed to relate to grade conditions with a minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls. The design shall create easy pedestrian access from adjacent uses, on-street parking, sidewalks and parking areas. Commercial buildings shall be designed with ground floor architectural separation to enhance street activity and “walkability.” All proposed building designs must incorporate an expansive use of windows, balconies, terraces, arcades or other design features, which are oriented to the street and other pedestrian accesses, to maximize the pedestrian interface. Windows, display windows and doors must comprise at least forty percent of street-facing facades on the commercial developments with first-floor commercial uses. Blank facades are not allowed to face public rights-of-way and may not exceed thirty feet in length on all other facades.

B.    Walls. No more than three materials shall be used for primary wall surfaces. All exterior walls shall be constructed in compliance with the following:

1.    Materials. Exterior finishes shall be of traditional, time- and weather-tested techniques and shall include a substantial use of brick, cultured brick, natural or cultured stone, prairie stone, and/or wood or synthetic wood products. Glazing may be used as a primary exterior material when glazing is proposed as a major architectural design element or look for a project area consisting of at least two buildings and including all of the buildings that are separated by a major feature such as a linear park, collector street, or similar element that sets an area apart. Retaining and screening walls shall be of materials complementary to the building’s materials.

2.    Stucco. The use of stucco, synthetic stucco and EIFS should be limited and shall not exceed fifty percent of any elevation. The planning commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the architectural detail and excellence of a structure is such that the use of stucco in excess of this standard is warranted.

3.    Other Architectural Materials/Finishes. Architectural precast concrete, architecturally treated concrete masonry units, and architectural metals should be used primarily to provide architectural detail and relief. Fiberglass and/or metal panels may be used in relatively small quantities. The planning commission may allow other materials and material quantities that it finds add to the architectural excellence of the structure and project.

4.    Prohibited Materials. Vinyl and aluminum siding products are prohibited as wall materials.

5.    Base Materials. Each structure shall have a base or foundation with a minimum height of one-third the overall height of the structure. The base or foundation shall extend beyond the plane of the wall above it, creating a larger mass at the base of the building. The planning commission may allow for minor deviations to allow this base to terminate at visual breaks in the architecture, and the planning commission may approve alternative materials that are the qualitative equivalent of brick, cultured brick, or natural or cultured stone.

6.    Brick and Rock Pattern. Ledge stone, uncoursed ledge rock, random or coursed ashlar Flemish bond, English bond, common bond, running bond or drystack patterns shall be used for finished brick, rock and stone work.

Chapters:

26.04    General Provisions

26.08    Employment Discrimination

26.12    Housing Discrimination

26.16    Offenses, Investigation and Enforcement


Chapter 26.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sections:

26.04.040    No private right of action—No special rights.

26.04.050    Severability.

26.04.060    Definitions.


26.04.010 Purpose.

A.    Every individual in the city has the right to work and earn wages through gainful employment. Discriminatory employment practices are detrimental because they impede the social and economic progress of the city by preventing all of the city’s citizens from contributing to or fully participating in the cultural, spiritual, social and commercial life of the community, which is essential to the growth and vitality of the city’s neighborhoods and businesses. The Utah Antidiscrimination Act, Section 34A-5-101 et seq. of the Utah Code Annotated, addresses employment-related discrimination based on race, color, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or pregnancy-related conditions, religion, national origin, age (if forty years of age or older), and disability, but does not address discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

B.    Every individual in the city has the right to seek housing. Discriminatory housing practices are detrimental because they impede the social and economic progress of the city by preventing all of the city’s citizens from contributing to or fully participating in the cultural, spiritual, social and commercial life of the community, which is essential to the growth and vitality of the city’s neighborhoods and businesses.

C.    The Utah Fair Housing Act, Section 57-21-1 et seq. of the Utah Code Annotated, addresses housing-related discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, source of income, and disability, but does not address discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

The city has found that discrimination in employment and housing on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity must be addressed. The denial or deprivation of employment rights and access to housing because of an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the city’s citizens and damages the city’s economic well-being. The purpose of this title is to provide a clear and comprehensive mandate for the prevention and elimination of discrimination in employment and housing in the city against individuals based upon sexual orientation or gender identity and this title shall be liberally construed to achieve that purpose. (Ord. 2011-02 § 2 (part))


26.04.020 Administration.

The city manager is responsible for administering and implementing this chapter. (Ord. 2011-02 § 2 (part))


26.04.030 Antidiscrimination board.

A.    The city manager is authorized to establish the antidiscrimination board and to appoint the three members of the board.

B.    The term of each board member shall be determined by the city manager.

C.    Any member of the board may be removed by the city manager at any time. The city manager shall select the chair of the board.

D.    The board may adopt rules of policy and procedure for the governing of meetings, its members, and the performance of its duties. (Ord. 2011-02 § 2 (part))


26.04.040 No private right of action—No special rights.

This title does not create a private cause of action, nor does it create any right or remedy that is the same or substantially equivalent to the remedies provided under federal or state law. This title does not create any special rights or privileges which would not be available to all of the city’s citizens because every person has a sexual orientation and a gender identity. (Ord. 2011-02 § 2 (part))


26.04.050 Severability.

If any section, sentence, paragraph, term, definition or provision of this title is for any reason determined to be illegal, invalid, superseded by other authority or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any state or federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such determination shall have no effect on the validity of any other section, sentence, paragraph, term, definition or provision of this chapter, all of which will remain in full force and effect. (Ord. 2011-02 § 2 (part))
