BENBROOK, TEXAS MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Benbrook, Texas 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 12, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Benbrook, Texas Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1985, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direct supervision of Pat Rutherford, city secretary. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 12, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1440 , passed April 4, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 12, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 12, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use.

We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

c.  The premises shall be kept in a sanitary condition and reasonably free of animal waste parasites, insects and flies that could be harmful to the animals' health and/or to the health of the general public. 
d.  The premises must provide adequate protection (as determined by the animal control officer) from the common elements, i.e., rain, heat, cold; 
2.  The animals kept were causing a stench or odor which is offensive to a person of ordinary sensibilities on adjoining, adjacent or neighboring premises; or

B.  A property owner shall be permitted to maintain a horse or other livestock upon his or her property only if he or she is in the possession of a valid permit issued by the city. Revocation of a permit by the animal control officer will require removal of the animal or animals from the property owner's lot or tract within twenty-four hours. 
C.  In the event that the animal control officer shall identify a violation of any provision of the terms of this chapter, he or she may in his or her sole discretion cite the property owner for a misdemeanor violation of the terms of this chapter rather than revoking the permit itself. At the time that a citation is issued, the animal control officer shall notify the property owner of the provision of this chapter allegedly violated and shall provide the property owner with a list in writing of those deficiencies which must be corrected. The animal control officer may then at his or her sole discretion make follow-up reinspections to ensure that corrective action has been taken to resolve the violation. At such point in time as the animal control officer determines that the issuance of misdemeanor citations is not producing corrective action to eliminate the alleged violation of this chapter, the animal control officer may revoke the permit.

If a written appeal of permit revocation is filed with the city secretary, a hearing shall be held before a committee composed of the city manager, the director of community services and the director of public safety. The hearing shall occur within seven working days of the receipt of the written appeal. The property owner appealing the decision of the animal control officer shall be entitled to appear and present such evidence and witnesses as the property owner deems appropriate to demonstrate that the permit was improperly revoked. The animal control officer will appear and present such evidence and/or witnesses as he or she deems appropriate to demonstrate why the revocation of the permit was necessary. At the conclusion of the appeal hearing, a decision will be rendered by the review committee and such decision shall be binding on all parties. 
E.  The animal control officer shall be authorized to reissue or authorize the reissuance of a permit for the keeping of domestic livestock on an individual property owner's property in those cases where a previous permit has been revoked, providing that such reissuance by the animal control officer is based on a finding that previously identified violations have been fully corrected. The authority of the animal control officer to allow reissuance of a previously revoked permit shall be subject to the restriction that if any property owner's permit to maintain domestic livestock has been revoked three times previously, it may not be reissued irrespective of subsequent corrective action take by the property owner.

Chapter 10.52 - ROAD HUMP POLICY FOR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS 
Sections: 

10.52.010 - Definitions.

    "Application" means the written initial request and the petition submitted by a resident or representative of a neighborhood group. 
    "Residential dwellings" means and includes single-family houses, townhouses and duplexes. 
    "Road hump" means a geometric design feature of a roadway, consisting of a raised area in the roadway pavement surface extending transversely across the travelway, whose sole purpose is to reduce the speed of vehicles traveling along that roadway. 
    "Street" means the street segment that must be petitioned. It should be a continuous street between two intersecting streets and should be a minimum of one thousand feet in length. 
(Ord. 986 § 1 (part), 1996) 
10.52.020 - Eligibility requirements. 
    Many factors must be considered in locating road humps for optimal effectiveness. Isolated humps provide only point speed reductions and do not achieve an overall speed reduction effect. Site details should be the dominant consideration in determining the actual location of each road hump rather than an exact separation distance. All of the following criteria must be satisfied for a street to be considered eligible for road hump installation: 
A.  A petition documenting that a minimum of seventy-five percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street support installation of the requested road hump(s); 
B.  The street where the road hump is proposed must be composed primarily of residential dwellings; 
C.  Conditions for locating road humps, including operational and geometric characteristics of the street, are as follows: 
1.  The street must be a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
2.  The street must be paved. If the road hump is located on a street with no curb and gutter, then a special design must be used to prevent vehicles from driving around a road hump. 
3.  The street pavement width can be no wider than thirty-six feet wide. 
4.  There must be no more than one moving lane of traffic in each direction. 
5.  Traffic volumes must be more than four hundred vehicles per day but less than three thousand vehicles per day. 
6.  The street must not be identified as a primary route for emergency vehicles. Primary emergency routes include, but are not limited to, the streets identified as collectors and thoroughfares on the thoroughfare plan and are subject to change. 
7.  The street must have a speed limit of thirty miles per hour or less in accordance with state law. 
8.  Vehicle speed must equal or exceed an eighty-fifth percentile speed of five miles over the posted speed limit. 
9.  The street must have adequate sight distance to safely accommodate the hump(s) as determined by the public works and police departments. 
10.  The street must not have curves or grades that prevent safe placement of the hump(s). Road humps may be located on streets that contain curves and/or grades but the hump itself must be located not less than two hundred feet from any horizontal curve with a radius of one thousand feet or less. The vertical grade of the street may not exceed eight percent. 
11.  The elevation of property adjacent to a hump location must be above the top of the curb, or as determined by the engineering department, to minimize potential flooding due to the presence of the hump in the roadway. 
12.  A road hump must be located downstream of a drainage inlet. 
13.  A road hump must be placed perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
14.  A road hump must not be installed within one hundred fifty feet of an intersection. 
15.  A road hump should be located at property lines rather than in front of a residence; however, it must not be located in front of a property if the owner objects to its placement or, in the case of a property containing multiple dwellings, if a majority of the households on the property object to its placement. It is the responsibility of the applicant(s) to obtain approval from the property owner or majority of households to place road humps on property lines or in front of a residence. 
16.  A road hump should not be located at driveways or between ends of a loop driveway that presents an attractive run-around route. 
17.  A road hump must not be located over manholes, gate valves, utility vault accesses and similar features. 
18.  A road hump should be installed to take advantage of existing street lighting, where possible. 
(Ord. 986 § 1 (part), 1996) 
10.52.030 - Cost of road humps. 
    The city manager shall establish the current estimated cost of road humps, based on information provided by contractors and by city staff. The estimated cost shall include asphalt, markings, signage and a reasonable contingency factor, but shall not include labor. Special design features may result in additional costs. 
(Ord. 986 § 1 (part), 1996) 
10.52.040 - Cost responsibility. 
    The cost for the road hump installation (including signs, pavement markings and, if necessary, special design features such as curbing or guard rail) and/or removal is the property owner's responsibility. The property owners shall be responsible only for the actual cost, and any excess funds deposited over and above the actual cost shall be returned to the land owners. The cost for transportation engineering studies and maintenance of the road hump is the responsibility of the city. The term "property owner," when used in cost sharing, does not necessarily refer to the petitioners, but is used to define the share of the cost that is not the responsibility of the city and should be paid by one or more of the residents or from other private resources. The city council reserves the right to waive the cost in cases of financial hardship. 
(Ord. 986 § 1 (part), 1996) 
10.52.050 - Design standards and procedures 
    The city manager shall prepare and maintain current design standards and installation procedures for road humps in accordance with this chapter. 
(Ord. 986 § 1 (part), 1996) 
10.52.060 - Procedure for road hump installation.

City Manager 
Re: Road Hump Program 
City of Benbrook 
911 Winscott Road 
Benbrook, TX 76126 
B.  Upon receipt of the request, a preliminary determination of eligibility based on compliance with this chapter and available traffic data will be made in a timely manner. If necessary, the city shall conduct traffic counts and speed studies to determine eligibility. 
1.  If the street is determined not to be eligible, the applicant will be notified in writing of the reason for the denial. 
2.  The decision may be appealed in writing to the city manager within fifteen days of the notification date. The city manager will review the determination and respond to the applicant within thirty days of the appeal request. Any subsequent petitions must show the reason for the original denial. 
3.  If the street is determined to be eligible for consideration of road hump installations, a meeting will be arranged between the applicant and staff to determine the petition area, the approximate road hump locations, and the total estimated cost. The petition area generally will include all property owners fronting on the affected street, plus property owners with frontage on adjacent connecting streets within two hundred feet of the affected street. The applicant will then be instructed to submit a petition containing the signatures of seventy-five percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street in support of the installation of the road humps and to provide funds to cover the estimated cost of the road humps. Only petition forms (Exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter) supplied by the city or photocopies of petition forms may be used for this purpose. The basis for the cost estimate shall be made available to the petitioners upon request. 
C.  Upon receipt of the petition and a check for the estimated road hump cost, the city secretary will verify the legitimacy of all signatures and notify all property owners within the petition area in writing of the intent to proceed with installation of the road humps. The notice will include a return form to indicate support or objection to the proposed installation. 
D.  If owners of twenty percent or more of the real property within the notification area object to the installation within thirty days of the notice, the street will then be removed from the list of streets eligible for road hump installation and a public hearing will be scheduled with the city council for further consideration. The city manager's office will notify the applicant, the owners of all property within the study area and the area neighborhood associations of the public hearing. 
E.  If objections from less than twenty percent of the real property owners within the notification area are received or the city council approves the installation after a public hearing, then the humps will be installed as scheduling permits. 
F.  Upon completion of the road hump installation, the public works department shall prepare an accounting of the actual cost for road hump installation, excluding labor. If the actual cost was less than the estimated cost, then the difference shall be refunded to the applicant for distribution among the contributors. 
G.  In lieu of payment to the city, the petitioners may request authorization to hire their own contractor to install the road humps at their own expense. Any contractor shall be approved by the city, provide appropriate bonding and liability protection, and construct the road humps in accordance with city design standards and specifications. 
(Ord. 986 § 1 (part), 1996) 
10.52.070 - Road hump removal/alteration. 
    The process for road hump removal or alteration by the property owners is the same as the process for installation. Eighty percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street must sign a petition in favor of removal. The cost for removal or alteration will be determined by the city and is the property owners' responsibility to pay.

Where an accessory structure is attached to a principle structure in a substantial manner by a wall or roof, such accessory structure shall be considered part of the principle structure. 
    "Principle structure(s)" means a structure or structures arranged, adapted or designed for the predominant or primary use for which a lot may be utilized. 
(Ord. 718 § 1, 1985) 
12.28.020 - Display of address required. 
    The owner, occupant or person otherwise in control of any commercial, industrial or residential building or group of buildings located within the city shall cause a street address to be displayed on that structure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 718 § 2, 1985) 
12.28.030 - Securing a street address number designation. 
    The owner, occupant or person otherwise in control of any commercial, industrial or residential building or group of buildings may secure the correct street address to be displayed in accordance with the provision of this ordinance from the building inspection department of the city. 
(Ord. 718 § 3, 1985) 
12.28.040 - Method of displaying street address. 
A.  The owner, occupant, or person otherwise in control of any commercial, industrial or residential building or group of buildings located within the city, shall display a street address indicating the numeric street address designation of the principle structure, principle structures, or group of structures. Numbers shall be of a contrasting color to the structure itself and placed on the face of the building fronting upon the street or approved private access area from which the building is addressed. Numbers may be placed on the door of the structure or any portion of the wall facing the street or approved access area provided that they are clearly visible from a motor vehicle located in the street or approved access area. Numbers may not be obscured by vegetation or architectural decor. Numbers shall be located in such a position that they can be detected and identified during the hours of darkness or limited visibility. 
B.  Displays of street addresses shall be affixed and maintained in accordance with the following provisions: 
1.  Single-family, duplex and quadraplex dwellings shall have numbers at least four inches in height displayed on the side of the dwelling facing the street on which the dwelling is numbered. In cases of rural situated dwellings or dwellings with extended "setbacks" which are not readily visible from the public street or approved private access area, additional house numbers shall be displayed at the drive entrance of its intersection with the public street. 
2.  Multistructure, multifamily dwellings shall display the complex unit number and apartment number on each dwelling. Numbers shall be at least eight inches in height. 
3.  Industrial and commercial buildings shall display numbers at least eight inches in height. 
C.  Any dwelling or structure located in the city which, at the time of the passage of the ordinance codified by this chapter has existing numbers displayed thereon which satisfy all of the provisions of this chapter except the provisions pertaining to the height of the numbers displayed on such dwellings or structures, may continue to use the existing, nonconforming numbers until such numbers are altered or removed therefrom.

(Ord. 718 § 4, 1985) 
12.28.050 - Curb numbering. 
    It shall be permissible to place street address numbers on the curb of a lot frontage to assist in further identifying the address of a principle structure or group of structures. Curb numbering alone shall be insufficient to meet the requirements of this ordinance. It has been determined by the city council that curb numbering provides insufficient means of identification due to the frequent parking of motor vehicles in such a manner as to prevent viewing of a curb number. Where curb numbering is utilized, a background area at least six inches in height must be painted onto the curb face with reflective paint in a color specifically designed to contrast with the color used in placing the numbers indicating the address. 
(Ord. 718 § 5, 1985)

    The city may also bring suit for injunction against any person, firm or corporation that violates or threatens to violate any of the provisions of this chapter, in order to prevent a continued violation or threatened violation.

2.  Provide stormwater (drainage) facilities and services for real property in the city on payment of stormwater charges, except such real property which may be exempted therefrom as authorized by law; and 
3.  Offer such drainage (stormwater) service on non-discriminatory, reasonable and equitable terms. 
B.  Duty of City Engineer. It shall be the duty of the city engineer to administer the stormwater utility system. The city engineer shall keep an accurate record of all properties benefited or served by the stormwater utility system and the stormwater utility fee charged for each parcel or portion of a parcel. The record may be maintained within the city's or its contractor's utility billing system or in other record keeping systems that may be developed. 
C.  Program Implementation. By the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city makes no representation that all of stormwater problems will be remedied; and the city council is given full discretion in establishing the time and quantitative priorities in expending funds on a reasonable basis as the same become available to meet the stormwater needs of the city. The adoption of this chapter shall not be construed to relieve private land owners, developers or other individuals or entities from providing stormwater improvements pursuant to the ordinances of the city and the laws of this state which relate to stormwater or stormwater improvements. Further, the city does not waive any immunity granted under any law. 
D.  Access to Benefited Properties. Employees of the city shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any benefited properties served by the stormwater utility system for inspection or repair or enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and Chapter 402, Subchapter C, Local Government Code. 
(Ord. 1240 § 2, 2007) 
13.12.030 - Establishment of a stormwater utility fee and billing. 
A.  Stormwater Utility Rate Classes. A stormwater utility fee is established, and the fee shall be imposed on each benefited property within the city for services and facilities provided by the stormwater utility system. For purposes of imposing the stormwater utility fee, all eligible parcels within the city are classified into the following categories: 
1.  Residential; 
2.  Nonresidential. 
B.  Responsible Party. 
1.  The stormwater utility fee shall be billed monthly along with other utilities provided to the property, including water, wastewater or solid waste (garbage) services. 
2.  The bill imposing the stormwater utility fee will be mailed to either the owner or customer who is currently established as the responsible party for water, wastewater and solid waste service for the parcel; and, the owner or customer recorded in the utility billing system will be responsible for payment of the fee. 
3.  Where an improved parcel is not occupied by a customer that might use water, wastewater, solid waste or other utility service and considered by the city to be vacant, either on a temporary or permanent basis, the city may bill the owner of the parcel for the stormwater utility fee. 
4.  Where a parcel is not billed for water, wastewater, solid waste or other service to an owner or customer of the city or BWA, the city is hereby authorized to establish a "stormwater only account" and to bill the stormwater utility fee to either the owner or customer, as the city engineer determines is appropriate. 
C.  Revision of Rates. The city council shall establish the initial rates for the stormwater utility fee by ordinance. The city council may review the schedule of rates at any time and may, by ordinance, increase or decrease the rates within the schedule, upon a determination that said increase or decrease is warranted. 
D.  Billing Procedures and Policies. 
1.  Any partial payment of the stormwater utility fee will be applied against the amount due in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the city and BWA with regard to all utility services provided by the city or BWA. 
2.  A late charge and interest may be imposed in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the city or BWA with regard to all utility services. 
E.  Nonpayment. The city may file suit to recover any charges due hereunder, together with maximum interest, attorney fees and other costs and charges that may be allowed by the act or other law, which is not paid when due. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by law or in this chapter, failure of a customer or owner of the stormwater utility system to pay the charges promptly when due shall subject such customer or owner to discontinuance of any utility services provided by the city and/or placement of a lien against the property. 
(Ord. 1240 § 3, 2007) 
13.12.040 - Calculation of stormwater utility fees. 
A.  Rates in Accordance with Act. The stormwater utility fee shall be established in accordance with the provisions of the act, including, but not limited to, Section 402.047, which states that the basis must be directly related to drainage and the terms of the levy, and any classification of the benefited properties in the municipality must be nondiscriminatory, equitable, and reasonable. 
B.  Fee Calculation. The stormwater utility fee shall be based on an inventory of parcels within the city which also evaluates the stormwater runoff potential on those parcels and establishes a rate for each class of property. The stormwater utility fee shall be set to recover the cost-of-service that has been established for the stormwater utility system in a fair and equitable manner, and if so determined by the city council, an amount to establish one or more funds to provide financing for future stormwater system construction and for implementing programs to improve stormwater quality. The proportional stormwater runoff potential for each class shall be distributed equitably between classes and among the parcels in each class in proportion to the relative contribution of stormwater runoff from each class. 
C.  Stormwater Runoff Potential. For purposes of establishing the stormwater runoff potential on parcels between and within each rate class, the impervious area for parcels shall be inventoried from information established by Tarrant County appraisal district, from geographic information system records, from aerial photography and from site plans or plats available for properties within the city. The impervious area measured in square feet as obtained from these database sources, site plans or other survey or engineering calculations shall be used to establish the relative stormwater runoff potential for each rate class and among parcels within each rate class. 
(Ord. 1240 § 4, 2007) 
13.12.050 - Appeal. 
A.  Appeal of Stormwater Utility Fees to the City Engineer. An owner or customer who has been charged a stormwater utility fee and believes that the calculation or determination of the stormwater utility fee is incorrect may appeal the fee determination to the city engineer.

3.  After October 1, 2008, the city engineer shall issue a decision on the appeal within thirty days from the date that the city engineer receives the appeal. An adjustment resulting from such a request shall be prospective and applied to future billings and may also be retroactive for no more than three months prior to the receipt of the appeal. 
4.  The city engineer shall issue a written decision on an appeal. 
B.  Supporting Information for Appeal. The person filing the appeal may be required, at the person's cost, to provide supplemental information to the city engineer, including but not limited to survey data sealed by a Texas licensed professional land surveyor, engineering reports sealed by a Texas licensed professional engineer qualified in civil engineering, or other documentation that the city engineer deems necessary to properly evaluate the appeal. Failure to provide requested information in a timely manner may result in denial of the appeal. 
C.  Appeal of Stormwater Utility Fees to the City Council. 
1.  An owner or customer may appeal the following decisions of the city engineer to the city council: 
a.  The applicability of a stormwater utility fee for a parcel; 
b.  The calculation of applicable stormwater runoff potential for a parcel; 
c.  The calculation of the stormwater utility fee for a parcel; or 
d.  The discontinuance of utility service, filing of a lien or other legal actions for nonpayment of stormwater utility fees. 
2.  The owner or customer shall file a written appeal to the city council with the city secretary within thirty days following receipt of the city engineer's decision. The city council shall hear the appeal within sixty days of receipt of the appeal by the city secretary. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the address given in the appeal form or, if no address is given, to the address on the utility billing statement at least fourteen days prior to the hearing. 
3.  The burden of proof shall be on the owner or customer to demonstrate that the fee is not applicable or that the determination of the value of the fee was not calculated according to the applicable stormwater fee schedule or the methodologies established in the stormwater utility fee ordinance and Chapter 1.12 of the City Code. If applicable, and if not previously submitted to the city engineer, the owner or customer shall submit, with the appeal, a report describing the basis for the appeal. The report shall be prepared by a Texas licensed professional engineer qualified in civil engineering. The failure to submit such a report shall be considered in determining whether the applicant has met the burden of proof. 
4.  If the appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient security satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the stormwater utility fee due, any discontinued utility services may be reinstated while the appeal is pending. 
5.  At the hearing, the city council shall allow testimony from the applicant, city employees and other interested persons relevant to the appeal. The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
6.  Following the hearing, the city council shall consider all evidence and determine whether the appeal should be granted (in whole or in part) or denied. 
7.  The city council shall complete its review and make a decision about the appeal within thirty days of the hearing. The city council shall apply the standards and review criteria contained in this section. 
8.  The city council's decision shall be final. 
E.  Imposition and Appeal of Lien. 
1.  Before imposing a lien for delinquent stormwater utility charges, the city shall send notice to the owner of the amount of the charges owed and any penalties or interest accrued, and of the owner's right to appeal the imposition of the lien. The notice must provide a time, place and means by which the charges causing the lien may be paid or disputed. The notice shall be sent to the address shown on the tax rolls if the owner has not notified the city of a different address. 
2.  Within ten working days of the postmark of the notice sent to the owner, the owner may appeal the decision to impose the lien on the property to the city engineer. 
3.  The owner shall present evidence at a meeting with the city engineer. Within five working days after the date of the meeting, the city engineer shall direct that the lien not be filed if he finds the customer or the owner does not owe a fee, and shall give the owner written notice of the decision. 
4.  If warranted, the city engineer may modify the lien to reflect the true amount of delinquency in payment for services to the property. 
5.  When a person pays all principal, interest and all other charges allowed by law that are secured by a lien filed pursuant to this chapter, the city engineer shall execute a release of that lien. 
(Ord. 1240 § 5, 2007) 
13.12.060 - Termination of district. 
    If, after at least five years of substantially continuous operation of the stormwater utility system, the city council determines that the stormwater utility system should be discontinued, the powers under the act should be revoked, and the provision for financing municipal stormwater costs should be made by using other revenues, the city council may adopt an ordinance that in effect, after providing notice and a public hearing as required by the act, discontinues the stormwater utility system. 
(Ord. 1240 § 6, 2007)

Article I. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods 

15.40.005 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses (Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, Section 16.315.) Therefore, the City Council of the City of Benbrook, Texas hereby adopts this Chapter providing for flood hazard protection. 
(Ord. No. 1289, § I, 7-2-09) 
15.40.010 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 1289, § I, 7-2-09) 
15.40.020 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such a water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
G.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 1289, § I, 7-2-09) 
15.40.030 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter employs the following methods, techniques and/or provisions: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

1.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
2.  Variances shall only be issued upon, (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
3.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
K.  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in this section are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

15.40.340 - Areas of shallow flooding. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.40.210 are areas designated as shallow flooding zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may not be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
A.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least two feet above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least four feet if no depth number is specified); 
B.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
1.  Shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least two feet above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least four feet if no depth is specified); 
2.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy; 
C.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Subsection 15.40.290.A.1, are satisfied; 
D.  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 1289, § I, 7-2-09) 
15.40.350 - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.40.210 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provision shall apply: 
A.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.40.310 through 15.40.350. 
C.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, the city may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the city first completes all of the provisions required by 44 CFR 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 1289, § I, 7-2-09) 
Chapter 15.42 - STORM WATER QUALITY 
Sections: 

15.42.010 - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the city of Benbrook by regulating activities that may contaminate storm water runoff. This chapter is intended to promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the city. 
    This chapter also is intended to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of nonstorm water discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this chapter are: 
1.  To manage storm water runoff from any development in order to reduce siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
2.  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by storm water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
3.  Reduce soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety; 
4.  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by storm water discharges by any user; 
5.  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
6.  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
B.  Applicability. This chapter shall apply to all areas of land within the incorporated limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. This chapter shall apply to all water entering the storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the city. 
C.  Disclaimer of Liability. The erosion protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. This chapter does not imply that erosion controls will survive inundation by runoff from storms greater than the design flood for erosion controls. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Benbrook, or any officer or employee for any erosion damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

This section applies to all construction and/or land disturbance activities that exceed five thousand square feet in area, either alone or as part of a larger development, in the city of Benbrook, or its extraterritorial jurisdiction. The provisions of this section shall apply to all property owners, persons, or their agents filling, grading, excavating or otherwise disturbing the surface of real property within the city, whether they be contractors, subcontractors, supervisors, inspectors, managers, agents, employees or otherwise. Failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter shall constitute an offense, and each day such failure continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
    This section shall apply regardless of whether a responsible party is required to obtain a permit from the city in order to conduct such land disturbing or construction activity. The responsible party shall also be held liable for violations of this section committed by third parties engaging in activities related to the responsible party's project. 
B.  Owners Responsibilities. Private property owners, developers or builders shall be accountable for any erosion of their property or construction site that results in accumulation of sediment in dedicated streets, alleys, any waterway or other private properties. Any accumulation or deposit of soil material beyond the limits of the property or in city streets, alleys or drainage facilities in an amount sufficient to constitute a threat to public safety and comfort as determined by the assistant city manager shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
    The property owner shall be responsible for all cleanup operations incidental to the grading, filling, excavation, construction or other disturbance of the surface of real property including leveling, establishment of ground cover, erosion control and removal of all trash or other materials not suitable for fill including those deposited on streets, alleys, utility facilities, rights-of-way or easements. 
    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
    If the property owner fails in any respect to fulfill the requirement of this chapter, the city may go upon the owner's property and perform such work as may be necessary to fulfill such requirements and may level, establish ground cover, construct erosion control, remove all soil, rock, debris and other materials not suitable for fill including those deposited on streets, alleys, utility facilities, rights-of-way or easements, at the property owner's expense and charge same against the deposit of the applicant. If a deposit has not been made with the city, or if the cost incurred by the city exceeds the amount of the deposit, the city shall bill the property owner for the unpaid expenses and if the owner fails to pay the city for such expenses within thirty days of being billed for same, the city shall have the right to place a lien on the owner's property which shall be filed with the county clerk as in the case of paving assessment liens for all amounts expended by the city in excess of the deposit plus interest at the current lawful rate. 
C.  Permits Required. 
1.  Excavation, Grading and Filling Permits. No person shall under take any land disturbance activity for an area that exceeds five thousand square feet without first obtaining a permit from the city of Benbrook in accordance with Section 15.48.020 of this title. 
2.  Erosion Control and/or Storm water Pollution Prevention Plans. 
a.  No person shall be granted a grading permit for a land-disturbing activity that would require the uncovering of five thousand or more square feet without the approval of an erosion control plan and/or storm water pollution prevention plan by the city of Benbrook. 
3.  Submission of NOI to City. The operator of a facility, including construction sites, required to have a NPDES or TPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with construction activity shall submit a copy of the Notice of Intent (NOI) to the assistant city manager at the same time the operator submits the original notice of intent to the EPA or the TNRCC as applicable. The copy of the Notice of Intent may be delivered to the assistant city manager either in person or by mailing it to: 
Notice of Intent to Discharge Storm Water 
Inspections Department 
City of Benbrook 
P.O. Box 26569 
Benbrook, Texas 76126 
    A person commits an offense if the person operates a facility that is discharging storm water associated with construction activity without having submitted a copy of the Notice of Intent to do so to the assistant city manager. 
4.  Erosion Control Deposit Account. 
a.  Land Disturbance Associated with Subdivision Construction. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, when construction or land disturbing activities are conducted as part of a subdivision project, the following shall apply: 
i.  Erosion Control Deposit Account. Prior to approval of the grading permit, the developer shall submit an erosion control plan for approval by city and shall pay an erosion control deposit to the city in the amount of one hundred dollars per lot for single-family residential subdivisions and two hundred dollars per acre for multifamily residential and nonresidential subdivisions. The deposit shall be posted to ensure implementation and continued maintenance of the city-approved erosion control plan for the development as required by this chapter. No inspection of any type may be performed on a project or portion thereof until a city-approved erosion control plan is implemented by the responsible party. 
ii.  Final Acceptance. Permanent erosion control devices and when applicable, temporary erosion control devices, as specified in the approved erosion control plan shall be installed and maintained prior to final acceptance of a subdivision. The developer for such subdivision shall continue to maintain all temporary erosion control devices until permanent erosion control has been established on all those lots within the subdivision for which a building permit has not been issued. 
iii.  Transfer of Property by Developer. If the developer sells all of the lots in a subdivision to one purchaser, that purchaser becomes the responsible party for the subdivision, is liable for violation of this chapter and shall post an erosion control deposit as required by this chapter. The balance remaining in the original developer's account shall be released as provided herein upon the submission of written proof of transfer of lots or a new erosion control deposit by the purchaser. As required by this chapter, the new purchaser shall post an erosion control deposit with city. 
iv.  Deductions from Erosion Control Deposit Account/Stop Work Orders/Citation. City shall inspect the erosion control devices located at a site for compliance with the approved erosion control plan submitted by a developer. If a developer fails to implement or maintain erosion control devices as specified in his approved erosion control plan, city shall provide such party with written notice of noncompliance identifying the nature of the noncompliance. Such notice shall also inform the developer of the circumstances under which a deduction from his deposit account will be made and the time frame for the filing of an appeal of such action by city. The developer shall have twenty-four hours to bring his erosion control devices into compliance with the approved erosion control plan for the site to which notice of noncompliance was issued. Correction shall include sediment clean-up, erosion control device repair, erosion control device maintenance and/or installation of additional erosion control devices to prevent re-occurrence of the violation. The twenty-four hour cure period may be extended for inclement weather or other factors at the discretion of the Inspector. 
    At the end of the twenty-four hour cure period, city shall re-inspect the site and shall deduct a re-inspection fee of one hundred fifty dollars from the developer's erosion control deposit account. If at the time of such re-inspection, the erosion control devices at the site have not been brought into compliance with the approved erosion control plan, city may issue a stop work order and issue a citation for each violation of this chapter. All deductions from a developer's erosion control deposit account may be appealed as provided in this chapter. 
v.  Erosion Control Deposit Account Balance-Deposit Refund. After building permits have been issued for seventy-five percent of the lots within the development, the developer may request the return of the remainder of his deposit by submitting a written request to the inspection department. However, the developer shall continue to maintain temporary erosion control devices on those remaining lots for which building permits have not been issued and for any other areas upon which permanent erosion control has not been established. The balance of the deposit remaining in an account after deductions for all violations have been made shall be refunded within thirty days of receipt of the written request for refund along with a list of all deductions made from his deposit account. The responsible party shall have the right of appeal as set forth in this chapter. 
vi.  Erosion Control Deposits. Erosion control deposits posted pursuant to the requirements of this chapter shall not accrue interest. 
b.  Land Disturbance Associated with Construction on a Single Residential Lot. When land disturbing activities are conducted on a residential lot for which a building permit must be issued, the responsible party shall comply with the following: 
i.  Erosion Control Plan. Prior to approval of a building permit for a residential lot by the city, the builder/contractor or other responsible party obtaining the building permit shall submit an erosion control plan for approval by the city. No inspection may be performed on a project until a city-approved erosion control plan is implemented. 
ii.  Stop Work Order/Citation. The city shall inspect the erosion control devices located at a site for compliance with the approved erosion control plan submitted for such site. If a responsible party fails to implement or maintain erosion control devices as specified in the approved erosion control plan, the city shall provide such party with written notice of noncompliance identifying the nature of such noncompliance. The responsible party shall have twenty-four hours to bring the erosion control devices into compliance with the intent of the approved erosion control plan for the site where the violation occurred. Modifications to the approved erosion control plan may be required to maintain all sediment on-site. Correction shall include sediment clean-up, erosion control device repair, erosion control device maintenance, and/or installation of additional erosion control devices to prevent re-occurrence of the violation. The twenty-four hour cure period may be extended for inclement weather or other factors at the discretion of the building official. If the intent of the approved control plan (maintaining sediment on-site) is not met, then the responsible party shall take action within twenty-four hours to control soil eroding from the site and clean up any sediment and shall have one week to submit a new erosion control plan. Work may continue during the review period. Implementation of this plan will be required within twenty-four hours of plan approval by the building official. If no plan is submitted within one week, then construction activities shall be halted until a new plan is submitted and approved. At the end of the twenty-four hour cure period, the city shall re-inspect the site and may assess a re-inspection fee. If at the time of such re-inspection, the erosion control devices at the site have not been brought into compliance with the approved erosion control plan, the city may issue a stop work order and issue a citation for each violation of the city's erosion control requirements. When a stop work order has been issued, a re-inspection fee shall be assessed. To obtain a re-inspection for removal of the stop work order, a request must be submitted and a re-inspection fee, as set by the city council, shall be paid. 
D.  Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan Requirements. 
1.  Storm water pollution prevention plans shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the "Storm Water Quality Best Management Practices for Construction Activities," North Central Texas, latest edition, as published by the North Central Texas Council of Governments. Each erosion control plan required by this chapter shall clearly identify all erosion and sediment control measures to be installed and maintained throughout the duration of the project for which that plan is submitted. The plan shall include a sediment reduction rating of 0.70. Cut and fill slopes shall be no greater than 2:1, except as approved by city of Benbrook to meet other community or environmental objectives. The responsible party shall install and maintain erosion control devices in accordance with his city-approved erosion control plan as required by this chapter. 
2.  Modifications to the plan may be authorized by the city of Benbrook by written authorization to the permittee, and may include: 
a.  Major amendments of the erosion and sediment control plan submitted to the city of Benbrook, and/or 
b.  Field modifications of a minor nature. 
3.  Off-Site Borrow, Spoil and Staging Areas. Where applicable, off-site borrow areas, spoil areas and construction staging areas shall be considered as part of the project site and shall be governed by this chapter. 
4.  Related Land Areas. The erosion control requirements of this chapter shall apply to all related land areas. Additionally, when land disturbing activity occurs on a project, all disturbed land areas related to the project shall have permanent erosion control established before final occupancy of structures located thereon or final acceptance of the subdivision may be obtained. This section applies whether or not a building permit is required. 
5.  Below ground installations. All discharges resulting from below ground installations shall be passed through city-approved erosion control devices or removed from the site for proper disposal. 
6.  Erosion Control Plan Implementation and Compliance. Each responsible party shall implement and maintain the erosion control measures shown on its approved erosion control plan in order to minimize the erosion and the transport of silt, earth, topsoil, etc., by water runoff or construction activities, beyond the limits of the responsible party's site onto city streets, drainage easements, drainage facilities, storm drains or other city property prior to beginning any land disturbing activity. 
7.  General Guidelines for Erosion Control Plans and Implementation. 
a.  Maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize soil loss. 
b.  Natural vegetation should be retained wherever possible. 
c.  Where inadequate natural vegetation exists, or where it becomes necessary to remove existing natural vegetation, temporary controls should be installed promptly to minimize soil loss and ensure that erosion and sedimentation does not occur. 
d.  Clearing, except that necessary to establish sediment control devices, shall not begin until all sediment control devices have been installed and have been stabilized. 
e.  Wherever possible during construction, erosion controls shad be used on hillsides to slow drainage flow rate. 
f.  Erosion control elements should be implemented as soon as practical in the development process. 
g.  Waste or disposal areas and construction roads should be located and constructed in a manner that will minimize the amount of sediment entering streams. 
h.  Frequent fording of live streams will not be permitted; therefore, temporary bridges or other structures shall be used wherever an appreciable number of stream crossings are necessary. 
i.  When work areas or material sources are located in or adjacent to live streams, such areas shall be separated from the stream by a dike or other barrier to keep sediment from entering a flowing stream. Care shall be taken during the construction and removal of such barriers to minimize the sediment transport into a stream. 
j.  Should preventative measures fail to function effectively, the applicant shall act immediately to bring the erosion and/or siltation under control by whatever additional means are necessary. 
k.  Erosion control devices shall be placed to trap any losses from stockpiled topsoil. 
l.  The selection and timing of the installation of erosion controls shall be based upon weather and seasonal conditions that could make certain controls not practicable. 
m.  Vegetation used for vegetative cover shall be suitable for local soil and weather conditions. Ground cover plants shall comply with listings from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service for North Central Texas. 
n.  Runoff shall be diverted away from construction areas as much as possible. 
o.  Stripping of vegetation from project sites shall be phased so as to expose the minimum amount of area to soil erosion for the shortest possible period of time. Phasing shall also consider the varying requirements of an erosion control plan at different stages of construction. Phasing shall be required on all sites disturbing greater than thirty acres, with the size of each phase to be established at plan review and as approved by the city of Benbrook. 
p.  Developers, builders, or owners of property shall install all utilities, including franchise utilities, before final acceptance of a subdivision, property and/or structure. Final acceptance will also be contingent upon having all necessary erosion control measures installed to minimize off-site sediment. A site may be accepted without erosion control measures if perennial vegetative cover is actively growing at the discretion of the city engineer. 
8.  Erosion control requirements shall include the following: 
a.  Stabilization Requirements: Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within fourteen days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
i.  Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over ninety percent of the seeded area. 
ii.  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
iii.  Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of seventy-five percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum seventy-five percent survival for one year is achieved. 
b.  Special techniques that meet the design criteria outlined in "Storm Water Quality Best Management Practices for Construction Activities," published by the North Central Texas Council of Governments on steep slopes or in drainage ways shall be used to ensure stabilization. 
c.  Soil stockpiles must be stabilized or covered at the end of each workday. 
d.  The entire site must be stabilized, using a heavy mulch layer or another method that does not require germination to control erosion, at the close of the construction season. 
e.  Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or sediment from the site. 
f.  Techniques that divert upland runoff past disturbed slopes shall be employed. 
9.  Sediment control requirements shall include: 
a.  Settling basins, sediment traps, or tanks and perimeter controls. 
b.  Settling basins that are designed in a manner that allows adaptation to provide long term storm water management, if required by the city of Benbrook. 
c.  Protection for adjacent properties by the use of a vegetated buffer strip in combination with perimeter controls. 
10.  Waterway and watercourse protection requirements shall include: 
a.  A temporary stream crossing installed and approved by the city of Benbrook if a wet watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction. 
b.  Stabilization of the watercourse channel before, during, and after any in-channel work. 
c.  Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion located at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels. 
11.  Construction site access requirements shall include: 
a.  A temporary access road provided at all sites. 
b.  Other measures required by the city of Benbrook in order to ensure that sediment is not tracked onto public streets by construction vehicles or washed into storm drains. 
12.  Erosion Hazard Setbacks. Erosion hazard setback determinations will be made for every stream in which natural channels are to be preserved. Natural channel banks will be protected by use of the determined setbacks unless a plan to stabilize and protect stream banks is approved by the assistant city manager. 
E.  Franchised Utility Companies. Subject to the terms of its franchise agreement with the city, including but not limited to terms regarding permits, a franchised utility company engaging in land disturbing activities within the city of Benbrook shall comply with the following: 
1.  Erosion Control Plan. Prior to beginning any land disturbing activity or upon the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, an erosion control plan shall be submitted for approval by the city. 
2.  Stop Work Order/Citation. The city shall inspect the erosion control devices located at a site for compliance with the approved erosion control plan submitted for such site. If a responsible party fails to implement or maintain erosion control devices as specified in his approved erosion control plan, the city shall provide such party with written notice of noncompliance identifying the nature of such noncompliance. The responsible party shall have twenty-four hours to bring his erosion control devices into compliance with the approved erosion control plan for the site where the violation occurred. Correction shall include sediment clean-up, erosion control device repair, and erosion control device maintenance. The twenty-four hour cure period may be extended for inclement weather or other factors at the discretion of the inspector. 
    At the end of the twenty-four hour cure period, the city shall re-inspect the site. If at the time of such re-inspection, the erosion control devices at the site have not been brought into compliance with the approved erosion control plan, the city may issue a stop work order and issue a citation for each violation of the city's erosion control requirements. To obtain a re-inspection for removal of the stop work order, a request for re-inspection must be submitted. 
F.  Removal of Erosion Control Devices. Upon final occupancy or upon establishing permanent ground cover on a lot, all temporary erosion control devices shall be removed.

15.42.050 - Runoff from industrial activity. 
A.  Applicability. The operator of any facility required to obtain a permit to discharge storm water by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission shall be responsible for obtaining such permits. Except as provided herein, responsibility for inspection and enforcement of said permits remains with the state and/or federal agencies delegated with such authority. 
B.  Unpermitted Discharges Prohibited. A person who is the operator of a facility commits an offense if the person discharges, or causes to be discharged, storm water associated with industrial activity without first having obtained a NPDES or TPDES permit to do so. 
C.  Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
D.  Submission of NOI to City. The operator of a facility, including construction sites, required to have a NPDES or TPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity shall submit a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) to the assistant city manager at the same time the operator submits the original notice of intent to the EPA or the TNRCC as applicable. 
    The copy of the notice of intent may be delivered to the assistant city manager either in person or by mailing it to: 
Notice of Intent to Discharge Storm Water 
Inspections Department 
City of Benbrook 
P.O. Box 26569 
Benbrook, Texas 76126 
E.  Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city of Benbrook within three business days of the phone notice.

Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(Ord. 1124 § 1 (part), 2002) 
15.42.060 - Runoff from developed property. 
A.  Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision, development site plan or building permit applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city of Benbrook under the specifications of this ordinance. The chapter also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans must also be reviewed by local environmental protection officials to ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans. 
B.  Review and Approval Procedures. No land owner or land operator shall receive approval of a final plat, development site plan, or building plot plan for any of the building, grading or other land development permits required for land disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements of this chapter prior to commencing the proposed activity. 
    As part of the final plat application, development site plan application, or building permit application, the applicant shall provide a plan for the control of post-development runoff pollutant control as part of the application process. Applications for post-development control plans shall be submitted at the same time as the overall development application with which it is associated. If the permit application, storm water management plan or maintenance agreement are disapproved, the applicant may revise the storm water management plan or agreement. 
C.  Requirements for Post-Development Storm Water Management Plan Approval. 
1.  Storm Water Management Plan Required for All Developments. No application for development will be approved unless it includes a storm water management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be prepared by a registered professional engineer and must indicate whether storm water will be managed on-site or off-site and, if on-site, the general location and type of practices. 
2.  Storm Water Management Plan Requirements. A storm water management plan shall be required with all permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing storm water generated at the project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of storm water management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of storm water runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the following information shall be included in the storm water management plan: 
a.  Contact Information. The name, address, and telephone number of all persons having a legal interest in the property and the legal description of the property or properties affected. 
b.  Topographic Base Map. A topographic base map of the site which extends a minimum of five hundred feet beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicates existing surface water drainage including streams, ponds, culverts, ditches, and wetlands; current land use including all existing structures; and significant natural and manmade features not otherwise shown, the location of existing and proposed buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, structural storm water management and sediment control facilities. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities, roads and easements; the limits of clearing and grading. A written description of the site plan and justification of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required. 
c.  Calculations. Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the pre-development and post-development conditions for the design storms specified in this ordinance. Such calculations shall include (i) description of the design storm frequency, intensity and duration, (ii) time of concentration, (iii) soil curve numbers or runoff coefficients, (iv) peak runoff rates and total runoff volumes for each watershed area, (v) infiltration rates, where applicable, (vi) culvert capacities, (vii) flow velocities, (viii) data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff for the design storms referenced in Section 16.28.035.C of the Benbrook Municipal Code, as amended, and (ix) documentation of sources for all computation methods and field test results. 
d.  Soils Information. If a storm water management control measure depends on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles. The number and location of required soil borings or soil sits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the control measure. A written or graphic inventory of the natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project and a description of the watershed and its relation to the project site. This description should include a discussion of soil conditions, topography, wetlands, and other native vegetative areas on the site. Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for development. 
e.  Maintenance and Repair Plan. The design and planning of all storm water management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued function. These plans will identify the parts or components of a storm water management facility that need to be maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary. Provisions for the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan. 
    The city of Benbrook may also require a post-development storm water management plan to consider the maximum development potential of a site under existing zoning, regardless of whether the applicant presently intends to develop the site to its maximum potential. 
    For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed site, an applicant shall include within the storm water concept plan measures for controlling existing storm water runoff discharges from the site in accordance with the standards of this chapter to the maximum extent practicable. 
C.  Waivers to Storm Water Management Requirements. Every applicant shall provide for post-development storm water management as required by this ordinance, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the storm water management plan requirements shall be submitted to the city of Benbrook for approval. 
    The minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies: 
1.  It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter. 
2.  Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that has been approved by the city of Benbrook and the implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance. 
3.  Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the storm water system. 
4.  The city of Benbrook finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
5.  Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce: (a) the generation of storm water from the site, (b) the size and cost of storm water storage, and (c) the pollutants generated at the site. 
    In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the city of Benbrook may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these storm water management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city of Benbrook that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
    Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
    Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
    Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; 
    Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property. 
D.  General Performance Criteria for Post-Development Storm Water Management. Unless judged by the city of Benbrook to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites: 
1.  All site designs shall establish storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of storm water as required in Section 16.28.035.C of the Benbrook Municipal Code, as amended. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. All storm water BMPs shall be designed in a manner to minimize the need for maintenance and reduce the chances of failure. 
2.  For new development, structural storm water treatment practices shall be designed to remove eighty percent of the average annual post development total suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a STP complies with this performance standard if it is: 
 sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQ v ) (i.e. a 25-year storm, designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in "Storm Water Quality Best Management Practices for Residential and Commercial Land Uses," latest edition, published by the North Central Texas Council of Governments, constructed properly, and maintained regularly. 
3.  Storm water discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices. 
4.  Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the city of Benbrook to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design requirements. 
5.  Maintenance Agreements. All storm water treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the storm water treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the storm water treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all storm water treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance activities. 
6.  Nonstructural Storm Water Practices. The use of nonstructural storm water treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. These non-structural practices are explained in detail in "Storm Water Quality Best Management Practices for Residential and Commercial Land Uses," latest edition, published by the North Central Texas Council of Governments. Applicants wishing to use of nonstructural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners. 
E.  As Built Plans. All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any storm water management practices located on-site after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all storm water management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer.

15.42.070 - Maintenance and repair of storm water facilities. 
A.  Inspection and Maintenance Associated with Construction Runoff BMPs. The operator of a construction site shall maintain the required erosion and sediment control devices in a clean and operational state. The operator shall inspect each erosion and sediment control device after each rainfall event that exceeds one-half inch in twenty-four hours, or every fourteen calendar days, whichever occurs first. The operator shall repair, replace, or remove sediment as necessary. 
    The operator shall also comply with any maintenance or repair directive given by the city's inspector. Failure to comply with a city directive may result in deductions from the erosion control deposit account or stop work orders as provided in Section 15.42.040, or in citations as provided in Section 15.42.080. 
B.  Maintenance of BMPs Associated with Post-Development Storm Water Management. 
1.  Routine Maintenance. All storm water BMPs shall be maintained in a clean and operational state, according to the measures outlined in the approved storm water management plan. The person(s) or organization(s) responsible for maintenance shall be designated in the plan, including the property owner or homeowner's association. 
    Maintenance agreements shall specify responsibilities for financing maintenance. 
2.  Nonroutine Maintenance. Nonroutine maintenance includes maintenance activities that are expensive but infrequent, such as pond dredging or major repairs to storm water structures. Nonroutine maintenance shall be performed on an as-needed basis based on information gathered during regular inspections or directives by the city inspector. 
    If nonroutine maintenance activities are not completed in a timely manner or as specified in the approved plan, the city may complete the necessary maintenance at the owner's/operator's expense. 
3.  Inspections. The person(s) or organization(s) responsible for maintenance shall inspect storm water BMPs on a regular basis as outlined in the plan. Authorized representatives of the city may enter at reasonable times to conduct on-site inspections. 
    For BMPs maintained by the property owner or homeowner's association, inspection and maintenance reports shall be filed with the city as provided for in the plan. 
C.  Records of Installation and Maintenance Activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a storm water management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least two years. These records shall be made available to the city during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
D.  Failure to Maintain Practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the storm water management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the storm water management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have ten days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the city may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property. 
E.  Maintenance Agreements. 
1.  Maintenance Easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a post-development storm water management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the storm water management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this ordinance. The easement agreement shall be recorded by the city in the Tarrant County plat records. 
2.  Maintenance Covenants. Long term maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the city and recorded into the land record prior to final plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the storm water management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. 
    All storm water management facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this ordinance and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the city, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the storm water management facility. 
3.  Performance Bond/Security. The city may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond prior to issuance of a permit in order to insure that the storm water practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved storm water management plan. The amount of the installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the storm water management practices approved under the permit. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the storm water management plan. 
    The installation performance security shall be released in full only upon submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a registered professional engineer that the storm water practice has been installed in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this ordinance. The city will make a final inspection of the storm water practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1124 § 1 (part), 2002) 
15.42.080 - Administration and enforcement.

2.  Inspections. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to, routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES storm water permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other storm water treatment practices. 
    Regular inspections of the storm water management system construction and operation shall be conducted by the staff of the city. All inspections shall be documented and written reports prepared that contain the following information: 
 The date and location of the inspection; 
 Whether construction is in compliance with the approved storm water management plan; 
 Variations from the approved construction specifications; 
 Any violations that exist. 
    If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by the city. 
3.  Right-of-Entry for Inspection. When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the city of Benbrook the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this chapter is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this chapter. 
B.  Owner's Responsibilities. It is the owner's responsibility to take the necessary steps to comply with the requirements of this chapter.

g.  Allowing pollutants, including but not limited to yard waste, to be introduced into the MS4. 
2.  Proceeding Without Applicable Permits. Any developer, owner or builder who fails to obtain a development permit before beginning construction is in violation of this chapter. In addition to the penalties outlined in Section 15.42.080(C), no building permit, plat, site plan, certificate of occupancy or other use permit shall be issued for any construction, reconstruction or development upon any land where such construction, reconstruction or development is not in conformity with the requirements and intent of this chapter. Anyone who violates any of the terms and provisions of this chapter shall be denied the use permit until the violation is corrected. 
    Any development activity that is commenced or is conducted contrary to this chapter may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.

4.  Stop Work Orders. Persons receiving a notice of violation will be required to halt all construction activities. This "stop work order" will be in effect until the city of Benbrook confirms that the development activity is in compliance, and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of violation in a timely manner can result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this chapter. 
5.  Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any provisions of this chapter shall be fined not more than two thousand dollars for all violations involving zoning, fire safety or public health and sanitation, including dumping of refuse, and shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars for all other violations of this chapter. Each day that a violation is permitted shall constitute a separate offense. 
6.  Restoration of Lands. Any violator may be required to restore land to its undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, the city of Benbrook may take necessary corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until paid. 
7.  Holds on Occupancy Permits. Occupancy permits will not be granted until corrections to all storm water practices have been made and accepted by the city of Benbrook. 
8.  Nuisances. 
a.  An actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 that violates or would violate this chapter is hereby declared to be a nuisance. 
b.  Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall institute and complete all actions necessary to remedy the effects of such nuisance.

2.  Variances. Variances for any type of permit or storm sewer facilities shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard, drainage problems and soil loss. The variance shall be issued only upon meeting all three of the criteria listed below: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, including an exceptional hardship created by the applicability of the effective date to the application for a permit; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws. 
    In considering variance requests, the planning and zoning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter. 
    Upon consideration of the relevant factors and the purposes of this chapter, the planning and zoning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(Ord. 1203 § 1 (part), 2006) 
16.04.045 - Parkland dedication required. 
A.  Purpose. 
1.  This section is adopted to provide recreational areas in accordance with the park and recreation facilities element of the Benbrook comprehensive plan in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of development in the city of Benbrook. It is declared by the city council that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks are necessary and in the public welfare, and that the only adequate procedure to provide the same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property for subdivisions in the city. 
2.  Neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby. The park areas established by the city council and shown on master plan for the city shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from any residence located therein. The primary cost of neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. Therefore, the following requirements are adopted to achieve the purposes stated. 
B.  General Requirements. These requirements shall apply to land zoned residential which is to be used for single-family, duplex and/or apartment residential purposes. 
1.  Whenever a final plat is filed on record with the county clerk of Tarrant County for development of a residential area in accordance with the planning and zoning ordinances of the city, such plat shall dedicate an area of land for park purposes, which area shall equal one acre for each one hundred proposed dwelling units. Fee simple title to the parkland shall be conveyed to the city by general warranty deed. Any proposed plat submitted to the city for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated. The required dedication may be met by a payment of money in lieu of land when permitted or required by the other provisions of this section. 
2.  The city council declares that development of an area smaller than two acres for public park purposes is impractical. Therefore, if fewer than two hundred units are proposed by a plat filed for approval, the developer shall be required to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount unless the dedication will increase the size of an existing park. 
3.  In instances where an area of more than two acres are required to be dedicated, the city council shall have the right to accept the dedication for approval on the final plat, or to refuse same, after consideration of the recommendation of the park and recreation board and planning and zoning commission, and to require payment of cash in lieu of land, if the city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain in the area of the proposed development, or if the recreation potential for that zone would be better served by expanding or improving parks. 
4.  The dedication required by this section shall be made by filing of the final plat or contemporaneously by separate instrument unless additional dedication is required subsequent to the filing of the final plat. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceed the figure upon which the original dedication was based, such additional dedication shall be required, and shall be made by payment of the cash in lieu of land or by the conveyance of an entire number lot to the city. 
C.  Money in Lieu of Land Dedication. Subject to approval of the planning and zoning commission, a landowner responsible for dedication under this section may elect to meet the requirements of subsection B of this section, in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land made at the time of final plat recording or as stated in the developer's agreement. The dedication requirement shall be met by a payment in lieu of land at a per dwelling unit price set from time to time by resolution by the city council, sufficient to acquire land and provide for adjacent streets, utilities and park improvements. The fee assessed per dwelling unit shall be in accordance with Chapter 1.12 of this code. Cash payments may be used only for acquisition or improvement of a park located within the city. The fee shall be evaluated periodically based on current land values. 
D.  Park Master Plan Considerations. Land shown on the city's comprehensive plan as being suitable for development by the city for a major recreational center, school site, park, or other public use, shall be reserved for a period of one year after the preliminary plat is approved by the city. A failure by the city council to notify the subdivider of its interest in acquiring the land within the one-year period shall constitute a waiver of the right to reserve the land. Any waiver of the right to reserve the land shall no longer be effective if the preliminary plat expires without adoption of a final plat. 
E.  Special Fund, Right to Refund. 
1.  There is established a special fund for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this section or any preceding ordinance, which fund shall be known as the Park Land Dedication Fund. 
2.  The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this section with reference to the individual plats involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within ten years from the date received by the city for acquisition or development of a neighborhood park as defined herein. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended, the owners of the property on the first day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of such sum, computed on a per dwelling unit basis. The owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be barred. 
F.  Additional Requirements, Definitions for Neighborhood Parks. 
1.  Any land dedicated to the city under this section must be suitable for park and recreation uses. The following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable (unless recommended in the comprehensive plan): 
a.  Any area primarily located in the one hundred year-floodplain; 
b.  Any areas of unusual topography or slope which renders same unusable for recreational activities. 
    The above characteristics of a parkland dedication area may be grounds for refusal of any preliminary or final plat. 
2.  Drainage areas may be accepted as a part of a neighborhood park if the entire floodplain width is dedicated to the city and if no significant area of the park is cut off from access by such channel. If land is dedicated which is in the floodway fringe but not including the floodway, then it shall count as one-half of the requirement as set forth in subsection (B)(1) of this section. 
3.  Each park shall have ready access to an improved public street. 
4.  Unless provided otherwise in this chapter, an action by the city shall be by the city's planning and zoning commission. 
5.  All parkland dedication shall be consistent with the standards as set forth in the comprehensive plan. 
G.  Credit for Private Parks. If a developer desires to incorporate private park, recreation or open space areas or amenities within their development, they may request limited credit for these facilities against their public open space requirements. A developer may request credit for any private park, recreation or open space area, but such private park, recreation or open space amenities may never satisfy more than fifty percent of the total park and open space dedication requirement of this chapter. 
H.  Appeals. Decisions of the city planner in the implementation of this policy may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission, and decisions of the planning and zoning commission may be appealed to the city council. The standard for review of decisions shall be whether the decision rendered was clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious and therefore constituted a clear abuse of discretion.

Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit maintenance of existing service except where, in the determination of the director of community development, a public health and safety hazard exists. 
F.  Any land which, in its natural state, is subject to a one hundred-year flood or which cannot be properly drained shall not be subdivided, resubdivided, or developed until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the planning and zoning commission that the construction of specific improvements proposed by the developer can be expected to yield a usable building site. 
G.  No building permit, certificate of occupancy or "power-on" approval shall be granted for any building occupied by a single business that crosses a lot or property line, until the property is replatted into a single lot. 
H.

16.04.055 - Acceptance of dedication.

Withdrawal of any such dedication shall void any previous approval of the plat. Approval of a plat by the planning and zoning commission shall not be deemed an acceptance of any proposed dedication and shall not impose any duty on the city concerning the improvements or maintenance of such dedication until the developer has actually improved same and the city has accepted and made use thereof. 
A.  For any subdivision for which a plat has been filed for record, or where land has been divided by metes and bounds and no plat filed for record, and which has not been approved according to these regulations, or which fails to meet the standards contained or referred to in this chapter, the commission shall adopt a resolution concerning such failures or lack of approval and indicating that same is in violation of the provisions of this chapter. The commission shall cause a copy of such resolution, signed by the chairman of the commission and attested to and notarized by the city secretary or designee, to be filed in the Deed Records of Tarrant County. 
B.  If compliance and approval are secured following the filing of such resolution, the commission shall file in the Deed Records of Tarrant County an instrument that, in effect, rescinds such earlier filed resolution. 
C.  Disapproval of a plat by the commission shall be deemed a refusal by the city to accept the offered dedications shown thereon. Approval of a plat shall not impose any duty upon the city concerning the maintenance or improvement of any such dedicated parts until the proper authorities of the city have actually appropriated the same by entry, use, or improvement. Any such dedication, before or after actual appropriation may be vacated by the council in any manner provided by law.

2.  A change in a plat that does not fall within any of the categories as an amending plan under Section 16.16.025(C) and does not meet the conditions for vacation of a plat, is a replat and may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding plat only if the replat: 
a.  Is signed and acknowledged by the owners of the property being replatted; 
b.  Is approved by the commission after a public hearing on the matter at which parties in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard; and 
c.  Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions. 
3.  If during the preceding five years, any of the area to be replatted was limited by an interim or permanent zoning classification, to a residential use for not more than two residential units per lot; or any lot in the preceding plat was limited by deed restrictions to a residential use for not more than two residential units per lot, the notice and voting requirements of Section 212.015, Local Government Code, are applicable and must be followed.

16.16.015 - Procedure summary. 
    Any owner or developer of any lot, tract, or parcel of land located within the corporate limits of the city or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction who may wish to effect a subdivision of such land shall conform to the general procedure described as follows: 
A.  Application Procedures. 
1.  Written Request Required. Every proposal submitted for commission action shall be made in writing on application forms provided by the city, and shall be accompanied by all prescribed fees, and shall be complete in all respects before being accepted for filing. 
2.  Filing Deadline. Every proposal shall be filed with the city planner not later than noon the Wednesday thirty days prior to the regular meeting date of the commission. When the filing deadline falls on a city holiday, the following workday shall be observed as the filing deadline. Failure to submit a complete application on time will result in the rejection of the application unless undo hardship can be demonstrated. 
3.  Notice. Public notice of proposals to amend the boundaries of zoning districts or preliminary plats or residential replats as defined in Section 212.015 of the Local Government Code shall be sent, at the minimum, to the applicant and/or his agent and to the owners of all properties laying within two hundred feet of the property in question, as said ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll. Notice shall be given in writing deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, not less than fifteen days prior to the date of commission hearing. The notice of the hearing shall advise that a specific proposal has been submitted, shall state the date, time and place of hearing, shall state that further information may be obtained relative to the proposal at the office of the city planner. 
4.  Submission of Supporting Information. Information supporting a recommendation to approve or disapprove any proposal before the commission shall be submitted only through the city planner or to the commission in a public meeting. 
5.  Withdrawal of Proposal. When any applicant desires to withdraw any proposal, they may do so by filing a written request to that effect with the city planner. Such request shall not be effective unless and until approval of the withdrawal by the commission at the public meeting. 
B.  Preliminary Conference and Sketch Plat Review. 
1.  Preliminary Conference. Prior to the official filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider should consult with and present a proposed plan (sketch plat) of subdivision to the city planner for comments and advice of the procedures, specifications, and standards required by the city for the subdivision of land. 
2.  Sketch Plat Review. Sketch plat review will normally be accomplished by submission of the sketch plat material as described in Section 16.16.020(A) and a conference with the city planner. The city planner will provide comments identifying compliance or noncompliance with applicable ordinances and standards, elements of the comprehensive plan, and suggestions for improvement in design to either comply with the applicable ordinances and standards or to improve circulation, drainage, or compatibility with adjacent neighborhoods. The applicant should make every effort to comply with the suggested changes or to respond in writing to the city planner as to why the changes will not be made. These suggestions and responses will be made a part of the staff report on any future plat submittal where the discrepancy remains. Waivers from these requirements will require a waiver under the terms of Section 16.24.020. Conflicts with the comprehensive plan shall be resolved by requesting an amendment to the comprehensive plan before proceeding with the plat. Appeals on suggested design changes will remain the discretion of the planning and zoning commission. Approval of the sketch plat does not constitute acceptance of the subdivision, but is merely a review procedure prior to submittal of the formal preliminary plat. 
C.  Preliminary Plat. The subdivider shall prepare and submit to the city planning and zoning commission a preliminary plat of a standard plat for its consideration and approval. 
D.  Final Plat. Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission, the subdivider may then prepare a final plat of all of the land included in the preliminary plat, or all of the phases when such phases were approved on the preliminary plat, for submission to and approval by the staff. The final plat shall be accompanied by required engineering plans. 
E.  Review of Engineering Plans for Public Improvements. Concurrent with the review of the final plat, the city planner and city engineer shall review the engineering plans and specifications for all required public improvements for conformance with the city standards. The final plat application shall be considered incomplete, and processing suspended, until the engineering plans and financial assurance instruments are approved and accepted. 
F.  Upon acceptance of such plat and public properties by the planning and zoning commission, the city planner or designee shall cause such plat to be recorded in the Plat Records of Tarrant County, Texas. 
    A flow chart indicating the sequence of the steps involved in obtaining approval for subdivision is shown on the following pages.

ff.  The following full statement of restrictions shall be placed in the dedication instrument of any subdivision plat that contains land designated as part of a one hundred-year floodplain by FEMA: 
Floodplain Restriction 
No construction shall be allowed within a floodplain easement unless specifically approved by the City of Benbrook. Where construction is permitted, all finished floor elevations shall be a minimum of two (2) foot above the base flood elevation (100-year flood or one percent probability flood elevation.) 
Any existing creeks, lakes, reservoirs, or drainage channels traversing along or across portions of this addition, will remain as an open channel at all times and will be maintained by the individual owners of the lot or lots that are traversed by or adjacent to the drainage courses along or across said lots. The City of Benbrook will not be responsible for the maintenance and operation of said drainage ways or for the control of erosion. Each property owner shall keep the natural drainage channels traversing adjacent to his property clean and free of debris, silt, or any substance which would result in unsanitary conditions and the City shall have the right of ingress and egress for the purpose of inspection and supervision of maintenance work by the property owner to alleviate any undesirable conditions which may occur. The natural drainage channel, as in the case of all natural drainage channels, is subject to storm water overflow and natural bank erosion to an extent that cannot be definitely defined. The City of Benbrook shall not be liable for damages of any nature resulting from the occurrence of these natural phenomena, nor resulting from a failure of any structures within the natural drainage channels. The natural drainage channel crossing each lot is shown by the floodplain easement line as shown on the plat. 
gg.  Except for residential replats of less than six lots or two acres, whichever is less, Texas State Plane Coordinates shall be provided for at least two corners of the plat must be shown on the face of the plat. The reference monuments and method of determining the coordinates (such as triangulation of city monuments or global positioning system techniques) shall be provided; 
hh.  All distances shown on the final plat shall be horizontal ground lengths. The plat shall state the Texas State Plane Coordinate System combined scale factor that is to be used to convert ground lengths to grid lengths. 
ii.  A notation shall be placed on the final plat referencing the tree preservation and mitigation plan on file with the city planning department. 
4.  When submitted, the final plat shall be accompanied by the construction plans for public improvements, as described in Section 16.20.020 of this code and the final iSWM TM site plan. Formal acceptance of the final plat for processing will not occur until approval of the site improvement engineering data is accepted by the city. 
D.  Processing of Final Plat. Processing of final plats shall be in accordance with this section, all other development regulations, and all applicable state and federal regulations. 
1.  No final plat or replat shall be approved unless it is in compliance with the comprehensive plan. 
2.  No final plat or final replat will not be accepted for processing if all or any portion of the land area encompassed within the plat is included in or directly affected by any proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan, which has been set for formal presentation to the planning and zoning commission or the city council by placement on a formal agenda. 
3.  A final plat or replat shall not be accepted for processing until all necessary application materials have been submitted and approved by the city. No final plat will be accepted for processing until the developer's agreements with the city are executed, all public improvements plans, specifications and cost estimates have been approved by the city planner, and financial assurance has been provided. Any final plat submitted will be conditionally disapproved until such materials have been accepted. 
E.  Final Plat Approval. The commission, acting through its chair, shall act on a formally accepted final plat within thirty days of the date of acceptance of the final plat for processing. In the case of a short form plat, the commission as a whole shall act on a final plat. If such plat is not approved, conditionally disapproved or disapproved within thirty days from the date of acceptance, it shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate, showing such acceptance date and the failure to take action thereon within thirty days from such acceptance date, shall on demand be issued by the commission and such certificate shall be in lieu of the endorsement in this chapter required. Final plats meeting all conditions set on the preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission shall be approved by the city staff. If a final plat contains significant deviation from the approved preliminary plat, planning and zoning commission approval shall be required. The decision of the commission shall be either approval, conditional disapproval, or disapproval of the final plat. 
1.  A final plat which meets all applicable requirements of the subdivision ordinance and any conditions of preliminary plat approval shall be approved by the commission by placing thereon the signature of the chair of the commission and the attestation of the city secretary. Approved final plats and supporting instruments shall be retained by the city planner for recording as hereinafter specified. 
2.  Conditional disapproval shall constitute lack of approval of a final plat subject to conformity with prescribed conditions, but shall constitute approval when such conditions are met and approved by the city planner. 
3.  Disapproval signifies rejection in toto of the final plat as submitted. The commission, following final plat disapproval, may permit an applicant to then submit another final plat or reinstate the subdivision approval procedure at another step. 
4.  Conditionally disapproved final plats showing satisfaction of the conditions, in as many copies as required by the commission, may be submitted at any time for approval. 
F.  Upon approval of the final plat, the applicant shall submit two blackline mylars and two blueline or blackline copies of the plat with original seals and signatures and two original signed dedication instruments, tax certificates, groundwater availability certificate (if required), suitable for filing with the county along with recording fees required by the county clerk.

* The minimum percentage required to be preserved may be met in a single quality tree stand. 
H.  Mitigation. If preservation cannot be reasonably achieved, then the following mitigation standards shall apply: 
1.  Protected trees may be removed, not to exceed the minimum tree preservation requirements for all lots as shown on Table 16-A1, if mitigated as required on Table 16-A2. 
2.  Protected trees may be removed in excess of the minimum preservation requirement as shown on Table 16-A1 provided the planning and zoning commission, in accordance with subsection L of this section, approve the excess removal. 
3.  Mitigation shall be calculated for the entire development, as applicable. Trees required for mitigation may be planted at the time of development or when an individual lot is developed. A note shall be placed on the face of the final plat referencing the tree preservation and mitigation plan on file with the city planning department and noting the calculations for preservation and mitigation for the entire development and for each phase and lot. A mitigation plan and an irrigation plan will be required with the application for each building permit. 
4.  Replacement trees shall be planted on the same property for which the tree mitigation is required. With the approval of the assistant city manager or designee, fifty percent of the trees required to be planted as mitigation may be planted off-site at city parks, the city tree farm, or other public areas. The city and the person seeking off-site mitigation approval may consult with an academic organization, state agency, or nonprofit organization to identify an area for which tree planting will best address the science-based benefits of trees and other reforestation needs of the city. 
5.  Mitigation is only required to be calculated for secondary trees equal to or greater than twelve-inches dbh. 
6.  Each replacement tree shall be a minimum of two-inch caliper and at least five feet in height when planted. 
7.  If trees are planted as mitigation under this section, the developer shall post a two-year maintenance surety bond or cash bond meeting the requirements under Section 16.24.010 of Chapter 16.24 for the cost to replace the trees. Upon completion of the two-year landscape establishment period for replacement trees, the city shall inspect the trees and determine whether ninety percent of the trees are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such a finding, the city shall release the currency or bond. In the absence of such a finding, the applicant shall be notified to replace any unhealthy or dead trees. If the applicant does not take remedial steps to bring the property into compliance, the city shall make demand for payment on the cash bond, surety bond, or letter of credit. The city may use all legal remedies to enforce this chapter in addition to making demand on the security provided herein. 
I.  Payment in lieu of mitigation. 
1.  A land owner/developer responsible for tree mitigation under this section may elect to meet the requirements, in whole or in part, by a cash payment in lieu of tree replacement. The payment shall be on a caliper inch unit cost as established by the city council in Chapter 1.12 of the Benbrook Municipal Code. Cash payment shall be deposited in the tree fund and be used to purchase and install landscaping (inclusive of trees, bushes, shrubs, mulch, soil, decorative rocks or stones, irrigation, and necessary hardscape) at city parks, city tree farm, or other public areas. 
a.  Payment in lieu of tree mitigation for greater than fifty percent of the required mitigation (greater than fifty percent of total dbh provided as mitigation) shall be subject to approval by the planning and zoning commission. 
b.  Payment in lieu of tree mitigation for less than or equal to fifty percent of mitigation requirement (less than or equal to fifty percent of total dbh provided as mitigation) may be approved by the assistant city manager or designee. 
2.  The applicant shall pay the fees for tree removal established by city council in Chapter 1.12 of the Benbrook Municipal Code. The fee shall be based on the fair market value of materials and labor at the time of planting and the reasonable estimated cost for maintenance and irrigation for a period of two years. 
3.  Fees contributed to the tree fund shall be paid prior to the issuance of a grading permit on all commercial, industrial, or multi-family residential developments, prior to final approval of a gas well drilling permit and prior to filing a final plat in the Tarrant County clerk's office for all single-family residential subdivisions.

4.  No heavy equipment shall be moved onto a site prior to all applicable permits being issued. 
5.  Trees less than six inches dbh may be removed without a permit. Site clearing may not be completed with heavy equipment under the drip line of protected tree(s)/protected tree stand(s) to be preserved that are protected in accordance with Section 16.28.010.E.9 of this Chapter. 
K.  Permit review and approval process. 
1.  A request for a tree removal permit shall be submitted and approved prior to the removal of any protected tree(s) in the city. Permits shall not be unreasonably withheld by the city. 
2.  A complete application shall be submitted along with the application fee, if required. The fees shall be established by the city council and published in Chapter 1.12 of the Benbrook Municipal Code. A complete application includes: 
a.  Tree inventory and tables. The applicant shall prepare and submit a drawing showing the location and species of each tree with a trunk six-inches or greater dbh. In areas of dense vegetation or a tree stand that are proposed to be undisturbed, an outline of the vegetation may be shown. A registered landscape architect, urban forester, botanist, arborist, or professional land surveyor that has documented completion of at least eight hours of training in Texas tree identification shall prepare the plan. Tables shall accompany the inventory to identify the tree by the number on the plan and list the tree species, tree designation, and size (dbh). Tree stands or dense vegetation shall be inventoried by the number on the plan and shall specify the area of the continuous drip line. The tree inventory plan shall be in substantial conformity with the plan submitted with the preliminary plat application. 
b.  Tree preservation and mitigation plan. The tree preservation and mitigation plan shall be submitted prior to, or along with the civil plans, grading permit, or building permit application.

In areas of dense vegetation that are proposed to be undisturbed, an outline of the vegetation may be shown. A registered landscape architect, urban forester, botanist, arborist, or professional land surveyor that has documented completion of at least eight hours of training in Texas tree identification shall prepare the plan. The tree survey shall be submitted prior to, or along with the preliminary plat application, grading permit, or building permit application. 
4.  Tree removal permits shall be valid for a period of one hundred eighty days. 
5.  Upon request of the applicant, the assistant city manager or designee shall be authorized to work with the owners, developers, and builders to make non-substantive changes, within the scope of this section, to plans, permits, and other requirements throughout the development and construction processes that will provide the greatest reasonable tree survival. The decision of the assistant city manager or designee may be appealed by the applicant to the planning and zoning commission.

4.  Alternative tree preservation/mitigation plan. 
M.  Enforcement. 
1.  The building official or designee of the city shall have the authority to place a stop work order on any activity involving the removal of protected tree(s)/protected tree stand(s), or that may otherwise endanger trees contrary to the provisions of this chapter. The building official or designee may deny all permits and certificates of occupancy for any site that does not comply with this chapter. 
2.  A person may be held criminally responsible for a violation of this chapter if the person intentionally removes, assists in the removal or causes the removal of protected tree(s)/protected tree stand(s) without complying with the requirements of this chapter or owns part or all of the land where the violation occurs. 
3.  Each tree removed in violation of this chapter shall constitute a distinct and separate offense. 
4.  Each tree preserved or planted under this chapter that is removed, destroyed or dies within two years of approval shall constitute a distinct and separate offense. 
5.  It shall be an affirmative defense that trees are injured or destroyed by natural causes, natural disasters, including but not limited to tornadoes, straight-line winds, ice storms, fire, floods, hail, or lightning strikes, or through the independent unauthorized actions of third parties. 
6.  In addition to the penalties provided in Section II-Penalty Clause of the Subdivision Ordinance (Ordinance 1203, as amended), the city may also seek damages equivalent to the replacement costs of the trees that were removed or destroyed without authorization.

A.  General Policy. 
1.  Easements should normally be provided along the front, rear or side lot lines. 
2.  Utility easements shall be a minimum of ten feet in width, unless otherwise specified in this chapter or approved by the city planner. 
3.  A ten-foot utility easement shall be required adjacent to street rights-of-way to accommodate the location of underground and overhead utilities according to standardized locations promulgated by the city manager and the Tarrant County Utility Coordinating Council. 
4.  Easements can be required by the city to be highly restrictive. In such cases the city will draw the easement instrument to be executed by the subdivider prior to approval of the plat. 
5.  When the city finds that easements in areas adjoining a proposed subdivision are necessary to provide adequate drainage or to provide utilities, the subdivider shall obtain such easement. 
6.  Drainage easements shall generally be located along the existing drainageway and should be of sufficient width for the designed improvements to be installed and enough extra width for maintenance equipment to be able to work. 
7.  All drainage easements shall be so designed to allow maintenance equipment to enter the easement and be able to perform the necessary work. 
8.  Employees of the city of Benbrook and its agents shall have the authority to enter premises at any time for the purpose of inspecting, repairing or constructing within any easement. 
B.  Utility Easements. 
1.  Any franchised or authorized public utility, including the city of Benbrook, shall have the right to move and keep moved all or part of any building, fences, trees, shrubs, other growths or improvements which in any way endanger or interfere with the construction, maintenance, or efficiency of its respective systems in any of the easements shown on the plat; and any public utility, including the city of Benbrook, shall have the right at all times of ingress and egress to and from and upon such easements for the purpose of construction, reconstruction, inspection, patrolling, maintaining and adding to or removing all or part of its respective systems without the necessity at any time, of procuring the permission of anyone. 
2.  All easements which will be used for water and/or sewer facilities, or which may potentially be used in the future for water and/or sewer facilities shall be a minimum of fifteen feet in width. Easements may be greater or lesser than fifteen feet in width as required by the Benbrook Water Authority. 
C.  Public Open Space Restriction. 
1.  A triangular public open space easement (P.O.S.E.) is required on corner lots at the intersection of two streets (including alleys and private streets.) The triangles shall be described as starting at a point fifteen feet behind the curb line on the intersecting street and extending along the street a distance of ten feet for every mile per hour of posted speed (ten feet per mph) to a point six feet inside of the curb line (see Figure below.) Two triangles are required on each leg of the intersection. 

2.  These open space easements will remain in effect unless vacated by ordinance adopted by the city council of Benbrook. 
D.  Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, natural channel or stream, there shall be provided an easement or right-of-way conforming substantially to the limit of such watercourse, plus additional width to accommodate future needs as determined by the comprehensive plan and the city manager. Natural waterways and channels should be used wherever practical to carry runoff. Any modification to an existing waterway and channel requires approval by the city engineer and city manager. 
1.  Storm drainage easements of fifteen feet minimum width shall be provided for existing and proposed enclosed drainage systems. Easements shall be centered on the systems. Larger easements, where necessary, shall be provided as directed by the city engineer. 
2.  Storm drainage easements along existing or proposed open channels shall provide sufficient width for the required channel and such additional width as may be required for ingress and egress of maintenance equipment; to provide clearance from fences and space for utility poles; to allow maintenance of the channel bank; and, to provide necessary slopes along the bank. 
3.  Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road right-of-way lines and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 
4.  When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat or other instrument as approved by the city attorney. In the case of clear public interest, the city may participate in easement acquisition by power of condemnation.

(Ord. No. 1313, § 4, 12-16-2010) 
16.28.025 - Streets. 
A.  General. 
1.  Street Layout. The arrangement, classification, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the thoroughfare plan and the official street construction standards and shall be designed in accordance with the following provisions: adequate streets shall be provided by the subdivider and the arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of each shall conform to the comprehensive plan of the city and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public safety and convenience, and in their appropriate relationship to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. The street layout shall be devised for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood. 
2.  Relation to Adjoining Street System. Where necessary to the neighborhood pattern, existing streets in adjoining areas shall be continued, and shall generally be as wide as such existing streets in alignment therewith. 
3.  Projection of Streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into such unsubdivided areas. 
4.  Boundary Streets. When land proposed to be subdivided is partially or totally bounded on one or more sides by a street or thoroughfare having a right-of-way width of less than that specified in this section, additional right-of-way shall be dedicated to provide one-half of the ultimate right-of-way width. A half-street along adjoining property that has not been subdivided may be shown on the general development plan of an entire subdivision, but no lots fronting upon such half-street shall be included in the subdivisions that are approved. Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining land is subdivided. The other half of the street shall be platted within the adjacent tract at the time it is platted. When land proposed to be subdivided is partially or totally bounded on one or more sides by a street way or thoroughfare having a width of less than that specified in this section, such land shall be laid out so as to provide street widths specified in this chapter. 
5.  Streets on Comprehensive Plan. Where a subdivision embraces a street as shown on the comprehensive plan of the city, such street shall be platted in the location and of the width indicated by the comprehensive plan. 
6.  Design of Local Streets. Local streets shall be laid out so as to serve only local traffic and to discourage their use by through traffic. Local streets in residential subdivisions shall be designed in a curvilinear manner, except when: 
a.  In the determination of the planning and zoning commission, the shape or topography of the subdivision, or existing pattern of the adjacent street would make the provision of such curvilinear streets impractical; or 
b.  The subdivision is part of and conforms to an unexpired preliminary plat approved prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter and the design standards and criteria. 
7.  Adequate Access. To insure adequate access, there should be at least two planned points of ingress and egress to each subdivision with more than twenty lots. 
8.  Access to Collectors and Arterials. 
a.  Residential Access. Individual lot access to arterials and collectors for subdivisions zoned A, B, BR, C, or CR shall be prohibited. Lot access to minor collectors shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the city. The design should provide a minimum number of access points to collector streets. 
b.  Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial, the planning and zoning commission shall require that access to such streets be limited where possible by: 
i.  The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial and front onto a parallel local street with no access from the arterial; 
ii.  Providing a series of cul-de-sac, U-shaped local streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to a parallel street, with the rear lot lines of their terminal lots backing into the arterial; 
iii.  Lots to side onto the arterial with a non-access restriction on the arterial side; 
iv.  Reverse frontage with screening and containing a non-access restriction along the rear property line; or 
v.  Other treatment as may be necessary or required for adequate protection of adjoining properties, and as approved, by the commission after taking into consideration the proposed method of off-street parking and maneuvering which will prevent the necessity of backing into the arterial. 
    Subdivisions serving areas in a single-family residential zoning district that abuts on or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector street should be designed so that direct vehicular access from any lot to such street is prohibited. The design should provide a minimum number of access points to collector streets. 
9.  Arterial Intersections. Wherever possible, arterials should be intersected only by collector streets or other arterials, rather than local streets. No offsets at the intersection of two collector streets and/or arterials shall be permitted. There shall be a minimum of six hundred feet between intersections of arterials and/or collector streets. 
10.  Relation to Lots. All streets should be planned so that all resulting lots shall be sufficient size and shape to conform to applicable zoning regulations. Streets should be platted to allow two tiers of lots between streets when possible. 
11.  Street Right-of-Way. The subdivider shall be required to dedicate appropriate right-of-way for all streets required within or abutting such subdivision in accordance with the adopted thoroughfare plan and Tables 16.1 and 16.2. 
12.  Visibility Triangles. Visibility triangles in the form of public open space easements (P.O.S.E.) shall be provided at the intersection of all public streets and the intersection of all public streets and alleys and/or private streets as required in Section 16.28.020(C) of this chapter. The easement shall prohibit any obstruction within the easement from a height of twenty-four inches to a height of eleven feet above the top of the adjacent curb. Utility poles and guy wires may be located in the P.O.S.E. Other ground-mounted electrical and communication equipment and switch gear may be located within the P.O.S.E. when the location is coordinated with the city planner. 
13.  Street Names. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or cause confusion with the names of existing streets, unless the new streets are a continuation of, or in alignment with existing streets, in which case names of existing streets shall be used. Streets shall be named to provide continuity with existing streets. All streets shall be named and the name approved before the final plat is submitted. Final approval of street names shall be by the city planner. 
14.  The reservation in private ownership of strips of land at the end of proposed or existing streets and intended solely or primarily for the purpose of controlling access to property not included in the subdivision shall be prohibited. 
15.  Each subdivision shall have a street connectivity index of at least 1.4, unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
B.  Street Costs and City Participation. The owner or developer shall be responsible and pay all costs for the design and construction of streets within the proposed development. The developer shall build these streets in accordance with city standards. 
C.  Traffic Impact Analysis Required. Five copies of a traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required for any development that will generate more than 100 trips per peak hour using data from the most recent edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. In general, this includes any development with more than 100 dwelling units or shopping area with more than 20,000 square feet of floor area. Traffic Impact Analysis studies shall be prepared by a qualified traffic engineer using generally accepted techniques. The study shall include, as a minimum: 
1.  Analysis of existing traffic levels (some data is available from the city); 
2.  Trip generation and distribution of proposed development; 
3.  Capacity analysis and level of service on affected roadways; 
4.  Identification of traffic impacts, needs and deficiencies; and 
5.  Recommendations for site access and off-site improvements. 
    As a general policy, the city of Benbrook has adopted the level-of-service C as the minimum acceptable congestion level for Benbrook roadways. Review and approval of the traffic impact analysis and any required improvements shall be made by the city engineer. 
D.  Design Requirements. Design requirements are summarized in Tables 16.1 and 16.2. All streets shall have curb and gutter for drainage control. Curb, gutter and paving requirements for streets, unless otherwise specified, shall follow the Standard Specifications for Public Work Construction (latest edition) of the North Central Texas Council of Governments. 
1.  Pavement Widths. Streets shall be designed to the width required by the thoroughfare plan, Tables 16.1 and 16.2 or as may be specified by the planning and zoning commission. All pavement widths shall be measured from the face of one curb to the face of the opposite curb. Wider pavement widths shall be provided when required by the planning and zoning commission to handle increased or unusual traffic conditions.

Notes: 
1. May be used for subdivisions in "SD" and "RE" districts. 
2. The City Engineer may require a pavement design. 
3. Rural design may be used on lots zoned SD, RE, or A with lot areas exceeding 11,000 SF and lot widths exceeding 80 feet. Grass-lined swales shall be designed and approved by the City Engineer. 
2.  Street Section. The city of Benbrook's minimum street section for a local residential street shall be not less than six inches of lime stabilized subgrade and six inches of reinforced concrete, with a minimum crown of five inches. The minimum section for collector and arterial streets is six inches of lime or cement-stabilized subgrade and seven inches reinforced concrete with concrete curb and gutter. As a part of the soils test for determining lime or cement content, a pavement design shall be provided for arterials. The design shall be in accordance with AASHTO Guidelines and shall be based upon a twenty-year design life. Commercial and industrial-use roadways shall have a minimum section of six inches of lime or cement-stabilized subgrade and seven inches of concrete with concrete curb and gutter. A pavement design shall be provided for commercial and industrial use roadways. A parabolic crown shall be provided in accordance with the city's standard details. Any concrete for street sections shall have a minimum compressive strength of three thousand six hundred pounds per square inch (psi) (five and one-half sack). The city engineer may require more stringent design requirements in locations of unusual soil or traffic conditions. When required, twenty-four inch monolithic concrete curb and gutter shall be provided in accordance with the city's standard details. In all cases, the developer's engineer shall conduct geotechnical tests which may dictate an increase in the pavement section. Any deviations from the typical sections shall require the approval of the city engineer. 
    The developer's engineer shall provide soil tests to determine by recommendation of a reputable soil testing laboratory the degree of lime stabilization of the subgrade is needed in conjunction with the reinforced concrete pavement. The recommendations shall address the percentage of lime to be applied. As a part of the soils test for determining lime or cement content, a pavement design shall be provided for arterials, industrial and commercial streets. The design shall be in accordance with AASHTO Guidelines and shall be based upon a twenty-year design life. A pavement design shall be provided for commercial and industrial use roadways. A parabolic crown shall be provided in accordance with the city's standard details. The distance between expansion joints shall not exceed six hundred feet. 
    All materials furnished for the paving of streets and all construction methods shall fully conform to the appropriate sections of the standard specifications for public works construction (NCTCOG). 
    Curb and gutter shall be constructed as detailed and specified in the standard specifications for construction. 
3.  Street Alignment. A curved street pattern that follows the topography is preferred to a grid pattern imposed upon the land. This provides use of the streets for drainage purposes, a more interesting pattern of development, and slows traffic driving through residential neighborhoods. Streets should traverse the topography in the following manner: 
a.  Cross streams and drainageways at a right angle; this minimizes bridge and culvert costs; 
b.  Streets on sloping terrain should gradually cross hills rather than directly up and down; 
c.  Cul-de-sacs and loop streets should curve with the flow of the topography to best handle drainage; 
d.  Where possible, drainage should be away from the cul-de-sac or loop street; 
e.  Property boundaries should not serve as the primary basis for street layout, with other property features (topography, soils, vegetation, etc.) serving as the overall guide. 
4.  Intersections. Intersections shall be designed to as near right angles as possible and in no case shall vary from ninety degrees by more than five degrees without specific authorization by the planning and zoning commission. Curb returns at intersections shall be in accordance with Tables 16.1 and 16.2. If the intersection angle between any two streets varies by more than five degrees from a right angle, the minimum curb return shall be determined and approved by the city engineer. 
    Wherever possible, street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred fifty feet for local streets shall be avoided. No street jogs or offsets are permitted for collector or arterial streets. 
    Intersections should have only two streets intersecting at right angles. This provides the safest type of intersection. Other types of intersection include: 
a.  "T" Intersection. These are useful for discouraging through traffic and should be used more than one hundred fifty feet away from any other intersection. 
b.  "Y" Intersection. These occur when three streets intersect at a common point. "Y" intersections shall not be permitted. 
    Visibility triangles shall be provided at all street intersections, either as dedicated right-of-way or as a public open space easement. The minimum triangle shall be that provided in Section 16.28.020(C), though additional open space easement may be required when necessary to achieve the necessary sight distances. The city shall utilize the sight distance requirements established by the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Guidelines for Urban Major Street Design (1990) in making its determinations. Recommended sight distances are as follows: 
Arterial streets with median 500 feet Arterial streets without median 800 feet Collector streets 300 feet Minor streets 200 feet  
5.  Dead-end Streets, Cul-de-sacs and Loop Streets. 
    Dead-end Streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited except as short stubs to permit future expansion. Such short stubs longer than one hundred thirty feet in length shall be provided with an approved turnaround having a minimum radius of fifty feet. Temporary dead-end street shall have provisions for future extension of the street and utilities and, if the temporary cul-de-sac is utilized, a reversionary right to the land abutting the turn-around for excess right-of-way shall be provided. 
    Cul-de-sacs. A street ending permanently in a cul-de-sac should not be longer than six hundred feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty feet, and a street property line diameter of at least one hundred feet. On extra wide lots, cul-de-sacs may be longer if approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
    When the planning and zoning commission determines that there is a reasonable expectation that a dead-end street will be extended within two years, construction of a temporary cul-de-sac may be approved. The planning and zoning commission may waive temporary cul-de-sac requirements for dead-end streets when the street is less than two hundred feet in length. The portion of the temporary cul-de-sac which will serve as an extension of the street shall be constructed in accordance with the city standards and that additional portion of the temporary cul-de-sac shall be in accordance with the city standards for a permanent cul-de-sac. "Adequate, all-weather turnaround" is defined as a turnaround that is of sufficient size to accommodate fire and sanitation vehicles and is of a construction quality comparable to standard road cross sections. 
    Cul-de-sacs and loop streets should drain to other streets, if possible. 
6.  One-Way Streets. Unless otherwise approved by the city planner, one-way streets are prohibited in the city. 
7.  Minimum and Maximum Grades. Street and alley grades should conform to the natural terrain where possible and shall conform to the requirements in Tables 16.1 and 16.2. 
8.  Horizontal Curves. Minimum and maximum horizontal curves shall be in accordance with Tables 16.1 and 16.2. These requirements may be made more stringent by the city engineer if deemed necessary to provide minimum stopping distance, sight distance, design speeds, and other safety requirements consistent with good engineering practices. 
9.  Design Speeds. Unless otherwise approved by the city council, design speeds shall be in conformance with Tables 16.1 and 16.2. 
10.  Curbs and Gutters. Curbs shall be installed by the developer on both sides of all interior and perimeter streets. The city has adopted the seven-inch high curb as the standard for all streets. In limited places where monolithic curb is not provided after approval by the city, the gutter shall be eighteen inches wide. Alternative curb designs shall be approved by the city engineer for rural section local streets. 
    The subgrade for curb and gutter typically shall consist of six inches of lime or cement-stabilized base material. In cases where lime stabilization is not feasible, six inches of mechanically compacted crushed stone or six inches of two sack concrete ("2:27") may be used as base material. The stabilized base must extend six inches beyond the curb and gutter. 
    The curb and gutter shall be constructed monolithically in accordance with the city's standard details and standard specifications. Concrete shall be five-sack, three thousand six hundred psi design with two #3 steel bars placed longitudinally with the curb and gutter. Joints shall be scribed in the curb and gutter at distances no greater than twelve feet and expansion joints placed at each radius or linear distances of two hundred fifty feet or less. Any pavement damaged during curb and gutter installation must be restored to meet city specifications. 
    All improvements shall be subject to inspection and approval of the city inspector. All work shall be subject to tests as prescribed by the city inspector, with the cost of such tests borne by the developer or his contractor. If a test fails to meet specifications, the contractor shall bear the expense of removing the faulty section delineated by the city inspector, reconstructing the section, and performing any subsequent tests required by the city inspector. 
    Wheelchair ramps shall be provided at all street intersections, unless otherwise approved in writing by the city engineer. Wheelchair ramps shall also be provided at driveway curb returns where the location of the curb return intersects the sidewalk and results in a barrier to handicapped access. Wheelchair ramps shall be provided in commercial and industrial parking lots that are required to provide handicapped parking spaces. All wheelchair ramps shall be constructed in accordance with the city's standard details and in compliance with ADA requirements. 
11.  Driveways and Median Openings. 
    Driveways. The location of driveway ingress or egress from any lot onto a collector or arterial shall be approved by the city inspector. Driveways shall provide a minimum of eighteen feet between the property line and any garage door, gate, or other obstruction to provide for safe parking or stack space off of the public right-of-way. The location and size of all driveways serving multi-family residential, commercial and industrial properties shall be subject to the approval of the city inspector. The city council manager shall promulgate design standards for such facilities. 
a.  Residential Driveway Access to Arterial Streets. Residential driveway access to arterial streets should not be permitted except for major multiple-family "cluster" developments. 
b.  Number of Direct Access Driveways (Curb Cuts). Each landowner is entitled to access to the city street and thoroughfare system; however, it is city policy to limit the number of driveways entering streets and thoroughfares to protect public safety and maintain traffic efficiency. Therefore, each landowner is entitled to only one driveway for each lot or parcel. Additional drive approaches shall be approved only when it has been determined that the additional driveway is necessary for adequate traffic circulation and that street efficiency and safety are preserved. Circle drives on one-family lots fronting on local streets will be generally permitted when the city inspector determines that traffic safety is not hindered. 
    No driveway shall be located within two hundred feet of the intersection of an arterial with an arterial, one hundred twenty-five feet of the intersection of an arterial and a collector, or seventy-five feet of a street intersection of a collector and local or within fifty feet of a local and local street unless no other point of access can be provided. Likewise, driveways shall be located a minimum of seventy-five feet from any median opening unless the median opening directly serves the driveways. Deviations from these standards shall be allowed only upon approval of the city planner. Except for residential driveways on local streets, driveways should be located directly opposite each other to minimize the potential points of conflict. The use of common driveways for adjacent property shall be encouraged. 
    Driveways entering onto access roads of controlled access highways shall be prohibited for a distance of one hundred feet before the intersection of roadway surfaces on exit ramps to a point three hundred feet after the intersection of the travelways. Driveways are prohibited for a distance of one hundred feet before the intersection of travelways on any entry ramp to a point one hundred feet beyond the intersection of roadway surfaces and otherwise meet or exceed all other requirements of the Texas Department of Transportation. 
    Whenever the use of any driveway approach is abandoned and not used for ingress and egress to the abutting property, it shall be the duty of the abutting property owner to restore the curb to the standards of the city. 
c.  Minimum Spacing Between Driveways. 
i. Street Classification Separation of Curb Cuts Primary Arterials (P6D) One per 300 feet of frontage Secondary Arterials (M4U) One per 200 feet of frontage Collector (RC) One per 100 feet of frontage Local (residential) 10-foot separation unless joint access  
ii.  It is the policy of the city to discourage driveway cuts onto the major arterials of the city. Driveway cuts onto the city's major streets will be allowed only when: 
(A)  There is no other feasible alternative; or 
(B)  Traffic engineering studies clearly show a need. 
iii.  Additional driveways other than permitted in the table above will be allowed under the following conditions: 
(A)  If the daily volume using one driveway would exceed five thousand vehicles (both directions); 
(B)  If the on-site, peak-hour traffic volume exceeds five hundred vehicles per hour (both directions); 
(C)  A competent professional traffic analysis shows that traffic conditions warrant more driveways. Part of this study must include data indicating volumes compared to above standards and must show how alternative arrangements, joint access, etc., will not work. 
iv.  Right-turn deceleration lanes and associated additional right-of-way shall be provided when the peak hour right-turn movements exceed forty per hour. Deceleration lanes shall be at least one hundred feet long with a one hundred-foot transition. 
d.  Sight Distance, On-site Maneuvering and Parking Lot Design. Adequate site distance and on-site maneuvering should be available from every driveway. Any movement for which adequate sight distance is not available or any parking lot design that does not provide adequate on-site maneuvering should not be permitted. For example, if parking is within twenty-five feet of the driveway for commercial or multi-family developments under three acres or within fifty feet of the driveway for commercial or multi-family development over three acres, either the parking should be rearranged or joint access should be considered or access to another street should be sought. Adequate driveway throat length shall be provided to reduce congestion. 
e.  Median Openings. If and when medians are constructed on any arterial street, spacing between median openings should be at least four hundred feet. The spacing may be reduced if a competent traffic study shows that a lesser spacing will still safely and efficiently accommodate left-turn movements to existing and projected future development in the immediate vicinity. 
f.  Width of Driveway Approaches. 
i.  Residential. Residential driveways to serve single car garages, carports, and/or storage areas shall be not less than ten feet nor more than twenty feet in width, measured at the property line. Residential driveways to serve two car garages, carports, and/or storage areas shall be not less than eleven feet, not more than twenty-four feet in width, measured at the property line. When residential driveways are required to serve three or more car garages, carports, and/or storage areas, the size and location of the driveway(s) shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer, after an adequate engineering analysis of the parking, maneuvering and access requirements. A driveway should not begin less than five feet from the point of tangency of the corner radius of an intersection. 
    Driveways shall provide a minimum of eighteen feet between the property line and any garage door, gate, or other obstruction to provide for safe parking or stack space off of the public right-of-way. 
    The radius of all driveway returns shall be a minimum of five feet. Residential driveways shall not be constructed closer than ten feet apart. If permitted, low density residential driveways entering onto collector or arterial streets shall have a minimum curb return radius of ten feet. 
    Joint driveway approaches may be approved provided a letter of agreement signed by all adjoining property owners is delivered to the city inspector or designee. 
ii.  Commercial, Industrial and Multi-family Residential. The location of ingress and egress for all commercial, industrial and multi-family residential driveways shall be subject to the approval of the city inspector. Driveways should not exceed sixty-five percent of the property frontage. Driveways shall have a minimum width of twelve feet for a one-way drive and twenty-four feet for a two-way drive. The maximum width shall not exceed thirty feet unless otherwise approved by the city inspector. 
    The minimum radius of a commercial, industrial or multi-family residential driveway shall be ten feet, but twenty feet may be required in most locations. 
12.  Private Streets, Gated Communities and Common Area Regulations. 
a.  Intent and Purpose. It is the intent of these private street and common area regulations to: 
i.  Allow private street developments to occur within the city of Benbrook on a limited and restrictive basis; 
ii.  Provide for private street developments as one type of residential development alternative to allow the city of Benbrook to expand housing types as compared to other metroplex cities. 
    There shall be no required minimum or maximum acreage size and/or number of lots within private street developments. However, minimums and maximums will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the planning and zoning commission. 
    The location of each private street development will be subject to the approval of the planning and zoning commission on a case by case basis, based upon, among other matters, the criteria described in this chapter. An applicant who meets the stated criteria will not be entitled to the private street subdivision as a matter of right, but shall only obtain approval for the private street subdivision at the sole discretion of the planning and zoning commission, after review by city staff. 
b.  Compliance with Other Laws. In order to qualify for consideration of private streets, the applicant must satisfy the criteria of the city of Benbrook comprehensive zoning ordinance, as amended; the city of Benbrook subdivision ordinance as amended; and any other applicable codes and ordinances, as may be, from time to time amended. 
    Denial of approval of any private street development by the planning and zoning commission shall be final and shall not be reviewable by the Benbrook city council or zoning board of adjustment. 
c.  Guidelines for Development. The following guidelines are to be satisfied as part of the review and approval process for all private street developments: 
i.  The area must be within the corporate limits of the city of Benbrook, or within the Benbrook Extraterritorial Jurisdiction; 
ii.  The area shall be a proposed residential development, and shall be zoned solely as a residential zoning district (that is, a zoning district the stated purpose of which is to provide for primarily residential uses), except in the case of a planned development (PD) zoning district, in which case the area must be designated solely for residential use; 
iii.  Only the following zoning districts shall allow consideration of private street developments: 
    RE - Residential Estate District, 
    A - One Family District, 
    B - One Family District,

v.  The area may not disrupt an existing or proposed city of Benbrook public pedestrian pathway, hike and bike trail or park. 
d.  General Requirements. 
i.  The private street system must comply with design standards in the Benbrook subdivision ordinance. All rules and regulations in the subdivision ordinance to "public right-of-way" shall apply to private street lots, including right-of-way and street width and paving requirements, sidewalk and street lighting requirements. The commission will entertain proposals for creative quality alternative streetscape developments that achieve the goals of adequate vehicle and pedestrian access. 
ii.  The private street system shall provide perpetual access for police and other emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and service personnel, solid waste collection services, the U.S. Postal Service, and government employees in pursuit of their official duties. 
iii.  The type of gate or controlled access mechanism is subject to the approval by the city of Benbrook's fire marshall, and any corrective action shall be the responsibility of the property owners association. The city of Benbrook shall bear no responsibility or liability in connection with the removal or destruction of any gate or other controlled access mechanism while engaged in an emergency action. 
e.  Specific Requirements. 
i.  Each private street development plat shall contain the following wording on the face of the plat. "The streets have not been dedicated to the public, for public access nor have they been accepted by the city of Benbrook as public improvements, and the streets and roadways shall be maintained by the property owners association within the subdivision, except that the streets and roadways shall always be open to emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and service personnel, solid waste collection services, the U.S. Postal Service, and governmental employees in pursuit of their official duties." 
ii.  All private street developments will be approved concurrent with the final plat. The planning and zoning commission shall consider the private street development after review and recommendation by the city staff. 
iii.  Easements. Private street developments shall provide the following easements: 
(A)  "Public utility, drainage and storm sewer" easements containing private streets and public utilities; 
(B)  Additional public utility assessments required by public agencies; 
(C)  Pre-existing easements unaffected by the platting process; and 
(D)  Such private service easements, including, but not limited to, utilities, fire lanes, streetlighting, government vehicle access, mail collection and delivery access, and utility meter reading, access, as may be necessary or deemed mutually convenient by the applicant and the city. 
iv.  Access. To insure adequate access to each subdivision, there should be at least two points of ingress and egress, except for approved cul-de-sacs. The second entry may be designated for emergency access only. 
v.  Private Access Amenity Plan. For each private street development, a private access amenity plan shall be submitted to the city planner for review and approval in consultation with public safety and other city departments. At a minimum, the private access amenity plan shall include a scale drawing showing the plan and profile of all walls, gates, entry areas, landscaping, architectural features, and signs, etc. This will provide opportunity to review proposed controlled access mechanisms, access points, landscaping, screening walls, or similar buffering barriers, and other related private street components. 
vi.  The city staff may request rendered perspectives and elevations of proposed structures, including description of proposed building materials, roof pitches, signage, and showing relationships to adjacent structures and such other items as the city staff might reasonable request (such renderings of elevation of proposed structures does not refer to residential structures, but rather to other structures that are components of the private street development). 
vii.  The city staff may require additional data to amplify and clarify the private access amenity plan; such information may include, but not be limited to, fencing, access controllers, entrance areas, barriers, perimeter walls, and exterior landscaping. 
viii.  No credit will be allowed for the development of private parks, not open to the public, except as may be provided in Section 16.04.045 of this code. 
ix.  Except as may otherwise be provided in a PD-zoning approval, building lines shall be provided in accordance with the zoning ordinance from the edge of the private street lot. 
f.  Conversion of Public Streets to Private Streets. For existing subdivisions with public streets and rights-of-way to become private, the following procedures shall apply: 
i.  The permit application must contain the signatures of all the owners of the lots that would be part of the proposed private street subdivision. 
ii.  The street right-of-way must be purchased from the city in accordance with Chapter 272 of the Texas Local Government Code. The planning and zoning commission shall first review the application and forward a recommendation to the city council. If the recommendation is favorable and the city council concurs, the city council shall order an appraisal of the street rights-of-way in the affected subdivision. The cost of such appraisal shall be borne by the applicants, and the appraisers conclusion of value shall be final. 
iii.  Once the conversion takes place, all of the other provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to the private street subdivision. 
g.  Relationship to the City of Benbrook Comprehensive Plan. The following components shall be elevated when reviewing potential private street developments. This evaluation will aid in logical implementation of the current city of Benbrook comprehensive plan and the following components may be hereafter amended. 
i.  Future Land Use Plan. Development impact on land uses, their configuration and function shall be examined as part of each request for a private street development. 
ii.  The Master Park Plan. The proposed private street development shall be evaluated to assess impact of private streets on access, including ingress and egress, and continuity of the hike/bike/jogging/open space linkage system within the community, as well as the functioning of other park plan and trail system plan elements of the comprehensive plan. 
iii.  Thoroughfare Plan. The proposed private street development shall be evaluated to assess its impact on the efficiency, convenience, and safe functioning and implementation of the thoroughfare plan element of the comprehensive plan. 
h.  Public Improvement Districts and Property Owners Associations. 
i.  Public Improvement District Required. Developers proposing subdivisions with private streets shall petition the city council for the creation of a public improvement district to maintain the private streets as provided in Chapter 372 of the Local Government Code. If the proposed development is adjacent to an existing public improvement district, the developer shall petition to be added to the preexisting district. 
ii.  Property Owners Association. In lieu of the public improvement district and upon approval of the planning and zoning commission, subdivisions with private streets and/or common areas and facilities may have an approved property owners association. The property owners association shall require membership by all property owners within the subdivision, and have provisions to assess and/or place liens on owners for nonpayment of street and common area maintenance dues. The property owners association shall own and be responsible for the maintenance of private streets, appurtenances and common areas and facilities. The property owners association shall provide for the payments of dues and assessments required to maintain the private streets and common areas. The property owners association covenants and bylaws shall be approved by the city staff and city attorney. The approved document must be filed for record contemporaneously with the filing of the final plat in the county records department. 
iii.  Street and Common Area Maintenance Reserve Fund. The property owners association covenants and bylaws shall establish a Street Maintenance Reserve Fund for the maintenance, repair and reconstruction of private streets, access controlled structures and equipment and common areas and facilities. The cost of maintenance and replacement of stormwater detention ponds may be excluded from this requirement to the extent that the city's stormwater utility will provide maintenance and repairs in accordance with Administrative Regulation CD-4. This reserve fund shall not be co-mingled with any other property owners association funds. Each property owner shall be assessed annually to be placed in the Street and Common Area Maintenance Reserve Fund. After five years of existence, the accumulated balance of the fund shall not be less than five dollars per front foot of each lot. The formula for calculating the reserve fund may be reviewed and amended as needed upon approval by the city. The property owners association shall provide the city an audited statement of the fund's balance, upon request. 
iv.  The property owners association's covenants shall contain provisions that allow the city of Benbrook to assume the duty of performing the maintenance obligations should the property owners association dissolve or in any way fail or refuse to maintain its obligations. The covenants shall further provide that the city of Benbrook may use the outstanding balance in the Street and Common Area Maintenance Reserve Fund for maintenance or in the alternative, levy an assessment upon each lot on a pro rata basis for the cost of such maintenance. 
v.  Membership Requirements. Every lot owner within the development shall be a member of the property owners association. 
vi.  The property owner's association documents shall indicate that the streets within the development are private, owned and maintained by the property owners association and that the city of Benbrook has no obligation to maintain or reconstruct the private streets or common areas and facilities. The covenants shall include the following provision. 
"The property owners association shall be responsible for contacting the City of Benbrook Inspection Department every two (2) years, or as needed, from time of construction to schedule an inspection by city staff and/or their designee of the private streets or private roadways and common areas and facilities." 
vii.  The property owners association covenants and bylaws shall include language, approved by the city attorney, whereby the association agrees to fully indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city, its officers, agents, and employees, from any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs or causes of action of any nature whatsoever, whether real or asserted, brought for or on account of any injuries or damages to persons or property including death, resulting from or in any way connected with the construction, maintenance or operation of the private streets and common areas and facilities. 
i.  Conversion of Private Streets to Public Streets. 
i.  Voluntary Conversion. The city of Benbrook may, but is not obligated to, accept private streets for public access and maintenance. The procedure must conform to all of the following provisions: 
(A)  The property owners association must submit a petition signed by one hundred percent of its members; 
(B)  All of the streets and roadways must be in a condition that are acceptable to the city of Benbrook; 
(C)  All access controllers and other structures not consistent with a public street development must be removed; 
(D)  If any maintenance of the streets and roadways is required, the city of Benbrook may use the outstanding balance in the reserve fund for such maintenance. Any remaining balance in the fund shall be returned to the lot owners at the time the private street and/or roadway is converted back to a public street on a fair and equitable basis to be determined by the city council. 
(E)  Each lot owner shall execute an instrument of dedication for filing of record, the form of which shall be approved by the city attorney's office. 
j.  Design Standards. The design and construction of the infrastructure within a private street subdivision shall conform to the same rules, regulations, standards, and specifications established for public subdivisions. The city manager or his or her designee is authorized to promulgate rules, regulations, standards, and specifications for the design and construction of improvements unique to a private street subdivision. The same shall be filed with the city secretary at least thirty days before they shall become effective. An amendment may be made from time to time, provided that the amendment is filed with the city secretary at least thirty days before it becomes effect. No such rules, regulations, standards or specifications shall conflict with this or any other ordinance of the city of Benbrook. 
i.  Structures. 
(A)  Project perimeter fences at project entry access points, entry monuments, and access controllers, may be erected within the public utility, drainage and storm sewer easement(s), provided they do not impede the installation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of public utilities and storm sewers within the easement. 
(B)  Where access controllers are a part of a larger, multipurpose structure, only that portion of the structure which functions as access controllers may encroach the building line adjacent to the private street. 
k.  Streetlights on Private Streets. The developer shall submit a streetlighting plan for review and comment by the city staff. Streetlighting shall generally conform to the standards in Section 16.28.045, though alternate poles and luminaries may be used that achieve the same level of illumination. It shall be the responsibility of the property owners association to pay for the cost of operating the streetlights on private streets. 
13.  Alleys. 
a.  Widths and Paving. Any alleys installed in commercial or industrial areas shall be not less than thirty feet in right-of-way width and pavement. Alleys in residential areas are prohibited, unless specially approved by the planning and zoning commission. All alley paving shall be constructed in accordance with city standards. Alleys shall be approximately parallel to the frontage of the street and shall be less than one thousand six hundred feet in length unless specifically approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
b.  Intersecting Alleys or Utility Easements. Where two alleys or utility easements intersect or turn at a right angle, a cut-off of not less than ten feet from the normal intersection of the property or easement line shall be provided along each property or easement line. 
c.  Dead-End Alleys. Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted. 
d.  Commercial and Industrial Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts where other definite and assured provisions are not made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading, parking and firefighting access consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys in commercial and industrial areas shall have a minimum right-of-way and pavement width of thirty feet and a minimum pavement thickness of seven inches of reinforced concrete pavement or eight inches of HMAC over six inches of lime or cement-stabilized subgrade. A pavement design shall be provided by the developer for commercial and industrial alleys. The minimum inside radius of any curve shall not be less than twenty feet. 
e.  Residential Areas. Alleys are not permitted. 
f.  Turnouts. Alley turnouts shall be paved to the property line and shall be at least twelve feet wide at that point. The paving radius where an alley intersects an arterial shall be twenty feet, and shall be ten feet at intersections with all other streets. 
g.  Alleys should intersect streets at right angles or radially to curved streets. 
h.  In cases where two alleys intersect or turn a sharp angle, lot corners shall be platted so that a triangular area of twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet or greater, is dedicated as part of the alley for the purpose of providing a minimum radius of thirty feet to the inside edge of the alley paving. 
i.  Alley paving should have a minimum grade of 0.4 percent and a maximum grade of ten percent. 
14.  Traffic Control and Street Signs. The developer shall provide all street identification signs and attachment hardware for streets within the subdivision. The street identification signs shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements in the design standards and criteria. The developer shall provide poles and any necessary traffic control signs (such as stop signs) as directed by the city engineer. 
15.  Sidewalks, Hike and Bike Trails and Parkways. Unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning commission, sidewalks shall be installed as follows: 
a.  On the subdivision side of all arterials and collector streets adjacent to the subdivision; 
b.  On both sides of all internal arterial, collector, and local streets of a subdivision; 
c.  Such additional sidewalks as the subdivider may desire; 
d.  Sidewalks shall be placed in the right-of-way and shall be a minimum of five feet in width, but must be at least six feet in width if placed at the back of the curb; 
e.  Swept corner or other approved handicapped access curb ramps shall be provided at all intersections and crosswalks. 
    Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete in accordance with the city standard specifications and in accordance with the city standard design details. Sidewalks shall have a minimum pavement thickness of four inches of reinforced concrete with a minimum compressive strength of three thousand pounds per square inch. Sidewalks shall have a minimum cross slope of 0.015 foot per foot for drainage. 
    Parkways shall be graded with a slope not less than 0.015 foot per foot. Except as otherwise provided by city ordinance or policy, no other structures or trees and shrubs shall be placed in the parkway. Landscaping plans for the parkways must be approved by the Benbrook parks and recreation board. 
    Any subdivision that contains or adjoins a route for a bike trail as shown in the current comprehensive plan shall provide sufficient right-of-way and construct the portion of the bike trail that lies within or adjacent to the subdivision. The bike trail pavement shall be at least ten feet in width made of concrete to AASHTO design standards. Right-of-way dedication for this purpose may be used as a credit toward parkland dedication requirements in Section 16.04.045. 
    Sidewalks shall be installed at the time of subdivision construction for all commercial, industrial, and multifamily subdivisions. In single-family residential subdivisions, sidewalks for each lot may be installed by the home builder at the time of home construction during the first four years after acceptance of the subdivision. At the time of final plat submittal, the developer shall submit a cash or performance bond (or other approved financial assurance instrument) to construct twenty percent of the required sidewalks. At the end of the four-year period, the developer shall construct the remaining sidewalks in the subdivision, or the city shall exercise the bond and construct them. The city shall refund any funds not required for sidewalk construction at the end of the four-year period. 
16.  Parking Lots. The required number of parking and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the city's zoning ordinance. Parking shall be designed to facilitate efficient traffic movement with a minimum conflict. All parking maneuvers shall be accomplished off of public right-of-way. Off-street parking layouts shall afford the driver the ability to accomplish all maneuvers to enter or exit the parking spaces on private property. Adequate stack space shall be required for entrances into parking lots to prevent congestion backing onto the arterial. 
    Off-street parking areas shall be maintained by the owner. 
    Except for projects in the MU-mixed use zoning district, no new "head-in" parking is permitted, except for one- and two-family residential lots. Existing head-in parking may be required to be eliminated when the city engineer determines that prevailing traffic conditions require the elimination of existing head-in parking that makes use of public rights-of-way to correct a serious traffic hazard. 
    Nothing in this section shall require the changing of existing driveways and/or parking except under one or more of the following conditions: 
a.  During widening and/or reconstruction of streets, the driveways will be brought into conformity with the present standards and head-in parking will be eliminated; or 
b.  During new building construction or major additions and remodeling of existing buildings all driveways and parking requirements will be brought into conformity with the present standards and head-in parking will be eliminated. 
    Parking lots should be designed with a minimum pavement thickness of five inches of five-sack concrete with a minimum compressive strength of three thousand pound per square inch reinforced with #3 bars on twenty-four-inch centers in both directions over fill sand, lime or cement-stabilized subgrade or equivalent. Alternative porous pavements (such as concrete pavers, grass pavers, or gravel pavers) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
17.  Fire Lanes. Fire lanes shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements for fire apparatus access roads in the International Fire Code as adopted by the city of Benbrook, unless otherwise specified herein. The location requirements for fire lanes shall be established by the city fire marshall. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the required fire lanes are constructed, inspected and approved. 
    Fire lanes shall have a minimum width of twenty feet and shall have a minimum vertical clearance of fourteen feet. The minimum inside turning radius shall be twenty-five feet and the minimum outside turning radius shall be forty-five feet. All dead-end fire lanes exceeding one hundred feet in length shall have a turn-around with minimum radius of fifty feet. Fire lanes shall not have a grade exceeding ten percent. Fire lanes shall be clearly marked as a fire lane and parking prohibited. Markings must be maintained at all times. 
    Fire lanes shall be constructed of an all-weather pavement designed and maintained to support a twelve thousand five hundred pound wheel loading. Unless otherwise approved by the city engineer, such pavement shall consist of five-inch thick concrete pavement in light traffic areas and six-inch thick concrete pavement in areas expected to receive heavy truck traffic, such as service drives. In both cases, pavement shall a minimum of five and one-half sack concrete with a minimum compressive strength of three thousand six hundred pounds per inch reinforced with #3 bars on twenty-four inch centers in both directions. In both cases, concrete shall be poured over stabilized subgrade. The developer or contractor shall submit a pavement design for the fire lanes prior to construction and the construction must be inspected. The contractor shall provide test results verifying the strength of the concrete, at the direction of the city inspector. 
18.  Medians. Medians shall not be constructed in dedicated public right-of-way unless specifically required by and/or approved by the planning and zoning commission. Medians approved for aesthetic purposes shall be maintained by, and at the expense of, the dedicator in accordance with specific contractual arrangements with the city. Medians required for traffic control shall be designed for minimum maintenance. 
(Ord. 1258 § 6 (part), 2008; Ord. 1231 § 5, 2007; Ord. 1203 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1122 § 1 (part), 2002) 
(Ord. No. 1313, § 5, 12-16-2010; Ord. No. 1345, § 3, 10-18-2012) 
16.28.030 - Blocks and lots. 
A.  Blocks. 
1.  The length of a block shall be considered to be the distance from property corner to property corner measured along the property line of the block face of greatest dimension, or on which the greatest number of lots face. The width of a block shall be considered to be the distance from property corner to property corner measured along the property line of the block face of least dimension, or on which the fewest number of lots face. The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplates, zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, and needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. 
2.  Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand six hundred feet, nor be less than five hundred feet. 
3.  When the length of any block exceeds one thousand two hundred feet, the subdivider or developer shall be required to dedicate a portion of property to the city which will divide the block widthwise, so as to allow utilities, drainage, or other accommodations in the best interest of the immediate and adjacent properties. The exact width of such dedication shall be determined by the commission. 
4.  Where long blocks in the vicinity of a school, park or shopping center are platted, the Commission may require a public walkway near the middle of long blocks or opposite a street that terminates between the streets at the ends of the block. If required, the walkway shall be not less than five feet in width, and shall have a concrete walk of a minimum width of five feet through the block from sidewalk to sidewalk, or curb to curb, or if no street, to the property line adjacent to school, park or shopping center. 
B.  Lots. 
1.  The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and the character of surrounding development. 
2.  All side lines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. Rear lot lines should be straight and avoid acute angles with side yard lines. Odd-shaped lots should be avoided. Where utility easements are to be located along rear lot lines, these lines should be as straight as possible for long lengths. 
3.  No lot shall have less area of width at the building line than is required by the zoning regulations that apply to the area in which it is located. 
4.  Lots shall be consistent with zoning regulations. When the specific proposed use of a lot or tract depends upon future action by the city council or other properly designated authority, lot lines shall also be shown on the preliminary plat appropriate to a use that does not require such action. Proposed uses shall be shown on the preliminary plat. 
5.  Generally lots should be deeper than they are wide. It is recommended to have the depth twice the width. The important consideration is to assure that the lots are neither too deep nor too shallow to allow for good placement of a dwelling unit on a lot. 
6.  Corner lots shall be wider than interior lots so that dwellings can be placed further from the street. Corner lots shall be ten to twenty percent wider than interior lots. Lots facing onto heavy traffic streets shall be avoided. This can be accomplished by providing deeper lots with the houses backing onto the heavy traffic street. Other methods include: 
a.  Providing an access street parallel to the major street; 
b.  Cul-de-sac if the property has sufficient depth; or 
c.  Provide a loop street, if the property has sufficient depth and width. 
7.  Surface drainage must be diverted away from house sites to a public right-of-way or dedicated drainage easement. Sufficient slope must exist on the lot to enable drainage to runoff from the building site across sidewalks, and onto the street. Swales may be needed to provide drainage from backyards. 
8.  Building Lines. Front and second front building lines shall be shown on all lots in the subdivision. The building lines shall be listed in accordance with the minimum applicable to the zoning district. Building lines on plats may exceed the minimum required by the zoning ordinance. 
9.  Orientation to Creeks and Streams. Any lots that are contiguous to the major stream channels (Mary's Creek, Clear Fork-Trinity River, Timber Creek, or Walnut Creek) shall be oriented so that their front shall face the creek across a public street. 
10.  Orientation to Public Parks. No more than fifty percent of the boundary of a public park may be contiguous to the rear lot line of residential lots. All other residential lots must face the public park across a public street. 
(Ord. 1203 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1122 § 1 (part), 2002) 
(Ord. No. 1313, § 5, 12-16-2010) 
16.28.035 - Drainage. 
A.  General. 
1.  Conformance with Comprehensive Plan. The developer shall provide those drainage improvements which traverse or abut the proposed subdivision, where specified in the comprehensive plan. All cost for such improvements shall be paid by the developer, except where the city manager shall determine that the improvements benefit other citizens more than that of the proposed subdivision and shall determine the equitable city participation in such improvements. Such city participation, or any appeal of such requirements, shall be approved by the city council. 
2.  To protect health, safety and environmental quality, it shall be the policy of the city of Benbrook that no new development will be allowed within the one hundred-year floodplain, as delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Undeveloped land within the floodplain may be used for agricultural purposes, be incorporated into adjacent lots outside of the floodplain, or set aside as private or public open space. 
3.  Development shall not increase the peak flow discharge or velocities over natural conditions, particularly on adjacent and downstream properties for the one-year, twenty-five-year or one hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm events. When preliminary drainage studies indicates that peak flows or velocities will be increased, then detention basins or other techniques shall be designed to reduce flows to natural conditions. 
B.  Drainage Facilities. Drainage facilities shall be provided and constructed as specified by the city engineer. Streets may be used for conveyance of surface runoff within the following standards: 
1.  Local streets shall have the capacity to carry a twenty-five-year storm-flow without topping the curbs and that the one hundred-year storm-flow will be contained within the right-of-way. 
2.  Collector streets shall have the capacity to carry a twenty-five-year storm-flow without topping the curb and have at least one lane of traffic open at all times. The one hundred-year storm flow shall be contained within the right-of-way. 
3.  Arterials shall have the capacity to carry a twenty-five-year storm-flow without topping the curb and maintain at least one open lane of traffic in each direction. The one hundred-year storm flow shall be contained within the right-of-way. 
4.  The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend for approval any plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provisions for storm or floodwater runoff channels or basins. Drainage provision shall ensure the health and safety of the public and the property in times of flood. 
5.  Development shall not increase the peak flow discharge or velocities over natural conditions to adjacent and downstream properties, unless the discharge is into a dedicated drainage easement with channel capacity to contain the increased flow. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and inlets shall be used to intercept flow at that point. 
6.  The applicant may be required by the planning and zoning commission to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that exists previous to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in the perpetual unobstructed drainage easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the construction standards and specifications of the city of Benbrook. 
7.  Storm drainage facilities shall be designed in accordance with the iSWM(tm) Criteria Manual for Site Development and Construction (2010), including the Local Provisions adopted by the City of Benbrook, unless otherwise specified herein. Approval of storm drain facilities necessary and construction requirements shall be the responsibility of the city engineer. Where there is a question as to the justification of size of the facility required, the question will be resolved in favor of additional drainage capacity. 
8.  Coordination with the comprehensive plan drainage element (when applicable) is required. The developer shall provide those drainage improvements which traverse or abut the proposed subdivision, where specified in the comprehensive plan. All costs for such improvements shall be paid by the developer, except where the city engineer shall determine that the improvements benefit other citizens more than that of the proposed subdivision and shall determine the equitable city participation in such improvements. Such city participation, or any appeal of such requirements, shall be approved by the city council. 
9.  Drainage facilities shall be provided and constructed by the developer in accordance with the iSWM(tm) Criteria Manual for Site Development and Construction (2010) , including the Local Provisions, the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction and the following basic requirements: 
a.  All drainage improvements shall be designed to an acceptable outfall as approved by the city engineer. 
b.  The developer may install an approved open channel in lieu of installing pipe larger than sixty inches. This open channel shall be at the rear of residential lots and shall be adequately armored with a material approved by the city (e.g., concrete, rock gabions, etc.). In the event it is necessary to locate the drainage facility adjacent to and parallel to a street, it shall be a closed conduit even though pipe sizes larger than sixty inches are required. 
c.  A permanent chain link fence or other fence meeting the requirements of the city shall be constructed along the top of any channel exceeding three feet in depth to enclose the area where it is adjacent to residential lots and also in other cases, where it is deemed necessary to restrict access to the channel. 
d.  All drainage facilities shall be constructed on public right-of-way or easements dedicated for the purpose. Drainage easements shall be of a sufficient size to permit access for maintenance of the drainage facility. The easement shall be designed to facilitate maintenance access to the drainage channel by city crews and equipment. Additional easements shall be required at any access points and the access points shall be designed to restrict access by unauthorized personnel. An access point will typically be required at every intersection of the drainage easement with street right-of-way. 
e.  When a drainage ditch or storm drain pipe, culvert or bridge is proposed, calculations shall be submitted showing basis for design. 
f.  When a drainage channel, storm drain pipe, culvert or bridge is proposed, completed plans, profiles and specifications shall be submitted, showing complete construction details and detailed cost estimate. 
g.  Detention/Retention Ponds: Retention (maintains a permanent pool elevation) and detention (no permanent pool storage) shall be designed in accordance with the iSWM(tm) Criteria Manual for Site Development and Construction (2010), including the local provisions. Retention/detention ponds shall be encompassed by an easement. The facility will remain the maintenance responsibility of the owner/developer or property owners association, unless otherwise accepted by the city. Acceptance by the city will be contingent upon the facility being a part of a dedicated park or other such property which meets with the city's approval. Preservation of major floodplains is strongly encouraged and detention/retention may be required if a proposed drainage improvement is found to create actual or potential upstream, adjacent or downstream property damage due to the creation of excessive flood velocities or heights. Refer to 16.28.035.C. for additional criteria. 
h.  The owner or developer of property to be developed shall be responsible for all storm drainage flowing on his property. This responsibility includes the drainage directed to that property by ultimate development as well as drainage naturally flowing through the property by reason of topography. 
i.  The subdivider shall pay for the cost of all drainage improvements required for the development of the subdivision, including any necessary off-site channels or storm sewers and acquisition of the required easements. 
j.  Where it is anticipated that additional runoff incidental to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, whether natural or manmade, the planning and zoning commission may withhold approval of the subdivision until appropriate provision has been made to accommodate the problem, and plans shall be provided which include all necessary off-site improvements including storm sewer systems, channel grading, driveway adjustments, culvert improvements, etc. 
k.  In areas where downstream pipes or channels are inadequate to handle proposed increased flows, the city, as one alternative, may consider accepting cash payment in lieu of actual drainage improvements. The developer must show that the proposed pipe system to handle the flow from his development would not function properly without substantial downstream improvements. Prior to permitting any development that will significantly increase flood heights downstream or upstream, a hearing before the planning and zoning commission is required with special notice to the adjacent property owners. 
10.  Off-Site Drainage. 
a.  Adequate consideration shall be given by the owner in the development of property to determine how the discharge leaving the proposed development will affect adjacent property. 
b.  On lots or tracts of three acres or more where storm water runoff has been collected or concentrated, it shall not be permitted to drain onto adjacent property except in existing creeks, channels or storm sewers unless proper drainage easements or notarized letters of permission from the affected property owners are provided. Such letters of permission shall be recorded in the property records of Tarrant County. 
C.  Detention. Runoff from sites larger than one acre must not exceed pre-development levels for the one-year, twenty-five-year and one hundred-year twenty-four-hour events. Multi-phase developments will be considered as a single entity in determining the requirement for detention. 
    No increase or concentration of storm water may be conveyed off-site without easements and/or downstream drainage improvements. Increased storm water runoff attributable to new development must not exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system. If no downstream drainage system exists, increased storm water runoff must not adversely affect adjoining property. In cases where the proposed runoff would exceed the capacity of downstream facilities, the developer will be required to provide detention to prevent overloading of downstream systems. 
    In all new developments where storm water runoff has been collected or concentrated, discharge shall be conveyed off-site by creeks, channels or storm sewer systems. Easements shall be provided by the developer to the city for off-site drainage facilities, as well as for on-site facilities. All flows shall be discharged in a non-erosive manner, and shall meet the established regulations governing storm water quality. 
    The developer shall pay for the cost of all drainage improvements required, including any necessary off-site channels or storm sewers and acquisition of the required easements. 
    If it is anticipated that additional runoff caused by the development will overload any existing downstream drainage facility, whether natural or improved, and result in hazardous conditions, approval of the improvements for the proposed subdivision may be withheld until appropriate provision has been made to accommodate the problem. If existing capacity is not available downstream and property damage could occur, the owner or developer shall provide a drainage system or detention facility to mitigate the deficiency. In any case, a letter of acknowledgement shall be obtained from the downstream property owner indicating that the downstream property owner is aware of proposed drainage improvements impacting drainage on or to said owner's property. 
    Permanent impoundments of water shall be constructed in such a way that negative effects on aesthetics, function, flooding, health, and safety are minimized. Such improvements shall be allowed at the discretion of the city engineer. The developer shall be responsible for all necessary permitting required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for impounding public water. The city engineer may require calculations and/or other documentation that no negative impact is created. 
    All storage facilities serving drainage areas greater than fifty acres shall be designed and analyzed using reservoir routing of an inflow unit hydrograph. The software program or computational method must be approved by the city engineer. The analysis should consist of comparing the design flows at a point or points downstream of the proposed storage site with and without storage. Design calculations shall show the effects of the detention facility in each of the one-, twenty-five-, and one hundred-year storm events. This may require the use of multi-stage control structures. The detention facility shall be designed to provide the required detention for all of the above-listed frequencies. 
    Detention storage facilities serving drainage areas smaller than fifty acres may use the modified rational method or unit hydrograph method for storage calculations. All calculations must be provided to the city engineer for review and approval. 
    Detention facility embankments shall be designed to provide a minimum freeboard of one foot above the one hundred-year stormwater elevation. Certain impoundments are subject to state of Texas regulations. 
    Outlet structures shall be designed to intercept sediment and floatables from the twenty-five-year storm. The potential for the impact of sedimentation on the detention facility should be evaluated. A means of access for maintenance of the facility shall be provided. 
    The outlet control structures for storage facilities typically include a principal outlet and an emergency overflow. The principal outlet functions to restrict the outflow and cause the runoff to use the available storage volume. The principal outlet shall be designed to accommodate the multiple frequency storms listed above while maintaining the minimum freeboard of one foot. The emergency overflow shall be paved and provide positive overflow. 
    The outlet control structure may be drop inlets, pipes, culverts, weirs, or orifices. Checks should be made to determine if the outlet structure is controlled by weir or orifice flow. The tailwater on the structure could significantly affect its capacity. The engineer should carefully evaluate the tailwater depth. For detention facilities in a series, the lower facility should not cause inundation of the upper outlet control structure. The calculation of the hydraulic capacity for outlet control structures is based on the type of structure used, using standard hydraulic calculations. 
    All Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) requirements for impoundments and dam safety shall apply. These requirements relate to both the size and the hazard classification of the embankment. Copies of all materials submitted to TCEQ for permitting, along with the TCEQ permits, must be submitted to the city engineer.

16.28.040 - Water and sanitary sewer. 
A.  Water Installations. 
1.  Water Supply and Distribution. All subdivisions shall be provided with water supply and distribution systems approved by the Benbrook Water Authority. All public water systems shall be connected to the existing Benbrook Water Authority distribution system. 
2.  Fire Hydrants. Standard fire hydrants shall be installed as part of the water distribution system in accordance with specifications of the State Board of Insurance and the Benbrook Water Authority manager. Fire hydrants shall be spaced no further than six hundred feet apart along the street in a single-family residential subdivision and no more than three hundred feet along streets in multiple-family, commercial or industrial subdivisions. The spacing and location of fire hydrants is subject to approval of the city fire marshal. 
B.  Sewers. 
1.  All subdivisions shall be provided with an approved sewage disposal system.

    In the case of reversed frontage corner lots, a front yard of the required depth shall be provided on either frontage, and a second front yard of the depths required for second front yards in the district shall be provided on the other frontage. 
    In the case of corner lots with more than two frontages, the planning director shall determine the front yard requirements, subject to the following limitations: 
1.  At least one front yard shall be provided having the full depth required generally in the district; 
2.  No other front yard on such lot shall have less than the minimum required second front yard for corner lots. 
    Depth of required front yards shall be measured at right angles to the front lot line. 
    "Yard, rear" means a yard extending across the rear of the lot between lot lines. In the case of through lots there will be no rear yards, but only front and side yards. All other lots will have rear yard. (See Figure 17.08-3) 
    Yard, side" means a yard extending from the rear line of the required front yard to the front of the required rear yard, or in the absence of any clearly defined rear lot line to the point on the lot farthest from the intersection of the lot line involved with the public street. In the case of through lots, side yards shall extend from the rear lines of front yards required. (See Figure 17.08-3) Width of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the side lot line. 
    Depth of a required rear yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the rear lot line. 
    In cases where a rear lot line is not evident, or if evident but not parallel to the front building line, the minimum rear yard requirement shall be the distance from the rear-most point of the lot along a line from that point drawn perpendicular to a line drawn from the foremost points of the two side lot lines, providing that the rear yard is parallel to at least one lot line along the rear of the lot. 
    "Yard, special." A yard behind any required yard adjacent to a public street, required to perform the same functions as a side or rear yard, but adjacent to a lot line so placed or oriented that neither the term "side yard" nor the term "rear yard" clearly applies. In such cases, the Planning Director shall require a yard with minimum dimensions as generally required for a side yard or a rear yard in the district, determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of the lot on which the yard is to be located to the adjoining lot or lots, with due regard to the orientation and location of structures and buildable areas thereon.

CHAPTER 17.16 - BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 

17.16.010 - Purpose. 
    It is the declared purpose of this title that non-conforming uses be eliminated and be required to conform to the regulations prescribed in the preceding articles of this title, having due regard for the property rights of the persons affected when considered in the light of the public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the designated non-conforming use and the conservation and preservation of property. The governing body shall, from time to time, on its own motion or upon cause presented by interested property owners, inquire into the existence, continuation or maintenance of any non-conforming use within the city. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.020 - Organization. 
    A board of adjustment shall be established and have all the powers and authority in accordance with the Charter of the City of Benbrook and Section 211.008, Local Government Code, as amended. The board of adjustment shall consist of five voting members, appointed by the city council. Board members shall serve two-year terms, with Places 1, 3, and 5 appointed in odd numbered years and Places 2 and 4 appointed in even numbered years. In addition, the city council may appoint up to four (4) alternates to serve in the absence of any board member. The board shall elect a chairperson from its members. Any member or alternate of the board of adjustment may be removed for just cause by the city council. "Just cause" as that term is used herein shall include three unexcused absences from meetings, regular or special, of the board of adjustment. Vacancies shall be filled by appointment by the city council of a suitable person to serve out the unexpired term of any person whose place on the board of adjustment, either as a member or as an alternate, has become vacant for any cause. 
    The board of adjustment may adopt rules to govern its proceedings, providing, however, that such rules are not inconsistent with the terms of this title. Meetings of the board of adjustment shall be held at the call of the chairman, who may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board of adjustment shall be open to the public. The board of adjustment shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicate such fact and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be filed in the offices of the board of adjustment and kept as public record. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.030 - Jurisdiction. 
    The board of adjustment shall have all powers granted by and be organized and controlled by the provisions of Section 211.009, Local Government Code. The board of adjustment is hereby vested with power and authority, and in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, to make such exemptions and exceptions to the terms of this title in harmony with its general purposes and intent in accordance with general or special rules herein contained for the purpose of rendering full justice and equity to the general public. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.040 - Appeals. 
    Appeals to the board of adjustment can be taken by any person aggrieved by any officer, department, or board of the municipality or affected by any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within fifteen days after the decision has been rendered by the administrative officer, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of adjustment, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
    An appeal shall stay all proceeding of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise, than by restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application, after notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken on due case shown. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.050 - Hearing. 
    The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of any appeal, variance, special exception, or other matter which the board of adjustment is authorized to review hereunder, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties and interests and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by attorney or agent. The notice provided in this section shall be given by publication in the official city publication stating the time and place of such hearing, which shall not be earlier than ten days from the day of such publication, and in addition thereto, the board of adjustment shall mail notices of such hearing to the petitioner and the owners of the property lying within two hundred feet of any point of the lot or portion thereof, on an appeal, variance, exception or other action is proposed, and to all person deemed by the board of adjustment to be affected, such owners and persons shall be determined according to the current tax rolls of the city and substantial compliance therewith shall be deemed sufficient, provided, however, that the depositing of such written notice in the mail by the board of adjustment shall be deemed sufficient compliance with the purpose of this matter. 
    Any variance or special exceptions authorized by the board of adjustment, either under the provisions of this chapter, or under the authority granted to the board of adjustment under the statutes of the State of Texas, shall authorize the issuance of a building permit for a period of ninety days from the date of the favorable action on the part of the board of adjustment, unless said board of adjustment in its minutes shall, at the same time, grant a longer period. If a building permit shall not have been issued within said ninety-day period or as the board of adjustment may specifically grant the special exceptions shall be deemed waived, and all rights thereunder terminated. Such termination and waiver shall be without prejudice to a subsequent appeal to said board of adjustment in accordance with the rules and regulations regarding appeals. 
    The same appeal to the board of adjustment shall not be allowed on the same piece of property prior to the expiration of one year from a ruling of the board of adjustment on any appeal to such body unless other property in the same zoned areas shall have, within such one-year period, been altered or changed by ruling of the board of adjustment, in which case such change of circumstance shall permit the allowance of an appeal but shall in no way have force in law to compel the board of adjustment after a hearing to grant such subsequent appeal, but such appeal shall be considered on its merits as in all other cases. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.060 - Power. 
    The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
A.  Variances. The board of adjustment may authorize a variance from these regulations when, in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In granting a variance, the board shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to protect the public interest. In making its findings herein below required, the board shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, and the probable effect such variance will have upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety, convenience and welfare in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the board finds: 
1.  That there were special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this title deprive the applicant of reasonable use of his land; and 
2.  That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and 
3.  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area; and 
4.  That the granting of a variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly development of other land in the area in accordance with the provisions of this title. 
    Such findings of the board, together with the specific facts upon which it is based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the board of adjustment meeting at which such variance is granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardship to the applicant, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship. 
B.  Special Exceptions. The board of adjustment may permit a special exception when such use or development is specifically authorized under Section 17.16.090. In reaching its decision the board of adjustment shall determine that the requested exception will establish only those uses permitted under this title, that the location of the proposed activities and improvements are clearly defined on the site plan filed by the applicant; that the exception will be wholly compatible with the use and permitted development of adjacent properties either as filed or subject to such requirements as the board of adjustment finds to be necessary to protect and maintain the stability of adjacent properties. 
    A special exception that has not been implemented within two years of approval shall expire unless specifically extended by the zoning board of adjustment. 
C.  Appeals of Decisions of Administrative Officers. 
1.  The board of adjustment may hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the administrative officer in the enforcement of this title. 
2.  In exercising its power, the board of adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of Chapter 211, Local Government Code, revise or reform, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as sought to be made and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and may require such conditions and safeguards as the board finds necessary to preserve the spirit and intent of this title. 
D.  Non-Conforming Uses. 
1.  The board of adjustment may permit the reconstruction, extension or enlargement of a building occupied by a pre-existing non-conforming use on the lot occupied by such building provided such reconstruction does not prevent the return of such property to a conforming use. 
2.  The board of adjustment may require the discontinuance of non-conforming uses under any plan whereby the full value of the structure or use can be amortized within a definite period of time, taking into consideration the general character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to conform to the regulations of this title. 
3.  The board of adjustment may determine whether an existing nonconforming animal lot, barn or stable may continue, may continue with additional restrictions, or be discontinued if petitioned under the provisions of Section 17.100.130. In making its determination, the board shall consider public health, animal welfare, and nuisance conditions, as well as the general character of the neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.070 - Concurring vote. 
    The concurring vote of four members of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the administrative officer, or to decide in favor of the application on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this title or to affect any variance in this title. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.080 - Grievances. 
    Any person or persons, jointly or separately, aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment or any taxpayer or any officer, department or board of the city may present to a court of record, a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of such illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within ten days of the questioned decision of the board of adjustment, and not thereafter, and shall comply in all respects with the requirements set forth in Section 211.011 of the Local Government Code. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.16.090 - Authorized special exceptions. 
    The following special exceptions may be permitted by the board of adjustment, in the district specified, subject to full and complete compliance with any and all conditions listed, together with such other conditions as the board of adjustment may impose: 
SPECIAL EXCEPTION DISTRICTS REQUIRING

(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012; Ord. No. 1348, § 2, 7-18-2013; Ord. No. 1398 , § 2, 8-18-2016) 
_____
17.20.020 - Terms defined. 
    The term "more restricted district" means one with fewer permitted uses and the term "less restricted district" means one with more permitted uses. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.20.030 - Zoning map. 
    The districts aforesaid, and the boundaries of such districts, shall be as hereinafter described, and as shown upon the map attached hereto and made a part of this Ordinance, said map being designated "Zoning Map of the City of Benbrook, Texas," and said map and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon shall be a part of this title the same as if all such matters and information were fully described herein. The original of said map shall bear the date with the passing of the ordinance from which this title derives and shall be signed by the mayor and attested by the city secretary, under the seal of the City of Benbrook, Texas; said original map shall be kept in the office of the city secretary in the Benbrook City Hall, and a replica thereof shall be produced upon paper in such reduced scale as will permit its being attached to this tutle. 
    It shall be the duty of the planning director to keep the official maps and current copies up to date, by entering on such maps any changes that the city council may from time to time order by amendments to the zoning ordinance and map. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.20.040 - Boundaries of districts. 
    Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts, as shown on the map accompanying and made a part of this title, the following rules shall apply: 
A.  The district boundaries are either streets, alleys, creeks, pipe lines, electric transmission lines, railroads, or other natural or manmade features not likely to change, unless otherwise shown, and where the districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of this title are bounded approximately by street or alley lines, said street or alley shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. 
B.  Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the district boundaries shall be construed to be lot lines, and where the districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of this title are bounded approximately by lot lines, said lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of such districts unless said boundaries are otherwise indicated on the map. 
C.  On unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the map accompanying and made a part of this title shall be determined by use of the scale contained on such map, unless dimensions are shown. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.20.050 - Newly annexed territory. 
    All territory hereafter annexed into the City of Benbrook, Texas, shall be classified as "SD" suburban district, until permanently zoned by the city council of the City of Benbrook. The planning and zoning commission may, after annexation of any territory into the City of Benbrook, institute proceedings on its own motion to give newly annexed territory a permanent zoning, and the procedure to be followed shall be the same as is provided by law for the adoption of original zoning regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.20.060 - Use Categories. 
A.  Basis for Classifications. Use categories classify land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
1.  Principal Uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristic of each principal use. 
a.  Development with Multiple Principal Uses. When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and services category because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. 
b.  Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are allowed by-right in conjunction with a principle use, unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
c.  Use of Examples. The "examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale warehouse," but that sells mostly to consumers, is included in the retail sales and services category rather than the wholesale sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matched the description of the retail sales and services category. 
B.  Restricted Uses. The city council may identify unique uses to be regulated separately from their related general use categories. The following uses are identified separately from the general use categories and listed within the use charts: 
1.  Auto sales and rental; retail sales and service-Commercial uses. 
2.  Batting cages, outdoor; recreation and entertainment, outdoor-Commercial uses. 
3.  Convalescent home; group living-Residential uses. 
4.  Carwash; vehicle, service limited-Commercial uses. 
5.  Crematories; retail sales and service-Commercial uses. 
6.  Driving range, outdoor; recreation and entertainment, outdoor-Commercial uses. 
7.  Farm implement sales and service; retail sales and service-Commercial uses. 
8.  Food truck park; retail sales and services-Commercial uses. 
9.  Frozen food lockers; warehouse and freight movement-Commerce uses. 
10.  Government installations; office or safety services or community services-Institutional uses. 
11.  Landfill; waste-related-Industrial uses. 
12.  Miniature golf, outdoor; recreation and entertainment, outdoor-Commercial uses. 
13.  Office, temporary residential sales; office-Commercial uses. 
14.  Printing services; manufacturing and production-Industrial uses. 
15.  RV camping; retail sales and services-Commercial uses. 
16.  RV storage; retail sales and services-Commercial uses. 
17.  Sexually oriented business; retail sales and services-Commercial uses. 
18.  Skating rinks, outdoor; recreation and entertainment, outdoor-Commercial uses. 
C.  Similar Use Interpretation Criteria. The following considerations shall be used in making similar use interpretations: 
1.  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category; 
2.  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;

    The community facilities district is for those institutions, health care facilities and related uses that are established in response to the health, safety, educational and welfare needs of the community. These uses are separated from others in the community due to their unique service and often very special area requirements in the community in relation to the whole. Their replacement should not be arbitrary but should be located to respond to the community's needs. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.24.020 - Use regulations. 
    In the "CF" community facilities district, no building or land shall be used and no building shall be hereafter erected, reconstructed, altered or enlarged except for one or more of the uses in Sections 17.24.022 through 17.24.026.

17.74.030 - District design standards. 
    The district design standards are intended to raise the level of quality for mixed use developments within a regulatory structure, while offering options and flexibility. The district design standards are comprised of five major components: 
1.  Building form and development standards, addressing the physical form and placement of buildings in relation to various street types; 
2.  Building design standards, addressing building orientation, and massing and scale; 
3.  Streetscape standards, addressing the natural and built fabric of the street and its visual effect; 
4.  Civic space and open space standards, addressing recreational areas and the preservation and enhancement of natural resources; and 
5.  Neighborhood transition standards, addressing the compatibility of new and existing developments. 
A.  Building Form and Development Standards: 
    The following standards place an emphasis on the form of the building and the open spaces, whether a pedestrian plaza or a civic space. The goal is to build structures that can be utilized for a variety of uses and, thereby, extend the functional and economic viability of the building. Where any of the building standards within this chapter conflict with the standards of the International Building Code (IBC) adopted at the time of development, the IBC standards shall prevail. 
    The following street designations shall be established for all streets within the "MU" District. Street designations shall be based on the functions of the street and in accordance with the below street types as defined in Chapter 7 of the Comprehensive Plan and the Master Thoroughfare Plan: 
1.  Arterial Street. The arterial street is a major thoroughfare connecting the City to adjacent cities and to the freeway system. The arterial shall establish a hybrid development context in the "MU" District that has a more pedestrian friendly development context at the intersections of streets and major driveways. Auto-related functions and surface parking is accommodated in the middle of the block. Surface parking shall be screened from the arterial with a "slip lane," on-street parking and/or landscaping. 
2.  Collector Street. The Collector Street carries traffic which connects local residential and commercial areas within the City. The Collector is intended to balance pedestrian orientation with automobile accommodation. 
3.  Local Street. The local street is intended to provide the most pedestrian-friendly development context. Buildings along local streets shall be held to the highest standard of pedestrian-oriented design. The local street carries traffic from within a neighborhood to collector and arterial streets. 
4.  Alley. A public way permanently reserved as a secondary means of access. 
5.  Interior Street. A vehicular driveway located in the interior of lots providing access to parking and outbuildings and may contain utility easements. Interior streets which provide access across a lot shall comply with the streetscape standards.

E.  To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. 
(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012) 
17.92.020 - Authority. 
    These sign regulations are adopted under the zoning authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in Section 17.04.020 of this title. 
    The effect of this title as more specifically set forth herein, is: 
A.  To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this title; 
B.  To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this title, but without a requirement for permits;

    All applications for sign permits of any kind shall be submitted to the inspections department. 
C.  Fees: Application and permit fees for each sign shall be as established by the city council. Application fees shall be nonrefundable. Each application for a sign permit shall be accompanied by the applicable fees, which shall be established by the city council from time to time by resolution. 
D.  Not to Issue to Persons Previously Failing to Pay Fees: The building official shall not issue a sign permit to any person who has previously failed or refused to pay any fees or costs assessed against him under the provisions of this title, until such fees are paid. 
E.  Completeness: Within five days of receiving an application for a sign permit, the building official shall review it for completeness. If the building official finds that it is complete, the application shall then be processed. If the building official finds that it is incomplete, the building official shall, within such five-day period, send to the applicant a notice specifying why the application is deficient, with appropriate references to the applicable sections of this title. 
F.  Permit Revocable: The building official may suspend or revoke any permit under the provisions of this title whenever he shall determine that the permit was issued in error or on the basis of incorrect or false information supplied, or whenever such permit be issued in violation of any of the provisions of this title or any other ordinance of this city or laws of this state or the federal government. Such suspension or revocation shall be effective when communicated in writing to the person to whom the permit is issued, the owner of the sign or the owner of the premises upon which the sign is located. 
G.  Inspection: The building official shall inspect at times as he deems necessary, each sign regulated by this title for the purpose of ascertaining whether the same is obsolete and whether it is in need of removal or repair. 
H.  Permit Valid Only for Sixty Days: If the work authorized by a permit issued under this title has not been commenced within sixty days after the date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void. 
I.  Removal of Abandoned or Obsolete Signs: Any sign which the building official determines is abandoned or no longer serves a bona fide purpose or use conforming to this title, shall be removed by the sign erector, owner or lessee of the land, buildings, or structure upon which the sign is located within ten days after written notification to do so from the building official. Upon failure to comply with such notice, the building official is hereby authorized to cause the removal of such sign, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the sign erector, owner or lessee of the land, building or structure to which such sign is attached or upon which it is erected. Effective two years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this title derives, when a sign panel on a nonconforming multi-tenant sign advertises an abandoned business, is blank for a period of six months, or is removed, the sign cabinet or case containing that panel shall be removed from the nonconforming sign. 
J.  Removal or Repair of Dilapidated, Deteriorated or Unsafe Signs: If the building official shall determine that any sign is dilapidated, deteriorated, unsafe, insecure, or is a menace to the public, he shall give written notice to the owner, lessee or sign erector for such sign. Conforming signs may be repaired or removed, while nonconforming signs must be removed. If the owner lessee or sign erector fails to remove or repair the sign within ten days after such notice, such sign may be removed by the building official at the expense of the owner of the property upon which it is located. The building official may cause any sign that is an immediate hazard to persons to be removed summarily and without notice and the cost of same shall be paid by the land owner. 
K.  Appeals: Any person aggrieved by the decision of the building official or any city officer, department or board of the city in relation to enforcement of these sign regulation, or who may petition the city for a variance to these regulations, may appeal to the city's board of adjustment. All applications and processing of appeals shall be in accordance with the rules of the board and with applicable city and state law. When in its judgment in specific cases, where the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served and the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be substantially injured, and after public notice and hearing, and subject to the appropriate conditions and safeguards, the board shall have the following powers: 
1.  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building official in the enforcement of this title. 
2.  To authorize the alteration or reconstruction of a nonconforming sign provided such reconstruction does not, in the judgment of the board, increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign and that the long-term goal of bringing signs into compliance is achieved. 
3.  To authorize such variances where the literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would result in an unnecessary hardship, and where such variances are deemed necessary to permit a sign on a specific parcel of land which differs from other parcels of land in the same district by being of such restricted area, shape or slope that a sign cannot be placed on the parcel in a manner commensurate with those signs permitted on other parcels of land in the same district. The modification of the standards established in this title shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, not for financial reason alone, nor shall such modification be granted to permit any person a privilege in placing a sign on a parcel of land not permitted by this title to other parcels of land in that district. 
4.  A hardship is intended to include a change in elevation or curve in a roadway which obstructs visibility. 
5.  No variance may be granted if the granting of that variance will create an unnecessary hardship upon another parcel of land. The board is not authorized to grant a variance of the zone in which a sign is permitted. 
6.  In order to make a finding of hardship and to grant a variance, the board shall find: 
a.  The requested variance does not eliminate any requirement of this title and does not allow any prohibited signs; 
b.  The hardship is not in any way the result of the applicant's own action; and 
c.  The hardship is peculiar to the property of the applicant and not due to the general conditions of the neighborhood. Economic gain or loss shall never be sufficient grounds for the finding of a hardship or the granting of a variance. 
7.  A variance is only for the particular sign for which it was granted and any attempt to change the sign terminates the variance. A change or alteration of a sign requires a new permit, without consideringany prior variance or previous ordinance. If a sign face is removed from a non-conforming sign, then all appurtenant hardware, including the sign cabinet/case associated with that face shall also be removed.

D.  Tree Canopy: Tree canopy is measured by computing the area that the mature canopy will encompass based on the Tree List contained in Table 17.98.060-B. The mature canopies shall be estimated for existing trees on site. Any tree not on the tree list shall be estimated by use of standard landscaping references. 
E.  Artificial Lot Line: An artificial lot is intended to provide administrative relief for large sites that will achieve planting areas that exceed substantially more than twenty percent of gross platted lot area after development is completed. The use of artificial lots is limited by the following: 
1.  If the platted property is over two acres in size, the applicant may request permission to create an "artificial lot" to satisfy the requirements of this Subsection. 
2.  The planning director may approve the creation of an artificial lot only if the spirit and intent of this chapter will not be violated. If approved by the director, artificial lot lines shall be indicated on the proposed landscape plan and shall contain, at minimum, the total amount of impervious surface coverage, plus twenty percent of the area inside the artificial lot reserved for required planting area. 
3.  The area within the artificial lot lines shall provide trees and landscaping in compliance with the requirement of this section, and may not extend beyond the property boundaries of a single platted lot. 
4.  The artificial lot lines must be delineated on plans approved by the director prior to the issuance of a building permit. The area outside the artificial lot shall be maintained as planting area with live vegetation determined by the applicant. No trees located outside the artificial lot lines may be used for tree credits.

(Ord. No. 1344, § 1, 10-18-2012; Ord. No. 1356, § 9, 10-17-2013; Ord. No. 1398 , § 10, 8-18-2016) 
17.98.080 - Landscape/irrigation plan requirements. 
A.  Qualification to Prepare Plans: Landscape plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect, landscape designer or landscape contractor knowledgeable in plant materials and landscape design. Irrigation plans shall be prepared by a licensed irrigator or landscape architect, and may be submitted after the landscape plan is in approvable form. Irrigation permits are required from the Benbrook Water Authority (BWA) and owner must conform to all BWA regulations. 
B.  Landscape Plan Requirements: The following items shall be provided on the required landscape plan: 
1.  Sheet size twenty-four-inch by thirty-six-inch, or as approved; 
2.  Acceptable scale: 1? = 10', 1? = 20', 1? = 40', or as approved; 
3.  North arrow, graphic and written scale; 
4.  Appropriate title (i.e. "Landscape Plan"); 
5.  Title block, including street address, legal description, and date of preparation; 
6.  Name and address of owner; 
7.  Name, address and telephone number of person preparing plan; 
8.  Property line shown with dimensions;
