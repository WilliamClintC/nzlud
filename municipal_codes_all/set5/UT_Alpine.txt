		
PREFACE
In 2018, codification and administration of the Municipal Code began in-­house under the direction of City Recorder, and with the assistance of Municipal Code Online, Inc. This City Code shall be cited as the Municipal Code of Alpine City or “MCA” as its acronym.

Municipal Code of Alpine City (MCA) comprises three core elements:

A Code System which provides structure to the Legislation
The Legislation itself (passed by Ordinance, or Resolution in specific cases)
The “Legislative History” of the Legislation
MCA's Code System maintains a structure by subject matter using a decimal numbering system that separates title, chapter and section (for example: 1.01.010). This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching, organizing and referencing the Code, and to assist in subsequent codification as new ordinances are added. Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed for future use and may also be marked as “Reserved” to ease internal expansion. 
The first number in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the title level.
The second series in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the chapter level.
The third series in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the section level.
If there is a fourth series in the sequence, it may designate a subsection level.
MCA's Legislation is passed by Ordinance. Legislations may contain an unordered list (using bullets, discs, squares, etc.), or an alphanumeric ordered list 1, a, i, (1), (A), (a) arranged to show hierarchical relationships. 
Legislative History beneath each legislation identifies the specific legal sources of a section.
The City Code is supplemented from time­ to ­time with amendments and additions made by Alpine City. The specific legal sources that comprise this Code have been adapted during the codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies between the online Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal Code Online, Inc., provides a searchable database of the Code for easy reference and convenience. 

NOTICE: THIS CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ONLINE CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT THE CITY RECORDER.

1.10.010 HEARINGS
 SHORT TITLE. This chapter shall be known as the “Alpine City Administrative Procedures Ordinance." 

 PURPOSE. The Alpine City council finds that the enforcement of Alpine City ordinances, policies, regulations, and applicable state statutes is an important public function vital to the protection of the public's health, safety, welfare, and quality of life. The Alpine City council further finds that providing a hearing to Alpine City employees, citizens, and Alpine City agencies relating to the enforcement of ordinances, policies, regulations, and applicable state statutes through an administrative procedures process conducted by independent, law-trained administrative judges comports with basic due process, simplifies and expedites hearings benefitting Alpine City and citizens, minimizes the impact on the judicial system, and provides flexibility in both the hearing process and in determining remedies and responsibilities. 

SCOPE. Unless a hearing process is provided elsewhere in statute or ordinance, the provisions of this chapter may be applied to any violations of Alpine City ordinances, policies, regulations, and applicable state statutes which occur within Alpine City or relate to such activities subject to Alpine City operations and jurisdiction. No judicial review shall be available to any citizen or Alpine City agency if the provisions of this chapter are not followed.

OTHER REMEDIES AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. The Alpine City Administrator shall have sole discretion in deciding whether to pursue civil remedies or seek administrative enforcement for the violation of any of the City’s ordinances, policies, regulations, and applicable state statutes.

Within fifteen days of the issuance of an "Alpine City enforcement action," Alpine City may request an administrative hearing for the purposed of compelling a responsible person to comply with the action.

The administrative law judge holding a hearing shall arrange for the recording of any hearing. 
RULES OF DISCOVERY AND EVIDENCE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS.

Any responsible person or Alpine City adversely affected by a final administrative order issued pursuant to a hearing may file a petition for review in the Fourth Judicial District Court of the State of Utah in accordance with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. 
A petition for review shall be barred unless it is filed within thirty days after the administrative order is final, unless a statute or city ordinance provides otherwise. 
The record of the administrative hearing including minutes, findings, orders and, if available, a true and correct transcript of the proceeding shall be transmitted to the reviewing court by the party filing the appeal and the costs of producing the record, including any transcripts, shall be borne by the party filing the appeal. If the proceeding was tape recorded, a transcript of such tape recording shall be deemed a true and correct transcript for purposes of this subsection. 
The filing of a petition does not stay execution of an administrative order. Before filing a petition, a responsible person may request the administrative law judge to stay an administrative order.

8.04.080 ABANDONMENT
If the City has conveyed graves by deed with or without restrictions, and the grantee, or persons claiming through the grantee, for more than sixty (60) years: 
have not used portions of the graves for purposes of burial and have not provided for the care of the graves beyond that uniformly provided for all graves of the cemetery, and during the sixty (60) year period have not given the City written notice of any claim or interest in the graves; or
have not used a portion of the graves for purposes of burial and have not kept the graves free of weeds or brush, but have allowed it to remain entirely unimproved for more than twenty (20) years and the graves are located in the portion of the cemetery where they adjoin or are adjacent to improved parts of the Cemetery and by reason of their unimproved condition detract from the appearance of the Cemetery, interfere with is harmonious improvements, and furnish a place for the growth of weeds and brush, then the City shall demand of the grantee or persons claiming through the grantee either of the following:

The fact that a grantee or holder of a grave(s) in the Cemetery has not used portions of the grave(s) for the purpose of burial for more than sixty (60) years shall be prima facie evidence that the grantee or holder had abandoned the grave(s) if during that time the grantee or holder:
has not provided the care to the grave(s) provided uniformly to all grave(s) within the Cemetery;
has not given to the City a written notice of claim or interest in the grave(s); or

be compensated for the grave at the reasonable value of the grave as of the date the certificate is presented to the City;
receive a right to burial to another grave if the right to burial or title to the grave has been sold by the City; or
receive the right to burial to the grave if the City has not sold the right to burial to the grave.

The failure of the licensee or applicant to comply with conditions and requirements of this code or any ordinance of the municipality.
Unlawful activities conducted or permitted on the premises where the business is conducted.
Prior to the revocation of a license or denial of an application to renew business license, the licensee or applicant shall be given a notice which shall state in substance that the governing body intends to revoke the business license or deny the application to renew, together with the reason or reasons therefore, at a regular or special meeting of the governing body (which shall be at least ten days and not more than 30 days from the date notice is sent) and that the licensee or applicant has a right to appear, to be represented by counsel, to hear the evidence against him, to cross examine witnesses and to present evidence as to why the license should not be revoked or the application denied.
The preceding Part shall not apply to applications for licenses for businesses which have not previously been licensed by the municipality, and such applicants need only be informed that their application has been denied.
BRANCH ESTABLISHMENTS. A separate license must be obtained for each separate place of business in the municipality and each license shall authorize the licensee to engage only in the business licensed thereby at the location or in the manner designated in such license, provided, that warehouses and distributing places used in connection with or incident to a business licensed under this section shall not be deemed to be separate places of business or branch establishments.
JOINT LICENSE. Whenever a person is engaged in two or more businesses at the same location within the municipality, such person shall be required to obtain separate licenses for conducting each of such businesses. The license tax to be paid shall be computed at the highest license fee applicable to any of the businesses being conducted at such location. The sale of beer or any other product or service requiring an additional license shall be subject to such additional licensing requirement. Where two or more persons conduct separate businesses at the same location, each such person shall obtain a license for such business and pay the required license tax for such business.
RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION OF LICENSES
No license shall be required for operation of any vehicle or equipment in this municipality when:
Such vehicle is merely passing through the municipality.
Such vehicle is used exclusively in inter city or inter state commerce.
No license shall be required by MCA 9.04, MCA 9.06 or MCA 9.08 of any person whose only business activity in this municipality is the mere delivery in the municipality of property sold by him at a regular place of business maintained by him outside the municipality where:
Such person's business is at the time of such delivery licensed by the Utah municipality or county in which such place of business is situated, and,
The authority licensing such business grants to licensees of this municipality making deliveries within its jurisdiction the same privileges, upon substantially the same terms, as are granted by this section, and,
Neither the property delivered nor any of the facilities  by which it was manufactured, produced or processed are  subject to inspection by authority of this municipality for compliance with health or sanitary standards  prescribed by this municipality, and,  
The truck or other conveyance by which such delivery is made prominently displays at all times a license plate or symbol used by the said licensing authority to evidence such business license. Such plate or symbol shall identify  the licensing authority by which it is issued, shall indicate that it evidences a license issued thereby, and shall  specify the year or term for which it is effective.  
The recorder shall at the request of any person certify a copy of this section to any municipality or county of the state of Utah to which a copy has not previously been certified.  
EXEMPTIONS TO LICENSE. 
No license fee shall be imposed under MCA 9.04 or MCA 9.06  on any person engaged in business for solely religious, charitable, eleemosynary or any other types of strictly non profit  purpose which is tax exempt in such activities under the laws  of the United States and the state of Utah, nor shall any  license fee be imposed on any person engaged in a business  specifically exempted from municipal taxation and fees by the  laws of the United States or the state of Utah; nor shall any  license fee be imposed upon any person not maintaining a place of business within this municipality who has paid a like or  similar license tax or fee to some other taxing unit within  the state of Utah and which taxing unity exempts from its  license tax or fee, by reciprocal agreement or otherwise,  businesses domiciled in this municipality and doing business  in such taxing unit.  
The license assessor and collector may, with approval of the governing body, enter into reciprocal agreements with the proper officials of other taxing units, as may be deemed equitable and proper in effecting the exemption provided for in Part N,1.  
FEE NOT TO CONSTITUTE UNDUE BURDEN ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE. None of the license taxes provided for by MCA 9-450 shall be applied as to occasion an undue burden on interstate commerce. In any case, where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for license to place an undue burden upon such commerce, he may apply to the license assessor and collector for an adjustment of the tax so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable or unfair as to such commerce. Such application may be made before, at or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by affidavit and supporting testimony show his method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the license assessor and collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on such commerce. The license assessor and collector shall then conduct an investigation, comparing applicant's business with other businesses of like  nature and shall make findings of facts from which he shall determine whether the tax fixed by MCA 9.06 is discriminatory, unreasonable or unfair as to applicant's business and shall recommend to the governing body a license tax for the applicant in an amount that is nondiscriminatory, reasonable and fair, and if the  governing body is satisfied that such license tax is the amount that the applicant should pay, it shall fix the license tax in  such amount. If the regular license tax has already been paid, the governing body shall order a refund of the amount over and above the tax fixed by the governing body. In fixing the fee to be charged, the license assessor and collector shall have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales, or employees, or may use any other method which will assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature.

9.10.010 PURPOSE
Residents of the City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The City has a substantial interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The City also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.  

There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the City and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this Chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of City officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding Door-to-Door Solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by Door-to-Door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in Door-to-Door Solicitation, the City adopts this Chapter to promote the City's substantial interests in: 

Respecting citizen's decisions regarding privacy in their residences; 
Protecting persons from criminal conduct; 
Providing equal opportunity to Advocate for and against Religious Belief, Political Position, or Charitable Activities; and 
Permitting truthful and non-misleading Door-to-Door Solicitation regarding lawful Goods or Services in intrastate or interstate commerce. 
The City finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this Chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the City interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated.

9.18.010 GENERAL PROVISIONS, PURPOSES
TITLE. The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the sexually oriented business licensing ordinance. 
PURPOSE. It is the purpose and object of this chapter that the city establishes reasonable and uniform regulations governing the licensing and manner of operations of sexually oriented businesses and their employees in the city. This chapter shall be construed to protect the governmental interests recognized by this chapter in a manner consistent with constitutional protections provided by the United States and Utah Constitutions. The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the regulation and licensing of sexually oriented businesses within the city in a manner which will protect the property values of surrounding businesses and neighborhoods, and residents from the potential adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, while providing to those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses the opportunity to do so. Sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution. Licensing of sexually oriented businesses and employees is a legitimate and reasonable means of ensuring that operators and employees of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and operators do not knowingly allow their businesses to be used for illegal sexual activity or solicitation. There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing neighboring businesses and surrounding residential areas, causing increased crime and downgrading of property values. The purpose of this chapter is to control the adverse effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and guests of city, protect the citizens from increased crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values and character of the surrounding neighborhoods, and deter the spread of urban blight. 
APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS. This chapter imposes regulatory standards and license requirements on certain business activities, which are characterized as sexually oriented businesses. It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Utah, but to impose content-neutral regulations which address the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses. Nothing in this chapter is intended to supersede or nullify any other related ordinances including, but not limited to, the Municipal Code of Alpine City, Utah. 
OBSCENITY. Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to permit or allow the showing or display of any material which is contrary to the provisions of the City of Alpine Municipal Code, or other applicable federal or state statutes prohibiting obscenity.

None
PREPARATION. The pavement, sidewalk, driveway, or other surface shall be cut vertically along the lines forming the trench in such a manner as to not damage the adjoining pavement or hardsurfacing. An undercut bevel at the rate of one inch per foot of thickness will be provided at the proposed junction between the old and new surfaces. The portion to be removed shall be broken up in a manner that will not cause damage to the pavement outside the limits of the trench. However, any pavement damaged by operations outside the limits of the trench shall be removed immediately from the site of the work. 
BACKFILL
Materials for backfill will be of select nature. All broken concrete, peat, decomposed vegetable matter and similar materials obtained from excavation will be removed from the site prior to beginning of backfilling. All backfill will be place in layers not over eight inches loose measure in thickness. Compaction will be obtained by mechanical rollers, mechanical tampers or similar means. Material for backfilling will have optimum moisture to insure compaction to a degree equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Jetting or internal vibrating methods of compacting sand fill or similar methods of compacting sand or similar granular free draining materials will be permitted.
The density (dry) of the backfill under pavements, sidewalks, curbs, or other structures will be not less than that existing prior to excavation. The fill shall be restored and placed in a good condition which will prevent settling.
RESTORATION OF SURFACES
General. All street surfacing, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, or other hard surfaces falling in the line of the excavation which must be removed in performance of the work shall be restored in kind by the excavator, unless otherwise directed by the city council, in accordance with the specifications contained herein governing the various types of surfaces involved.
Protection of Paved Surfaces. In order to avoid unnecessary damage to paved surfaces, track equipment shall use pavement pads when operating on or crossing paved surfaces.
Time. In traffic lanes of paved streets, the excavator shall provide temporary gravel surfaces or cold mulch in good condition immediately after backfill has been placed, and shall complete permanent repairs on the street, sidewalk, curb, gutter, driveway and other surfaces, within five days from the date of completion of the backfill except for periods:
When permanent paving material is not available.
When weather conditions prevent permanent replacement.
When an extension of time is granted by the superintendent of streets.
Temporary Repair. If temporary repair has been made on paved street with gravel and a permanent repair cannot be made within the time specified above due to any of the above mentioned conditions, then the excavator shall be required to replace the gravel with cold mulch as soon as possible.
RESTORING BITUMINOUS. Concrete or asphalt street surfaces.
Temporary grade surface. Where excavations are made in paved areas, the surface shall be replaced with a temporary gravel surface. The gravel shall be placed deep enough to provide a minimum of six inches below the bottom of the bituminous or concrete surface. Normally, this will require nine inches of gravel for bituminous surfaces, twelve inches of gravel for concrete, and concrete base for asphalt wearing surfaces. The gravel shall be placed in the trench at the time it is backfilled. The temporary gravel surface shall be maintained by blading, sprinkling, rolling, adding gravel, to maintain a safe, uniform surface satisfactory to the inspector until the final surface is laid. Excess material shall be removed from the premises immediately. Material for use on temporary gravel surfaces shall be obtained from sound, tough, durable gravel or rock meeting the following requirements for gradings:

Passing 1 inch sieve - 100%

CONCRETE SURFACES. The sub base for concrete surfaces shall be sprinkled just before placing the concrete. Joints and surfaces shall be made to match the original surfaces. The thickness of concrete shall be equal to the adjacent concrete but in no case less than six inches thick. The mixing, cement, water content, proportion, placement, and curing of the concrete will be approved by the superintendent of streets. In no case shall the concrete have less compressive strength than 3,000 pounds per square inch at the end of 28 days.
CONCRETE BASE, BITUMINOUS WEARING SURFACES. This type of surfacing shall be constructed as above described.
GRAVEL SURFACES. Trenches excavated through gravel surfaced area, such as gravel roads and shoulders and unpaved driveways, shall have the gravel restored and maintained as described in Part H, except that the gravel shall be a minimum of one inch more than the thickness of the existing gravel.
PROTECTION OF PUBLIC DURING EXCAVATION PROJECT. Excavation operations shall be conducted in such a manner that a minimum amount of interference or interruption of street traffic will result. Inconvenience to residents and businesses fronting on public streets shall be minimized. Suitable, adequate and sufficient barricades shall be available and used where necessary to prevent accidents involving property or persons. Barricades must be in place until all the excavator's equipment is removed from the site and excavation has been backfilled and proper temporary gravel surface is in place. From sunset to sunrise all barricades and excavations must be clearly outlined by acceptable warning lights, lanterns, flares, and other devices. Police and fire departments shall be notified at least 24 hours in advance of any planned excavation requiring street closures or detour.

The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and shall do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along, or across the work. In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or apparatus should be damaged (and for this purpose pipe coating or other encasement or devices are considered as part of a substructure), they shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them, but the utility owner shall be reimbursed for the expense of such repairs by the permittee. It is the intent of this section that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to substructures, and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such substructure damage and such assumption of liability shall be deemed a contractual obligation which the permittee accepts upon acceptance of an excavation permit. The city need not be made a party to any action because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground utilities and protect the same against damage.
JETTING PIPE. Jetting pipe by means of water under pressure, or compressed air, is permitted only when approved by the city.
INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE
In order to insure proper backfill and restoration of surface, the permittee shall deposit a surety bond or cash deposit with the recorder payable to the city, except that a public utility operating or using any of the streets under a franchise form the city will not be required to furnish such bond, providing such franchise obligates the holder thereof to restore the streets and to hold the city harmless in the event of any injury to any person or damage to any property due to negligence of such holder in conducting excavation and restoration operations under such franchise. The required surety bond must be:
With good and sufficient surety.
By a surety company authorized to transact business in the state.

The amount of the surety bond or cash deposit shall be established by resolution and may be changed from time to time.
APPLICATION FOR STREET EXCAVATION PERMIT. It shall be unlawful for any person to break, excavate, tunnel, undermine, or in any manner affect the surface or base of any street or to place, deposit or leave upon any street any earth or any other excavated material obstructing or tending to interfere with the free use of the street, unless such persons shall first have obtained an excavation permit therefor from the recorder. Any public utility regulated by the state of Utah or holding a franchise from the city which in the pursuit of its calling has frequent occasion to open or make excavations in streets, may, upon application, receive a general permit from the city to cover all excavations such utilities may make within the streets of the city. All permits shall be subject to revocation and the city may refuse to issue a permit for failure of the permittee or applicant to abide by the terms and conditions of this section. Excavation permits will not be requested prior to excavation in case of emergency endangering life or property, providing the city is notified as soon as practicable and a permit is applied for upon the next working day following the emergency.
MOTORIZED VEHICLES PROHIBITED IN CITY PARKS AND CITY TRAILS. (Alpine City Ordinance No. 96-07) It shall be unlawful to use any motorized vehicles upon the parks and trails of Alpine City unless the area to be used is clearly posted by the City by sign as open to off-highway vehicle use.

Furthermore, in addition to such payments and penalties, a delinquent customer may be required to make and file a new application and deposit if the previous deposit has theretofore been applied to the payment of delinquent bills. The recorder is hereby authorized and empowered to enforce the payment of all delinquent water charges by an action at law in the name of the city.
TURNING ON WATER AFTER BEING TURNED OFF PROHIBITED. It shall be unlawful for any person, after the water has been turned off from the premises for nonpayment of water charges or other violation of the ordinances, rules, regulations, or resolutions pertaining to the water supply, to turn on or allow the water to be turned on or used without authority from the superintendent or recorder.
SEPARATE CONNECTIONS. It shall be unlawful for two or more families or service users to be supplied from the same service pipe, connection or water meter unless special permission for such combination usage has been granted by the city council and the premises served are owned by the same owner.  In all such cases, a failure on the part of any one of the users to comply with this section shall warrant a withholding of a supply of water through the service connections until compliance or payment has been made, and in any event, the property owner shall be primarily liable to the city for all water services utilized on all such premises. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the power of the city to require separate pipes, connections, or meters at a subsequent time.
UNAUTHORIZED USERS. It shall be unlawful for any water service user to permit any person from other premises or any unauthorized person to use or obtain water services regularly from his premises or water facilities, either outside or inside his premises.
PERIOD FOR VISITORS. Individuals visiting the premises of an authorized user in a recreational vehicle not including a mobile home and continuing to live therein during the period of visitation may receive water service from the service pipes or facilities of the host during the visitation period which shall not exceed ______ month(s).  Continued use thereafter shall be deemed unauthorized and violative of the provisions of this section relating to separate connections and unauthorized use.
PIPES TO BE KEPT IN GOOD REPAIR. All users of water services shall keep their service pipes and connections and other apparatus in good repair and protected from frost at their own expense. No person except under the direction of the water superintendent shall be allowed to dig into the street for the purpose of laying, removing or repairing any service pipe.
QUALITY OF SERVICE PIPE
All service and other pipe used in conjunction with the water services of the city shall be of such material, quality, and specifications as the city council may from time to time by resolution provide, and shall be installed at such distances below ground as may be specified by regulations relating to the water department. All work, alterations, or extensions affecting water pipes shall be subject to the acceptance of the water superintendent, and no connections with any water mains shall be made without first obtaining a permit therefor from the recorder.
No consumer shall be permitted to conduct water pipes across lots or buildings to adjoining premises without permission from the water superintendent and subject to such requirements relating to controls as may be imposed by him.

This section shall not be construed to extend the liability of the city beyond that provided in the Governmental Immunity Act.
WATER NOT SUPPLIED FOR MOTORS, SYPHONS, ETC.  No water shall be supplied from the pipes of the city water system for the purpose of driving motor, siphon, turbine, or other wheels, or any hydraulic engines, or elevators, or for driving or propelling machinery of any kind whatsoever, nor shall any license be granted or issued for any such purpose except by special permission of the city council.
SPRINKLERS
It shall be unlawful for any person to use such number of outlets simultaneously or to use such sprinkler or combinations of sprinkler or outlets as will in the opinion of the city council materially affect the pressure or supply of water in the city water system or any part thereof, and the city council may from time to time, by resolution, specify combinations or numbers of outlets which may have such effect.
The city council shall, after determining that such improper use exists, notify the affected water user or the owner of the premises whereon such use occurs of such determination in writing, order such use discontinued and advise that such continued usage constitutes a violation of this section.
SCARCITY OF WATER. In time of scarcity of water, whenever it shall in the judgment of the mayor and the city council be necessary, the mayor shall by proclamation limit the use of water to such extent as may be necessary. It shall be unlawful for any person, his family, servants, or agents, to violate any proclamation made by the mayor in pursuance of this section.
WASTE OF WATER
Users of water from the city water system shall not permit water to continue to run wastefully and without due efforts to conserve water. If, in the judgment of the water superintendent or of any of the officers of the city, a user of city water engages in practices which result in the needless waste of water and continues so to do after reasonable notice to discontinue wastefulness has been given, the superintendent or any officer may refer the matter to the city council.
The city council may thereupon consider terminating the right of the individual to use culinary water. If it elects to consider the matter of termination, it shall give notice to the water user of the intention to terminate his water connection at least five days prior to the meeting of the city council at which termination of water service is to be considered. The notice shall inform him of the time and place of the meeting and of the charges which lead to the consideration of the termination.
A water user whose right to utilize city water is being reviewed shall have opportunity to appear with or without counsel and present his reasons why his water service should not be discontinued.
After due hearing, the city council may arrive at a determination. If the determination is to discontinue the wasteful water user's service connection, it shall notify him of the decision and of the period during which the service will remain discontinued.
WATER METERS
Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this section, all structures, dwelling units, establishments and persons using water from the city water system must have such number of water meters connected to their water system as are necessary in the judgment of the superintendent to adequately measure use and determine water charges to the respective users.
Meters will be furnished by the city upon application for a connection, and upon payment of such connection fees and other costs as may be established by the city council from time to time by resolution.
Meters shall be deemed to be and remain the property of the city.  Whenever a dispute between superintendent and the property owner arises as to the appropriate number of meters to be installed on any premises, the matter shall be heard and determined by the city council after due notice in writing to the parties involved.
The superintendent shall cause meter readings to be taken regularly and shall advise the recorder thereof for the purpose of recording the necessary billings for water service.
Meters may be checked, inspected or adjusted at the discretion of the city, and they shall not be adjusted or tampered with by the customer. Meter boxes shall not be opened for the purpose of turning on or off the water except by an authorized representative of the city unless special permission is given by the city through its representatives to the customer to do so.
If a customer submits a written request to the superintendent to test his water meter, the city may, if under the circumstances it deems it advisable and in its discretion, order a test of the meter measuring the water delivered to such customer. If such request is made within twelve months after the date of the last previous test, the customer may be required to pay the cost of such test. If the meter is found in such test to record from 97% to 103% of accuracy under methods of testing satisfactory to the city council, the meter shall be deemed to accurately measure the use of water.
If the city's meters fail to register at any time, the water delivered during the period of failure shall be estimated on the basis of previous consumption during a period which is not questioned. In the event a meter is found to be recording less than 97% or more than 103% of accuracy, the city shall make such adjustments in the customer's previous bills as are just and fair under the circumstances.
All damages or injury to the lines, meters or other materials of the city on or near the customer's premises caused by any act or neglect of the customer shall in the discretion of the city be repaired by and at the expense of the customer, and the customer shall pay all costs and expenses, including a reasonable attorney fee, which may arise or accrue to the city through its efforts to repair the damage to the lines, meters or to other equipment of the department or collect such costs from the customer.
PERMITS FOR INSTALLATION. It shall be unlawful for any person to lay, repair, alter or connect any water line to the city culinary water system without first having received a construction permit from the office of the recorder or from the water superintendent.
APPLICATIONS FOR INSTALLATION PERMIT
Applications for permits to make water connections or other alteration or for laying or repairing lines connected directly or indirectly to the city water system must be made in writing by a licensed plumber, his authorized agent, or by the owner of the premises who shall describe the nature or the work to be done for which the application is made. The application shall be granted if the superintendent determines that:

The connection conforms to the ordinances, regulations, specifications and standards of materials required by the city. All connections, alterations or installations shall be to the line and grade designated by the water superintendent.
Fees for permits or for inspection services shall be of such amounts as the city council shall from time to time determine by resolution.
MOVING OR REPLACEMENT OF WATER LINES. In the event that the city in its sole discretion determines that any water line of the city must be moved or replaced, the city shall bear that portion of the cost of such move or replacement which applies to main lines up to the property line of the customer. The cost of reconnecting such new line or lines from the house of the customer to his property line shall be borne by the customer.
WHEN PERMITS SHALL NOT BE ISSUED. Permission to connect with the city water system shall not be given unless the plumbing in the house or building to be connected meets the provisions of the building and plumbing codes of the city.
DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE. Any customer desiring to discontinue service shall notify the city in writing of such fact at least ten days before the date when such service shall be discontinued. On giving such written notice, the customer shall not be responsible for water bills incurred after the date specified in the notice. Any credit balance in favor of the customer as a result of an advance payment of bills or a deposit will be refunded upon discontinuance of service.
FIRE HYDRANTS. Water for fire hydrants will be furnished free of charge by the city.  Installation and repairs on such hydrants shall be at the expense of the city and shall be made under the direction of the city.

Water Purveyor’s System shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system: and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the purveyor, up to the point where the consumer’s system begins.
The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system.
The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer’s system.
The customer’s system shall include these parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the water purveyor’s distribution system that are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
POLICY
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by Alpine City laws and regulations and this Cross Control Ordinance. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow-prevention assembly required by this Cross Control Ordinance is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
The consumer’s system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of Alpine City to determine whether unprotected cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations exist. When such a condition becomes known, the Public Works Director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition in conformance with Alpine City statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
An approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer’s water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:
In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as a additional source by the Public Works Director, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard.
In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality.
In the case of premises having (1) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line.
The type of protective assembly required under Parts E,3,a, b, and c shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows:
In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in Part E,3,a and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly.
In the case of the premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.
In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants. 
In the case of any premises where there are unprotected cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principal backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection.
In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete inplant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly on each service to the premises.
Any backflow-prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the Public Works Director. The term “Approve Backflow-Prevention Assembly” shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association titled:

AWWA C510-89 - Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow-Prevention Assembly;

AWWA C511-89 - Standard for Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow-Prevention Assemblies;

and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of South California (USCFCCCHR) established in:

University Park
Los Angeles, CA 90089

Testing laboratories, other than the laboratory listed above, will be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the Public Works Director.

Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or back siphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory’s current list of approved backflow-prevention assemblies may be used without further testing or qualification.

It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have a field test performed by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation and at least once per year. In those instances where the Public Works Director deems the hazard to be great enough, he may require field tests at more frequent intervals. These tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by Alpine City personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the Public Works Director. It shall be the duty of the Public Works Director to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the Public Works Director in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that an official representative may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the consumer whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the Public Works Director.
All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under Part E,6, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the Public Works Director is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the Public Works Director finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.  
The Public Works Director is authorized to make all necessary and reasonable rules and policies with respect to the enforcement of this ordinance. All such rules and polices shall be consistent with the provisions of this ordinance and shall be effective immediately after being filed with the City Recorder of Alpine City.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION. The Federal Government has established, through its Clean Water Act, environmental protection regulations for water quality and National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit (NPDES/UPDES) requirements for the City's discharge of its storm water into receiving waters.
PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this ordinance to:
Provide and maintain a storm water system for handling storm water runoff.
Protect, maintain, and enhance the environment of Alpine City.
Provide fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory rates and charges for a storm water system and related services which will generate sufficient revenue for operating, improving and maintaining the storm water sewer utility at a level commensurate with storm water management needs. The rates and charges shall be set by considering needed revenues and the amount of impervious surface on developed parcels and the respective storm water runoff characteristic of the parcel, and apply said rates and charges for the same class of customers.
Establish a policy that present and future rates and charges for this service should be fixed with consideration of the differences in cost fairly allocated to the various customers based upon such factors as the intensity of development of the parcel; the types of development on the parcel; the cost of maintenance, operation, repair and improvements of the various parts of the utility; the quantity and quality of the runoff generated; and other factors which present a reasonable basis for distinction and which will allow for management of the storm drainage system in a manner that protects the public health, safety and welfare.
Establish responsibilities for controlling and managing storm water runoff.
Protect the public health, safety and the general welfare of the citizens of the city, by controlling discharges of pollutants to the city’s stormwater system and to maintain and improve the quality of the receiving waters into which the stormwater outfalls flow, including, without limitation, lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, wetlands, and groundwater of the city.
Enable the City to comply with the UPDES permit and applicable regulations, 40 CFR Section 122.26 for stormwater discharges.
Allow the City to exercise the powers granted by Utah Code , which provides that, among other powers municipalities have with respect to stormwater facilities, is the power by ordinance or resolution to: 
Exercise general regulation over the planning, location, construction, and operation and maintenance of stormwater facilities in the municipality, whether or not owned and operated by the municipality;
Adopt any rules and regulations deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of this statute, including the adoption of a system of fees for services and permits;
Establish standards to regulate the quantity of stormwater discharged and to regulate stormwater contaminants as may be necessary to protect water quality;
Review and approve plans and plats for stormwater management in proposed subdivisions or commercial developments;
Issue permits for stormwater discharges, or for the construction, alteration, extension, or repair of stormwater facilities;
Suspend or revoke permits when it is determined that the permittee has violated any applicable ordinance, resolution, or condition of the permit;
Regulate and prohibit discharges into stormwater facilities of sanitary, industrial, or commercial sewage or waters that have otherwise been contaminated; and

14.08.030 STORMWATER SEWER UTILITY
POTENTIAL HAZARDS DECLARED. Absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation and control, existing storm water drainage conditions within the city constitute a potential hazard to the health, safety, welfare and property of the city inhabitants. All manmade stormwater facilities and conveyances, and natural storm water drainage within the city limits, except those included under authorization issued to counties by state law for management of certain storm water runoff, constitutes the City's storm water sewer system.
STORMWATER SEWER UTILITY ESTABLISHED. There is created and established a storm water sewer utility to be known as the storm water sewer utility.
UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND. There is created the Storm Water Utility Enterprise Fund. All funds received from such storm water services charges shall be placed in the enterprise fund. The collection, accounting and expenditure of all storm water sewer utility funds shall be in accordance with the existing fiscal policy of the City.
SYSTEM OF RATES AND CHARGES. There are hereby imposed storm sewer service fee rates and charges on each parcel of real property within the City. The charges shall fund the administration, planning, design, construction, water quality programming, operation, maintenance and repair of existing and future storm water facilities. 
METHOD OF DETERMINING CONTRIBUTION OF STORMWATER. The method of determining contributions of stormwater shall be in accordance with the City’s currently adopted Consolidated Fee Schedule.
EXEMPTIONS AND CREDITS. Credit for on-site mitigation: A service charge credit shall be available for those non-single family residential customers that exceed the City’s storm water development standards and/or reduce the City’s downstream costs in providing storm water capacity, provided that, if the City’s standards are increased in the future, then only those customers who currently exceed the existing standards will continue to be eligible for a service charge credit. If a request for mitigation credit is granted, the credit shall be applied to all charges from the time of the credit request being accepted by the City, and will be reflected on the next billing thirty days after appeal is granted.

Storm water control facilities located on a parcel may either hold runoff for a period of time and release it at a controlled rate to the storm sewer system (detention), or hold water until it evaporates or infiltrates into the ground (retention). 

Credit for improving quality of storm water runoff will be based on implementation of source or treatment controls which reduce or eliminate pollutants from its storm water runoff before it enters the City storm sewer system.

Customers who believe their site conditions warrant a service charge credit may make application to the City by requesting an application package from the City Engineer or his designee, provided that no credit for detention systems shall exceed a 50% reduction of the original service charge amount and no credit for retention systems shall exceed a 90% reduction of the original service charge amount. In no case shall a customer pay less than the minimum rate for one ERU as specified in the currently adopted Consolidated Fee Schedule.

BILLING AND COLLECTION
Billing. The department of public utilities shall cause billings for storm water sewer utility services to be rendered periodically to the person who is the owner of the parcel, or the owner’s agent, who has signed for water and sanitary sewer service to the parcel. The amounts to be billed shall be included on the existing department of public utilities bill as a separate line item. A storm water-only billing will be sent to those persons who are owners of parcels within the City, but not currently City utility customers. The amount billed shall be in accordance with the current adopted City Fee Schedule. 
Collection. Collections shall be in accordance with the currently adopted collections policy. 
APPEAL OF CHARGES
Any owner or person who considers the City’s storm water charge applied to their parcel to be inaccurate, or who otherwise disagrees with the utility rate determinations, may apply to the director for a service charge adjustment. Such a request shall be in writing and state the grounds of such an appeal. The director shall review the case file and determine whether an error was made in the calculation or application of the fee and make an adjustment to the charge, if necessary, to provide for proper application of the City’s rates and charges pursuant hereto. In all cases, the decision of the director shall be final unless appealed.
Any appeal under this chapter shall be filed in writing with the director no later than twenty (20) days after said billing. Any subsequent appeal shall be brought within twenty (20) days after the date of the appealed decision.
Appeal of decisions made by the director may be brought before the City Council, who may reevaluate the issue raised in the appeal. Decisions of the City Council shall be final and conclusive.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant a right to judicial review which does not otherwise exist at law.

STORMWATER DESIGN AND BMP MANUALS
Adoption. The municipality adopts as its stormwater design and best management practices (BMP) manuals the following publications, which are incorporated by reference in this ordinance as is fully set out herein:
Alpine City Storm Water Drainage Design Manual.
Alpine City Storm Drain Master Plan. 
Alpine City StormWater Management Plan 
These manuals reference a list of acceptable BMPs and include specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manuals may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the governing body of the City, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local maintenance experience. Stormwater facilities that are designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. Unless granted a waiver or judged by the City Engineer to be exempt, the following post construction performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites:
Design of storm drain systems in boundaries and discharges into an Alpine City storm drain system requires direct supervision of a Utah registered professional engineer, and shall carry the seal of the same supervising professional engineer.
All site designs shall control the peak flow rates and total volume of stormwater discharge associated with design storms specified in this ordinance or in the BMP manuals and reduce the generation of post construction stormwater runoff to pre-construction levels. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP manuals.
Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., cold water fisheries, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. 
Stormwater discharges from “hot spots” may require the application of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land disturbance permits shall consult with the City Engineer to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. 
The calculations for determining peak flows and total volume as found in the BMP manuals shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities.
MINIMUM CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
Storm water discharge during all construction activities shall comply with the terms of the Land Disturbance Permit, the StormWater Design Standards and Regulations, and/or requirements set forth by the building Code, and the State of Utah UPDES requirements.
Stormwater designs shall meet the storage requirements as identified in the Storm Water Drainage Design Manual unless the City Engineer has granted the applicant a full or partial waiver for a particular BMP under MCA 14.08.090.
Runoff rates from one lot to another may not exceed pre-existing conditions or in such a manner that may unreasonably and unnecessarily cause more harm than formerly.
If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City Engineer may impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS. Property owners are responsible to manage stormwater runoff and sediment whether in conduit systems or on the surface that traverse or originate on their property, unless this responsibility is relinquished through the terms and conditions of an easement. The stormwater management plan shall include sufficient information to allow the City Engineer to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. To accomplish this goal the stormwater management plan shall include the following:
Topographic Base Map: A 1" = 500” topographic base map of the site which extends a minimum of 1000 feet beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicates:
Existing surface water drainage including streams, ponds, culverts, ditches, sink holes, wetlands; and the type, size, elevation, etc., of nearest upstream and downstream drainage structures; 
Current land use including all existing structures, locations of utilities, roads, and easements; 
All other existing significant natural and artificial features;
Proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities, roads and easements; the limits of clearing and grading; 
Proposed structural BMPs;
A written description of the site plan and justification of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required.
Calculations: Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the pre-development and post-development conditions for the design storms specified in the Storm Water Drainage Design Manual. These calculations must show that the proposed stormwater management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in compliance with this ordinance and the guidelines of the BMP manuals. Such calculations shall include:
A description of the design storm frequency, duration, and intensity where applicable;
Time of concentration; 
Soil curve numbers or runoff coefficients including assumed soil moisture conditions; 
Peak runoff rates and total runoff volumes for each watershed area;
Infiltration rates, where applicable;
Culvert, stormwater sewer, ditch and/or other stormwater conveyance capacities;
Flow velocities; 
Data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff for the design storms referenced in the Storm Water Drainage Design Manual; and 
Documentation of sources for all computation methods and field test results.
Soils Information. If a stormwater management control measure depends on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles and soil survey reports. The number and location of required soil borings or soil pits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the control measure. 
Maintenance and Repair Plan. The design and planning of all stormwater management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued performance. These plans will identify the parts or components of a stormwater management facility that need to be maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary. Provisions for the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan. A permanent elevation benchmark shall be identified in the plans to assist in the periodic inspection of the facility. 
Landscaping Plan. The applicant must present a detailed plan for management of vegetation at the site after construction is finished, including who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. Where it is required by the BMP, this plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect licensed in Utah.
MAINTENANCE EASMENTS. The applicant must ensure access to the site for the purpose of inspection and repair by securing all the maintenance easements needed. These easements must be binding on the current property owner and all subsequent owners of the property and must be properly recorded in the land record.
MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT. The owner of property to be served by an on-site stormwater management facility must execute an inspection and maintenance agreement that shall operate as a deed restriction binding on the current property owner and all subsequent property owners. The maintenance agreement shall:
Assign responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the stormwater facility to the owner of the property upon which the facility is located and be recorded as such on the plat for the property by appropriate notation.
Provide for a periodic inspection by the property owner for the purpose of documenting maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the purpose and requirements of this ordinance.

HISTORY
Amended by Ord. 2016-17 on 8/23/2016
14.08.070 FINDINGS ON STORMWATER RUNOFF HARM
The City Council  has determined that the City's physical growth and urban development has and  will continue to increase the amount of stormwater runoff collected and routed,  using the City's stormwater drainage system and facilities. The City Council  finds that the stormwater runoff causes property damage and erosion, carries  concentration of nutrients, chemicals, heavy metals, oil and toxic materials into  receiving waters and ground waters; degrades the integrity of City streets, curbs,  gutters and other infrastructure conveying stormwater; reduces the citizens' access  to emergency services and imposes hazards to both life and property.  Additionally, the Federal Government has established, through its Clean Water  Act, environmental protection regulations for water quality and NPDES permit  requirement for the City's discharge of its stormwater into receiving waters.

PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES: In view of the foregoing, the purposes  and objectives of this Chapter are to:
Provide and maintain a stormwater system for handling stormwater  runoff;
Provide fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory rates and charges for a stormwater system and related services which will generate sufficient revenue  for operating, improving and maintaining the stormwater sewer utility at a  level commensurate with stormwater management needs. The rates and  charges shall be set by considering needed revenues and the amount of  impervious surface on developed parcels and the respective stormwater  runoff characteristic of the parcel, and apply said rates and charges for the  same class of customers; and
Establish a policy that present and future rates and charges for this service  should be fixed with consideration of the differences in cost fairly  allocated to the various customers based upon such factors as the intensity  of development of the parcel; the types of development on the parcel; the  cost of maintenance, operation, repair and improvements of the various  parts of the utility; the quantity and quality of the runoff generated; and  other factors which present a reasonable basis for distinction and which  will allow for management of the storm drainage system in a manner that  protects the public health, safety and welfare. 
METHOD OF DETERMINING CONTRIBUTION OF STORMWATER:
Contributions of stormwater from nonresidential properties and  residential properties larger than four-plexes have been determined  through aerial photography, records of the City, records of the County  Recorder's Office and land surface evaluation and measurement of the  number of square feet of impervious surface.
Contributions of stormwater from residential parcels up to and including  four-plexes have been determined through a statistically significant sample  of impervious areas within these classifications.
DEFINITIONS: For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms,  phrases and words shall have the following meanings:
"City" means Alpine City.
"Council" means the City Council.
"Customer" or "person" means any individual public; public or private  corporation and its officers; partnership; association; firm; trustee;  executor of an estate; the State or its departments, institutions, bureaus,  agencies, county; city; political subdivision; or any other governmental or  legal entity recognized by law.
"Developed parcel" means any parcel, which has been altered by grading  or filling of the ground surface, or construction of any improvements or  other impervious surface area thereon.
"Director" means the director of the department of public works or the  director's designee.
"Equivalent residential unit (ERU)" means a configuration of  development, or impervious surfaces on a parcel, contributing runoff to the  city's stormwater drainage system or which represents the estimated use of  the system that is approximately equal to that contributed by a single- family residential parcel. A single-family residential parcel has been  determined to contain an average of two thousand five hundred square feet  of impervious surfaces. One ERU is equal to two thousand five hundred  square feet of impervious surface area.
"Non-polluted" when used in connection with water or any other  referenced medium, means that medium shall not have been contaminated  with a pollutant.
"Parcel" means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land, with  person or persons identified as owner(s); having boundaries and surface  area, which is documented and given a property number by Utah County.
"National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) StormWater  Regulations" means the provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act  establishing specific permit requirements for the control of stormwater  discharges.
"Single-family residential parcel" means any parcel of land which is  improved with a dwelling unit.
"Stormwater" means water produced by storms, surface drainage, snow an  ice melt, spring flows, groundwater and other water handled by the stormwater sewer system.
"Stormwater facilities" means any facility, improvement, development,  property or interest therein made, constructed or acquired for the purposes  of controlling stormwater quantity and quality. 
"Stormwater sewer system" means the city stormwater system comprised  of stormwater facilities, streets and any other features which store,  control, treat and/or convey stormwater.
"Stormwater sewer utility" or "utility" means the utility created through  this chapter which maintains, regulates and improves stormwater facilities  and programs within Alpine City.
"Undeveloped parcel" means any parcel which has not been altered by  grading or filling of the ground surface, or by construction of any  improvements or other impervious surface area which affected the  hydraulic properties of the parcel.
POTENTIAL HAZARDS DECLARED. The City Council finds and declares  that absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation and control, existing  stormwater drainage conditions within the city constitute a potential hazard to the  health, safety, welfare and property of the city inhabitants. All manmade stormwater facilities and conveyances, and natural stormwater drainage within the city  limits, except those included under authorization issued to counties by state law  for management of certain stormwater runoff constitutes the city's stormwater  sewer system.
STORMWATER SEWER UTILITY CREATED RESPONSIBILITIES.  There is created and established a stormwater sewer utility to be known as a  stormwater sewer utility.
OWNERSHIP OF CITY STORMWATER FACILITIES AND ASSETS. The city's storm sewer assets to be transferred to the utility shall be determined by  the mayor, or the mayor's designee, and transferred to the utility. Until such  transfer, the utility shall operate, maintain and improve all city storm sewer  facilities used for the conveyance of stormwaters, through, under or over lands,  watercourses beginning at a point where the stormwaters first enter the storm sewer system of the city and ending in each instance at a point where the storwater exit from the system.
NO POLLUTED WATERS DISCHARGED TO STORM SEWERS. The  only substances dischargeable under this chapter into the city's storm sewer are  stormwater, surface drainage, subsurface drainage, groundwater, roof runoff,  cooling water or non-polluted water. Such waters may be discharged only into  storm sewers, which have adequate capacity for the accommodation of such  waters. Such discharged water shall comply with the city's stormwater quality  standards.
SYSTEM OF RATES AND CHARGES
There are hereby imposed storm sewer service fee rates and charges on  each parcel of real property within the city. The charges shall fund the  administration, planning, design, construction, water quality programming,  operation, maintenance and repair of existing and future stormwater  facilities.
BILLING AND COLLECTION
BILLING. The department of public utilities shall cause billings for stormwater sewer utility services to be rendered periodically to the person who is the  owner of the parcel, or the owner's agent, who has signed for water and sanitary  sewer service to the parcel. The amounts to be billed shall be included on the  existing department of public utilities bill as a separate line item. A stormwater- only billing will be sent to those persons who are owners of parcels within the  city, but not currently city utility customers. 
Single-family residential and duplex parcels shall constitute one ERU and  are charged $3.30 per month.
All tri-plex and four-plex residential parcels are charged $3.30 per month.
Undeveloped parcels shall have no charges assess against such parcels.
The charge for all other parcels shall be based upon the total square feet of  measured impervious surface divided by four thousand two hundred  square feet or on ERU, and rounded to the nearest whole number. The  actual total monthly service charge shall be computed by multiplying the  ERUs for a parcel by the rate of $3.30 per month. 
COLLECTION
In the event partial payment is made on a combined bill, the payment shall  be applied to each service on a pro rata basis. 
In the event of delinquency, fees and charges levied in accordance  herewith shall be a debt due the city. If this debt is not paid within thirty  days after billing, it shall be deemed delinquent and subject to recovery in  a civil action and/or said department shall have the right to terminate water  and sewer services to the premises. Any uncollected amount due from the  person or persons who own the parcel on any inactive, terminated or  discontinued account may be transferred to any active account under the  same person's or person's name(s) and upon failure to pay such bill after at  least five days' prior written notice, water and other city services to that  account and parcel may be discontinued. 
Restoration of Service. Water sewer, garbage and storm service shall not  be restored until all charges have been paid in full.
Utility Enterprise Fund. There is created the stormwater utility enterprise  fund. All funds received from such stormwater services charges shall be  placed in the enterprise fun and left separate and apart from all other city  funds. The collection, accounting and expenditure of all stormwater  sewer utility funds shall be accordance with the existing fiscal policy of  the city. 
APPEAL OF CHARGES
Any owner or person who considers the city's stormwater charge applied  to their parcel to be inaccurate, or who otherwise disagrees with the utility  rate determinations, may apply to the director for a service charge  adjustment. Such a request shall be in writing and state the grounds of  such an appeal. The director shall review the case file and determine  whether an error was made in the calculation or application of the fee and  make an adjustment to the charge, if necessary, to provide for proper  application of the city's rates and charges pursuant hereto. In all cases, the  decision of the director shall be final unless appealed.
Any appeal under this chapter shall be filed in writing with the director no  later than twenty days after said billing. Any subsequent appeal shall be  brought within twenty days after the date of the appealed decision.
Appeal of decisions made by the director may be brought before the City  Council, who may reevaluate the issue raised in the appeal. Decisions of  the City Council shall be final and conclusive.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant a right to judicial  review which does not otherwise exist at law.

The City Engineer shall have the discretion to adopt provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security or performance bond on the completion of various stages of development. In addition, occupation permits shall not be granted until corrections to all BMP’s have been made and accepted by the City Engineer.
LANDSCAPING AND STABILIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTIAL LOTS. For individual lots in residential construction, final stabilization must be completed within two years of the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. 

“Final stabilization” is achieved when the following conditions are met:
All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed
A uniform (e.g. evenly distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the native background vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures.
For individual lots in residential construction, final stabilization means that either the homebuilder has completed final stabilization as specified above, or the homebuilder has established temporary stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner. The homeowner is obligated, by this ordinance, to complete the requirements for final stabilization within two years.

LANDSCAPING AND STABILIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL OTHER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared by development activities shall be revegetated according to a schedule approved by the City Engineer. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over ninety percent (90%) of the seeded area. 
Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum seventy-five percent (75%) survival for one (1) year is achieved. 
In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved.
INSPECTION OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES. Periodic inspections of facilities shall be performed as provided for in MCA 14.08.060.
RECORDS OF INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation of the stormwater facility, and of all maintenance and repairs to the facility, and shall retain the records for at least 3 years. These records shall be made available to the City Engineer during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request.
FAILURE TO MEET OR MAINTAIN DESIGN OR MAINTENANCE STANDARDS. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the design or maintenance standards required for stormwater facilities under this ordinance, the City Engineer, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the City Engineer shall notify in writing the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have 15 days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner. In the event that corrective action is not undertaken within that time, the City Engineer may take necessary corrective action. The cost of any action by the City Engineer under this section shall be charged to the responsible party.

Preface
In 2018, codification and administration of the Development Code began in- house under the direction of
City Recorder, and with the assistance of Municipal Code Online, Inc. This City Code shall be cited as
the Development Code of Alpine City or “DCA” as its acronym.
Development Code of Alpine City (DCA) comprises three core elements:
? A Code System which provides structure to the Legislation
? The Legislation itself (passed by Ordinance, or Resolution in specific cases)
? The “Legislative History” of the Legislation
1. DCA's Code System maintains a structure by subject matter using a decimal numbering system
that separates title, chapter and section (for example: 1.01.010). This complete set of numbers is
designed to aid in searching, organizing and referencing the Code, and to assist in subsequent
codification as new ordinances are added. Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed
for future use and may also be marked as “Reserved” to ease internal expansion.
a. The first number in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the title level.
b. The second series in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the chapter level.
c. The third series in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the section level.
d. If there is a fourth series in the sequence, it may designate a subsection level.
2. DCA's Legislation is passed by Ordinance. Legislations may contain an unordered list (using
bullets, discs, squares, etc.), or an alphanumeric ordered list 1, a, i, (1), (A), (a) arranged to show
hierarchical relationships.
3. Legislative History beneath each legislation identifies the specific legal sources of a section.
The Development Code is supplemented from time to time with amendments and additions made by
Alpine City. The specific legal sources that comprise this Code have been adapted during the
codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies
between the online Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal Code
Online, Inc., provides a searchable database of the Code for easy reference and convenience.
NOTICE: THIS CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF
LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN
THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ONLINE CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE
ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER
REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT THE CITY RECORDER.

the Zoning Administrator and with the Land Use Hearing Officer a written notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof.

to the person or entity filing the appeal at least one week before the date of the
hearing.
iii. All appeals on decisions applying a land use regulation to a specific application or
parcel of land shall be on the record only and not de novo. In appeals from
decisions applying the terms of the land use regulation the Hearing Officer shall
review the record, and may not accept or consider any evidence outside the
record unless the Zoning Administrator fails to provide a record of proceeding.
iv. The Hearing Officer shall conduct a hearing on each appeal with respect for the
due process rights of each of the participants. Notice shall be given of all hearing
dates and times. Parties shall be given the right to be heard and present
argument. Parties shall be allowed to offer written and oral argument as they
desire, in conformance with reasonable rules for such procedure adopted by the
Hearing Officer.
v. The Land Use Hearing Officer shall review the decision of the Land Use Authority
that involves a determination of factual matters on the record, and not de novo,
and determine whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or illegal. A decision

there was not substantial evidence, as that term has been defined by Utah courts,
found in the record to support each essential finding of fact of the Land Use
Authority.
vi. The Land Use Hearing Officer shall interpret and apply the plain meaning of the
land use regulation; and interpret and apply a land use regulation to favor a land
use application unless the land use regulation plainly restricts the land use
application.

Hearing Officer may affirm, reverse, or remand to the appropriate Land Use
Authority for further review and consideration the action taken by the Land Use
Authority.
f. The appellant has the burden of proving that the Land Use Authority erred.
g. The Hearing Officer shall presume that the decision of the Land Use Authority that is
being appealed is correct, and shall only modify the decision if the appellant meets its
burden of showing that the Land Use Authority erred in its application or interpretation of
the land use ordinances.
h. Only decisions applying and interpreting the adopted land use ordinances of the City or
requesting reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities may be appealed to
the Hearing Officer. A person may not appeal, and the Hearing Officer, in his/her duties
as an Appeal Authority, may not consider, any appeal of a legislative decision of the City
Council, such as a decision to adopt or amend any land use (zoning or subdivision)
ordinance of the City.

regulation or ordinance, except as specifically allowed by the land use regulation or
ordinance.
j. The Hearing Officer shall render his/her decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days
from the date that the hearing is held. The Officer may affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination of the Land Use Authority.
k. A decision of the Hearing Officer takes effect on the date when the Officer issues a
written decision, or as otherwise provided by ordinance. A written decision, or other event
as provided by ordinance, constitutes a final decision under Subsection 10-9a-802(2)(a)
or a final action under Subsection 10-9a-801(4) of the Utah State Code.

issues that are the subject of the request for arbitration filed with the private
property ombudsman by a property owner.

under Part 3,a to file a petition has expired does not affect the time to file a
petition.

court the record of its proceedings including its minutes, findings, orders, and if available,
a true and correct transcript of its proceedings.

a constitutional taking issue is filed under Utah Code Annotated 13-43-204, the
petitioner may seek an injunction from the district court staying the Land Use

The CR-40,000 Zone includes the territory, generally located around the periphery of the City, considered appropriate for low
density residential development. While much of the land is presently used for agriculture, or is vacant or wildland, the zone does
contain several single-unit dwellings on large lots (one acre or larger). Also included in the zone are those areas which as a result
of the presence of steep slope, adverse soil characteristics, flood hazard, mudflow or earthquake potential, wildfire hazard or
similar critical and sensitive natural conditions are considered environmentally fragile.
It is hereby declared to be the intent and purpose of the City Council in establishing the CR- 40,000 Zone:
1. To delineate environmentally sensitive areas within the City and to establish standards and guidelines for the uses and
development activities occurring therein which recognize and appropriately balance:
a. the need for the preservation of the natural environmental conditions,
b. the need for mitigation of potentially adverse or unsafe conditions arising from development activities,
c. the protection of the interests of subsequent purchasers and occupants, and
d. the rights of owners to the reasonable use of their property.
2. To avoid or mitigate the effect of natural hazards from earthquakes, landslides, floods, fires and similar calamities and to
reduce the potential for subsequent public involvement or expenditure in mitigation of such adverse or unsafe conditions
occurring as a result of the disruption of natural conditions by development activity.
3. To protect and conserve the culinary water supply, sensitive vegetation, soil, wildlife habitat and other natural resources
within the area.
4. To facilitate and encourage the location, design, and construction of uses, development projects and building sites in the
zone area which provide maximum safety and human enjoyment consistent with the natural limitations and the need for
protection of the environment.
5. To preserve the aesthetic appearance of the landscape. Because of the fragile nature of the land in this zone, special
conditions and requirements are attached to developments occurring therein to more effectively promote the purposes
stated above and to mitigate the potential adverse aspects of developments in the area. The requirements hereinafter set
forth are considered the minimum necessary to accomplishments of the purpose and intent in establishing this zone.

The CE-5 Zone consists primarily of the more mountainous areas of the City which, because of the presence of steep slopes,
unique soil characteristics, wild fire hazard or similar natural condition are considered environmentally sensitive.
It is the intent and purpose of the City Council in establishing the zone to set minimum standards for the use of land within the zone
and to establish guidelines for development activities thereon which recognize and balance the following:
1. The need to preserve sensitive environmental conditions;
2. The need to mitigate potentially unsafe conditions in the area and prevent development that might increase hazards due to
such conditions;
3. The rights of property owners to the reasonable use and enjoyment of their land; and,
4. The need to preserve a healthy, safe and aesthetic living environment for occupants of the zone and the surrounding
community.
It is anticipated that uses in the zone will be limited to one-family dwellings in naturalistic settings with associated personal uses
and structures. Such uses will be permitted in those portions of the zone which are most suitable for development activity (Dwelling
Cluster areas) interspersed with large and undisturbed open space areas.

3.06.010 Legislative Intent And Public Purpose
1. The CE-50 Zone consists primarily of the more mountainous areas of the City which are considered environmentally
sensitive because of the presence of steep slopes, unique soil and vegetative characteristics, mountain water courses, or
similar natural conditions. Land within the zone has historically been the location of wildfire, floods, rock falls, landslides, soil
erosion and other natural hazards. Much of the zone forms the recharge area for culinary aquifers, and critical winter range
essential to wildlife. Of high importance is maintaining the scenic quality of the mountain areas. This encompasses all future
annexation areas above an elevation of 5350 feet and other lands as designated by the City Council.
2. It is the intent and purpose of the City Council in establishing the zone to set minimum standards for the use of land within
the zone and to establish guidelines for development activities thereon which recognize and balance the following:
a. The need to preserve sensitive environmental conditions;
b. The need to mitigate potentially unsafe conditions in the area and prevent development that might increase hazards
due to such conditions;
c. The rights of property owners to the reasonable use and enjoyment of their land; and
d. The need to preserve a healthy, safe and aesthetic living environment for occupants of the zone and the surrounding
community.
It is anticipated that uses in the zone will be limited to single-family dwellings in naturalistic settings with associated personal
uses and structures. Such uses will be permitted in those portions of the zone which are most suitable for development
activity (housing placement) interspersed with large and undisturbed open space areas.
(Ord. 98-23,11-24-98)

territory is placed into the CE-50 Zone, or a lot within a Planned Residential Development, in either case, subject to
compliance with the applicable conditions within the zone and approval of a site plan by the Planning Commission.
2. Planned Residential Developments (PRD), subject to compliance with the provisions of DCA 3.09.
3. Water, sewer and utility transmission lines and facilities required as an incidental part of development within the zone, and
subject to the approval of a site plan by the Planning Commission.
4. Motor vehicle roads and rights-of-way subject to compliance with City standards for design and construction for such uses
and upon approval of a site plan by the Planning Commission.
5. Home Occupations, subject to the provisions of DCA 3.23.070 Part 3.
6. Accessory Apartments, subject to the applicable provisions of DCA 3.23.070 Part 1.

e. do all the above in a manner which is consistent with the objectives of the underlying
zone and under conditions which will result in the creation of residential environments of sustained desirability.
2. To establish criteria and standards for the design of PRD projects by developers and also guidelines for evaluation by the
City. It shall be the City’s sole discretion to decide if a project should be a PRD within the intent of the ordinance as noted
above. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council and the City Council shall make the
final decision in deciding whether a project should be a PRD prior to a concept approval being given.
3. To set forth the duties and responsibilities of developers and residents with respect to the approval, construction, and
maintenance of such projects.
4. To clearly establish the relationship of the City and the developer with respect to the review and approval of such projects.
5. PRDs are permitted only in the CR-20,000, CR-40,000, CE-5, and CE-50 zones.

3. Bonus Density. A bonus density may be granted by the City Council to a PRD project subject to the prior recommendation
of the Planning Commission and a finding that the density bonus is justified. The maximum bonus density eligible for award
for a specific project shall be as set forth in the following schedule. The cumulative maximum bonus amount shall not
exceed the percentages shown in the public open space column in the following schedule.
Maximum Bonus Amount
Zone District Percentage of Base Density
Public Open Space Private Open Space
CR-20,000 20% 10%
CR-40,000 25% 10%
CE-5 30% 10%
CE-50 0% 0%
a. Natural Open Space Bonus Density. Any award of bonus density for natural open space shall be as determined by
the City in accordance with the following density bonus criteria.
By providing additional natural open space in excess of the minimum requirement, a developer may receive 1% of
the base density for each 1% of additional natural open space dedicated. Private open space will receive 50% less
bonus density.
Examples of Bonus Density
25 acres in the CR-20,000 zone with 5% slope and developer donates additional 2.5 acres of natural open space.
Base Density:
To determine the base density, divide 25 (area within slope range) by 0.58 (required area per dwelling unit). Base
Density = 25/0.58 = 43.103. Round to the nearest whole number and base density is 43 lots.
Bonus Density:
If the developer donates 2.5 acres (10% of total acreage) of additional land as natural open space, he will receive a
10% bonus (1% of additional natural open space = 1% of the base density as a bonus). To calculate the bonus
density, multiply 43 lots (base density) by 10% which equals 4.3. Round to the nearest whole number and the bonus
density is 4 lots for a total of 47 lots (43 base density lots + 4 bonus density lots).
25 acres in the CR-40,000 zone with 5% slope and developer donates additional 2.5 acres of natural open space.
Base Density:
To determine the base density, divide 25 (area within slope range) by 1.00 (required area per dwelling unit). Base
Density = 25/1.00 = 25. Base density is 25 lots.
Bonus Density:
If the developer donates 2.5 acres (10% of total acreage) of additional land as natural open space, he will receive a
10% bonus (1% of additional natural open space = 1% of the base density as a bonus). To calculate the bonus
density, multiply 25 lots (base density) by 10% which equals 2.5. Round to the nearest whole number and the bonus
density is 3 lots for a total of 28 lots (25 base density lots + 3 bonus density lots).

b. Developed Open Space Bonus. Developed useable open space shall be determined on a case-by-case basis and
evaluated by the Planning Commission. Development may include one or more of the following or other items as the
Planning Commission may determine: landscaping, including lawns, trees, shrubbery, sprinkler systems, drip
watering systems, etc.; other amenities may include such things as park benches, playground equipment, walking
paths, etc.
By providing additional developed useable open space in excess of the minimum requirement, a developer may
receive 3% of the base density as a bonus for each 1% of additional developed useable open space dedicated.
Private open space will receive 50% less bonus density.
Examples of Developed Open Space Bonus
25 acres in the CR-20,000 zone with 5% slope and developer donates additional 1 acre of developed open space.
Base Density:
To determine the base density, divide 25 (area within slope range) by 0.58 (required area per dwelling unit). Base
Density = 25/0.58 = 43.103. Round to the nearest whole number and the base density is 43 lots.
Bonus Density:
If the developer donates 1 acre (4% of total acreage) of additional developed open space, he will receive a 12%
bonus (for each 1% of additional developed open space, the developer may receive 3% of the base density as a
bonus – 4% extra is being given so 4% x3% = 12%). To calculate the bonus density, multiply 43 lots (base density)
by 12% which equals 5.16. Round to the nearest whole number and the bonus density is 5 lots for a total of 48 lots
(43 base density lots + 5 bonus density lots).
25 acres in the CR-40,000 zone with 5% slope and developer donates additional 1 acre of developed open space.
Base Density:
To determine the base density, divide 25 (area within slope range) by 1.00 (required area per dwelling unit). Base
Density = 25/1.00 = 25. Round to the nearest whole number and the base density is 25 lots.
Bonus Density:
If the developer donates 1 acre (4%of total acreage) of additional land as developed open space, he will receive a
12% bonus (for each 1% of additional developed open space, the developer may receive 3% of the base density as
a bonus – 4% extra is being given so 4% x 3% = 12%). To calculate the bonus density, multiply 25 lots (base
density) by 12% which equals 3. Round to the nearest whole number and the bonus density is 3 lots for a total of 28
lots (25 base density lots + 3 bonus density lots).
The developed open space bonus may be used in conjunction with the natural open space bonus in any combination
up to the maximum bonus allowed.

(5,000) square feet. All dwellings and other habitable structures and accessory buildings shall be located within the
Designated Buildable Area.
a. Each Designated Buildable Area shall conform to the criteria for qualification as a "buildable area" as defined in this
ordinance. Except that the Planning Commission may approve or require the placement of the Designated Buildable
Area in a location within the lot which does not conform to one or more of the criteria for buildable area, upon a
finding that the proposed Designated Buildable Area:
i. will more adequately accommodate subsequent development of the lot,
ii. will not constitute a potential hazard to life or property, and
iii. will serve to diminish the negative impact of subsequent development upon the lot or community (i.e.
extraordinary construction of driveway access, mitigate visual intrusion of structure on ridge line).
b. The location of each Designated Buildable Area shall be designated upon the preliminary plan and shall also be
identified and described on the final recorded plat, together with a notation to the effect that all main and accessory
buildings shall be located within the Designated Buildable Area. Where a Designated Buildable Area is shown on a
lot, the boundary of said area shall constitute the Designated Setback envelope applicable to the lot. Where an
entire lot area qualifies as a Buildable Area no designation on the final plat shall be required.
c. Except as permitted pursuant to Part 3,a, any portion of a lot which has been graded to produce a percent of slope
to qualify under the Buildable Area criteria shall be excluded from consideration as part of the Designated Buildable
Area.
d. The Designated Buildable Area may be amended by the City Planner and City Engineer as long as the minimum
setback requirements of the underlying zone are met. (Ord. 2004-13, 9/28/04)
4. Each dwelling in the project shall be setback from the property line in accordance with the setback lines as shown on the
approved plat (Designated Setback Envelope). The Designated Setback Envelope shall be established in accordance with
the following (setbacks are measured from the property line to the nearest foundation):
a. Front Yard. The minimum front yard setback shall be thirty (30) feet.
b. Side Yard - Corner Lots. On corner lots, the side that faces onto a public street shall be not less than thirty (30) feet.
c. Side Yard – Interior Lots. The minimum side yard setbacks for interior lots shall be an aggregate of thirty (30) feet
with no less than twelve (12) feet on a side.
d. Rear Yard. The minimum rear yard setback shall be thirty (30) feet.
Subject to the prior recommendation of the Planning Commission, the City Council may approve an exception to the
Designated Setback Envelope standards above for one or more lots within a PRD project, upon a finding that such
exception is appropriate for the proper development of the lot and that the exception will not result in the
establishment of a hazardous condition.
Where no designated building envelope is provided, the setbacks shall be the same as the minimum requirements
within the underlying zone.
5. The maximum height of any dwelling or other main building shall be thirty-four (34) feet, as determined in accordance with
the provisions of DCA 3.21.080, (Ord. 96-15, 12/18/96) except in the CE-50 zone the height shall not exceed 25 feet. (See

overlay maps, which identify the approximate areas where the hazard lands are be located. The purpose of this chapter is to
provide for safe, orderly and beneficial development of areas characterized by diversity of sensitive and hazardous conditions as
shown on the Official Sensitive and Hazard Area Maps (flood plain, urban/wildlife, geologic hazards, hillside); to limit alteration to
topography and reduce encroachment upon, or alteration of, such areas. Sensitive land conditions can be considered to include
fire, slope of the land, slope and soil stability, natural drainage ways, flood plains, wetlands, soil characteristics, potential landslide
areas, seismic areas, and other such potential hazards.
(Original Ordinance No. 2002-01. Amended by Ordinance 2005-03, 1/25/05)
3.12.020 Regulations
Any development or change to a parcel of ground, which alters it from its natural state in any way, including clearing, excavation,
grading, installation of any infrastructure or erection of any types of buildings within a sensitive land area as shown on the Alpine
City Sensitive and Hazard Area Maps shall comply with this ordinance. The type of regulations applicable to the land depend upon
the classification in which the land is placed.
(Original Ordinance No. 2002-01. Amended by Ordinance 2005-03, 1/25/05)
3.12.030 Approval
1. If the proposed development is involved in a Site Plan Review, or approval of a planned unit development, conditional use
permit, subdivision, partition, or other regulatory process, the review shall be conducted simultaneously with the regulatory
process and no additional fee shall be charged.
2. If a development is exclusive of any other regulatory process but in a sensitive land area then the Sensitive Land Area
Review may be processed by the City Engineer.
3. Criteria for Approval. An approval shall be issued by Alpine City when the applicant demonstrates the following:
4. That the development is in compliance with the requirements of this Chapter and all other applicable Alpine City
Ordinances.
5. Planning Commission. Shall have the power to amend plans to include any or all of the following conditions if it is deemed
necessary to mitigate any potential impact caused by the development.
If in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the Environmental Impact Study is deficient in any area, or the mitigation plan
is deficient in any way, the Planning Commission may order another study, and the findings of the City study may be used in
determining the safety of the proposed development.
(Original Ordinance No. 2002-01. Amended by Ordinance 2005-03, 1/25/05)
3.12.040 Sensitive Land Classifications
The following factors shall be used to determine the classification of various lands and their constraints to building and
development on them:
1. Geologic Hazard Lands. Lands identified on the Official Alpine City Hazards map as having landslide, debris flow, rock fall,
soil liquefaction or surface-fault-rupture hazards.
2. Hillside Lands. Lands identified on the Official Alpine City Hazard map as having an elevation above 5350 feet Mean Sea
level.
3. Urban/Wildland Lands. Lands identified on the Official Alpine City Hazard map as having potential wild fire hazard.
4. Flood Plain Lands. Lands with potential stream flow and flood hazard. Flood plain lands consist of all lands contained
within the 100-year flood plain as defined by Federal Emergency Management Agency, in Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) #490228005A, dated April 4, 1983. The April 4, 1983 FIRM map is also adopted as the Official Alpine City Hazard
map for flood damage prevention overlay zone.

5. Review of reports—Approval procedure
a. In order to fulfill the purposes of the geologic hazard overlay, the Planning Commission shall review any proposed
land use which requires preparation of a geologic hazard report under this category to determine the possible risks
to the safety of persons or property from geologic hazards.
b. Prior to consideration of any such development for preliminary plat by the City, the geologic hazard report shall be
submitted to Alpine City and Utah State Geological Survey for review and recommendation. Alpine City may request
at the developer’s expense other experts to review the report (third-party review) and provide additional
recommendations. Alpine City shall retain a copy in the Alpine City development file.
c. Alpine City and other retained experts in their review of the report, and the City Council in its consideration of the
development, shall determine whether the development complies with all of the following standards:
i. The proposed land use does not present an unreasonable risk to the safety of persons or property (including
buildings, storm drains, public streets, utilities or critical facilities, whether off-site or on-site), or to the
aesthetics and natural functions of the landscape (e.g. slopes, streams or other waterways, drainage, wildlife
habitat, etc., whether off-site or on-site) because of the presence of geologic hazards or because of
modifications to the site due to the proposed land use;
ii. The proposed land use may be approved if the reports submitted by the applicant demonstrate that,
consistent with the state of the practice, the identified hazards can be mitigated to a level where the risk to
human life and damage to property are reduced to an acceptable and reasonable level in a manner which will
not violate applicable federal, state, or local statutes, ordinances, or regulations. Mitigation measures should
consider, in their design, the intended aesthetic functions of other governing ordinances.
d. Any area determined to contain geologic hazards to life or property shall not be approved for development unless
the applicant demonstrates that the identified hazards or limitations can be reduced to an acceptable and reasonable
manner. The applicant must include, with the geologic hazards report, a mitigation plan that defines how the
identified hazards or limitations will be addressed, as described in Part 4, and without impacting or affecting off-site
areas.
e. Alpine City may set other requirements as are necessary to overcome any geologic hazards and to ensure that the
purposes of this Chapter are met. These requirements may include, but are not limited to:
i. Additional or more detailed studies to understand or quantify the hazard or determine whether mitigation
measures recommended in the report are adequate;
ii. Specific mitigation requirements; establishing buildable and/or non-buildable areas; limitations on slope
grading; and/or revegetation;
iii. Installation of monitoring equipment and seasonal monitoring of surface and subsurface geologic conditions,
including groundwater levels;
iv. Other requirements such as time schedules for completion of the mitigation, phasing of development, etc.
f. Alpine City may also set requirements necessary to reduce the risks from geologic hazards as a condition to the
approval of any development which requires a geologic hazards report.
6. Requirements in Surface Fault Rupture Areas
a. No critical facility (excluding transportation lines or utilities, which by their nature may cross faults) or structures
designed for human occupancy shall be built astride a Holocene fault. A fault study must be prepared prior to final
approval of the land use or applicable building permits. If a fault is discovered in the excavation, a special study must
be performed to determine the activity class of the fault; the procedures set forth in UGS MP 03-6 shall be followed.
If the fault activity class is Holocene, the fault study report shall establish a fault setback on either side of the fault
within which no critical facilities or structures for human occupancy shall be placed. If the fault activity class is Late
Quaternary or Quaternary, recommendations in USC MP 03-06 shall be followed.
b. No structure designed for human occupancy shall be built on a fault scarp. Footing setbacks from a fault scarp shall
be the requirements as recommended in USG MP 03-06 or the slope requirements of the adopted International
Building Code (IBC Appendix J), whichever is more stringent. The Building Official may increase footing setback
requirements where information from a geologic report indicates slope conditions warrant a greater setback
distance.
c. Setback requirements do not apply to accessory buildings.

HISTORY
Amended by Ord. 2019-10 on 5/14/2019
3.12.080 Flood Damage Prevention Overlay
a. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Utah has in Utah Code sections 10-3-701 and 10-8-84
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Alpine City Council does ordain as follows:
b. Findings of Fact
i. The flood hazard areas of Alpine, Utah are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
ii. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an
increase flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
c. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare,
and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
i. Protect human life and health;
ii. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
iii. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
expense of the general public;
iv. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
v. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
vi. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of flood-prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
vii. Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
d. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following
methods:
i. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive
increases in flood heights or velocities;
ii. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive
increases in flood heights or velocities;
iii. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
iv. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are
involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
v. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage.
vi. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.

APEX - means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that
formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING - means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where
velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD - is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary
Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A
usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
BASE FLOOD - means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT - means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE - means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the
flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground
level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii)
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude
of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes
a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a

Rate Map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION - means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new
construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION - means a manufactured home park or subdivision for
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including

camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION - (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal
Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit
was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on
a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings,
piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE - means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above
ground, as well as a manufactured home.

i. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary conditions or
ii. Any alteration of a "historic structure” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a "historic structure."
VARIANCE - is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this ordinance when specific enforcement would
result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise

prohibited by this ordinance. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations).
VIOLATION - means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's
floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or
(e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION - means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of
1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal
or riverine areas.
f. General Provisions
i. Lands to Which This Section Applies. This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of Alpine City, Utah.
ii. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance
Study for Alpine City,” dated September 2, 2016, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood
Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this ordinance.
iii. Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be required to ensure conformance with
the provisions of this ordinance.
iv. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered or have its use changed without full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
v. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance,
easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
vi. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
vii. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare
occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the
part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

g. Administration
i. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer is hereby appointed the Floodplain
Administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this ordinance and other appropriate sections of
44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.
ii. Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain
Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance.
(2) Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement of
manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.
(3) Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of this
ordinance.
(4) Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained
from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.
(5) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
field conditions) the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
(6) Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Agency which is the
Utah Division of Water Rights, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(7) Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is
maintained.
(8) When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Part 6,a, the Floodplain
Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway
data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Part 8.
(9) When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain Administrator must require that
no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted
within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any
point within the community.
(10) Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations, a community may approve certain development in ZonesA1-30, AE, AH, on the
community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one
foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(Conditional Letter of Map Revision).
(11) Where flood way velocities are generally determined to be under five feet (5’) per second and
maximum flood depth will not exceed three feet (3’), such uses as cultivated agriculture, nurseries,
parks and recreation facilities and accessory parking may be permitted.
(12) Lots that contain land in the floodplain area shall contain a minimum area outside the floodplain
corresponding to the underlying zone. For example, a lot in the TR-10,000 zone must have at least
10,000 sq. ft. of land above the 100-Year Recurrence Interval Flood. CR-20,000 lots in a floodplain
must have at least 20,000 sq. ft. of land above 100-Year Recurrence Interval Flood. A CR-40,000 lot
in a floodplain must have at least 40,000 sq. ft. of land above 100-Year Recurrence Interval Flood.
Whenever 100-Year Recurrence Interval Flood data is not available, the required area as described
above will be five feet above the elevation of the maximum flood of record.

structure shall meet the flood proofing criteria of Part 8,b,ii;
(4) Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as
a result of proposed development.
(5) Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with Part 7,b,i.
Approval or denial of a Development Permit by the Floodplain Administrator shall be based on all of
the provisions of this ordinance and the following relevant factors:
(A) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(B) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
(C) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(D) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(E) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(F) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems;
(G) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
(H) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

iv. Variance Procedures.
(1) The Alpine City Land Use Appeal Authority as established by the community shall hear and render
judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
(2) The Appeal Authority shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
(3) Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may appeal such decision in
the courts of competent jurisdiction.
(4) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(5) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the
procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance.
(6) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Part 7,c,ii have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
(7) Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the Appeal Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this ordinance (Part 3).
(8) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result.
(9) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that
the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
(10) Prerequisites for granting variances:
(A) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(B) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) showing a good and sufficient cause;
(b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant, and
(c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(C) Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure
will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
(11) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for
other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(A) the criteria outlined in Parts 7,d,i through 7,d,ix are met, and
(B) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

ii. Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided
as set forth in (i) Part 6,b, (ii) Part 7,b,viii, or (iii) Part 8,c,iii, the following provisions are required:
(1) Residential Construction. - new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure
shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this Part as proposed in Part 7,c,i, is satisfied.
(2) Nonresidential Construction. - new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be

provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(4) Manufactured Homes.
(A) Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or
FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the
purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
(B) Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-
30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or
subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of
a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
(C) Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's
FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of the previous Part 8,b,iv,2 be elevated so that
either:
(a) the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or

iv. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in Part 6,b, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the
path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

(A) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least
as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no
depth number is specified), or;
(B) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood
level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
(3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain
Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Part 7,c,i, are satisfied.
(4) Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood
waters around and away from proposed structures.

v. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3, Section B, are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) If Part 6,b is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Part 8.
(3) Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance
Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that
would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a
conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.
i. Penalties for Noncompliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. Violation of the
provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute an infraction. Any person who violates this
ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $750,
for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent Alpine City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

The Hillside Protection Overlay shall comply with DCA 4.05.040 Parts 4-9, limits to development of the Land Use
Element of the Alpine City General Plan as adopted by the Alpine City Council on July 28, 1997 as follows:
Development will not be permitted where any part of the zoning lot is above an elevation of 5350 feet Mean Sea
Level except it is demonstrated that such development or structure complies with the following conditions in addition
to all other conditions defined in the underlying zone, and additions or conditions as recommended by the Planning
Commission and approved by the City Council.
b. PROVISIONS. The provisions herein are designed to accomplish the following:
i. Encourage the location, design and development of building sites to provide maximum safety, and human
enjoyment while adapting the development to the natural terrain;
ii. Provide for safe circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to public and private areas minimizing the
scarring and erosion effects of cutting, filling and grading related to hillside construction;
iii. Prohibit activities and uses, which would result in degradation of fragile soils and steep slopes.
iv. Encourage preservation of open space to preserve the natural terrain.
v. Minimize flooding by protecting streams, drainage channels, absorption areas and flood plains from
substantial alteration of the natural functions.
c. OVERLAY ZONE - SCOPE - CONFLICT RESOLUTION. The Hillside Protection Zone shall be an overlay zone of
the zone classifications set out in the Alpine Zoning Ordinance. Any permitted use in a district overlaid by the Hillside
Protection Zone is a conditional use. Conditional uses authorized in districts overlaid by the Hillside Protection Zone
remain conditional uses. In case of conflict between the provisions of the existing zoning classification, building
code, subdivision ordinance and/or other City ordinance and the Hillside Protection Overlay Zone, the most
restrictive provision shall apply. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to expand a use, make less restrictive a
use, or allow a use which is not otherwise permitted in the zoning district overlaid by the Hillside Protection Zone.

The City recognizes the benefit of private participation in caring for these lands. Therefore, individual citizens and citizen
groups shall be allowed and encouraged to improve and maintain
open spaces. However, these improvements shall be governed by guidelines incorporated in this ordinance, which includes
specific rules for each designation.
All requests for improvements and maintenance of City-owned property by citizens shall be presented in writing and
recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council. These requests shall include a written or
drawn landscape design. Approval of such requests will be granted based on adherence to general and designation
guidelines, compliance with City ordinances and a visit to the site. If approved, the request will be kept on file for further
reference.
Any landscaping, maintenance or other improvements to public lands which does not receive prior approval as specified
within this ordinance shall be deemed an encroachment. All such encroachments shall incur a penalty (fine) as established
by the City Council. Upon direction of the City Council and after 30 days notice from the City Administrator, such
encroachments are subject to removal and the area involved shall be restored to its original condition at the citizen’s
expense.
a. General Improvement Guidelines. The following guidelines apply to all improvements to publicly-owned lands
i. Homeowners have no right to encroach on publicly-owned lands. These open spaces are not to be
considered or treated as an extension of private property. Without a recommendation from the Planning
Commission and approval of the City Council, all of the following apply:
(1) Grass, trees or shrubbery may not be planted.
(2) Fences may not be erected.
(3) Grading may not be done.
(4) Sprinkler systems may not be installed.
(5) Vegetation may not be cut or destroyed.
(6) Rain gutter or other drainage may not be directed onto public lands.
(7) All other encroachments are expressly forbidden.
ii. When permission is granted to individuals or groups to improve public lands, all such improvements become
the property of the City.
(1) The City is ultimately responsible for care and maintenance of such improvements.
(2) The City may remove any elements as it deems necessary.
(3) Written City approval must be obtained for any private parties to remove any such elements.
iii. When permission is given to private parties to improve public lands with landscaping, these same parties will
be required to maintain these improvements, unless otherwise specified. When approved the following
general guidelines apply to all designations except natural (conservation) areas:
(1) All sprinkling piping and heads are to be located entirely on private property. Drip irrigation pipes may
go into the easements and would be the preferred watering method. Water may spray on planted
landscaping, but shall not spray on the trail.
(2) Shrubs may be planted within the trail easement, but must be no more than 2 feet high and be kept
pruned back from the trail edge.
(3) Non-invasive groundcovers may be planted in the trail easement but shall be kept off the trail. Low
and slow-growing junipers, cotoneaster, vincas and grasses are examples of acceptable plants.
(4) All trees are to be planted outside the trail corridor.
(5) When written permission is granted for donated trees to be planted on public lands, they must be
placed randomly, rather than parallel to private property lines, as such placement gives the visual
effect of increasing the private area and effectually decreasing the public open space.

3.17.020 Permitted Uses
a. Trail Usage. Alpine trails are multi-use for pedestrians, equestrians, bicyclists and other similar non-motorized uses.
ADA (American Disability Act) access for motorized wheelchairs shall be indicated by signage.
(Ord. 99-08, 8-10-99; Amended by Ord. 2004-11, 7/13/04; Ord. 2008-05, 7/22/08; Ord. 2009-06, 4/28/09)

3.17.050 Purpose Of Improved Trails
Trails encourage and enhance public use of open spaces and may be added to any public area, within the guidelines of
each designation, as deemed necessary by the City, and following recommended procedures for improvements.
a. Trails serve to protect the terrain. Without improved trails, pedestrians, equestrians, and cyclists create erosion and
can effectively destroy the aesthetic aspects of any open space. In sensitive areas, the City may limit usage to
improved trails only.
b. Trails sanction public use of these lands. Without a clearly marked trail, it is difficult for citizens to know if they are
within their rights to traverse open spaces; therefore, usage is inhibited.
c. Trails are an effective way to direct traffic. They can and should be placed to maximize the privacy of neighboring
residences.
(Ord. 99-08, 8-10-99; Amended by Ord. 2004-11, 7/13/04; Ord. 2008-05, 7/22/08; Ord. 2009-06, 4/28/09)

i. No motorized vehicles shall be allowed on trails except for vehicles performing trail maintenance, emergency
vehicles, motorized wheel chairs on trails which are ADA (American Disability Act) accessible, or as
designated by the City Council.

restricted to specific types of use, such as cycling, horseback riding, cross country skiing or as established by
the City Council.
iii. Open fires will not be allowed except in City-installed fire pits in such places as the Bowery and historic Moyle
Park.

The City Council of Alpine hereby finds that Senior Housing is a necessary component of a well-rounded and sustainable
community. Further, the City Council of Alpine hereby finds that current demographic trends indicate a substantial increase
in the aging population and the City deems it necessary and desirable to address such trends by providing proper housing
to give seniors the opportunity to socialize with one another and engage in minimal or no individual yard care by providing
for development of planned units with professional maintenance of common areas in a park-like setting. Carefully planned

3.21.070 Additional Water Rights May Be Required To Be Conveyed To The City - Adjustments
a. Amount Required. Water rights in an amount sufficient to satisfy the water use requirements for the Zoning Lot
shall be conveyed to the City. The amount of additional water rights required, if any, shall be in an amount sufficient
to satisfy the water use requirements of the proposed use of the Zoning Lot determined in accordance with the
following formula, as may be adjusted based on the provisions below:
i. Residential Uses. Water rights in an amount sufficient to satisfy the water use requirements for the lot for
which the dwelling is proposed based on the following formula:
Water Right Requirement (in acre feet) = (1.66) area in lots (in acres) + 0.45 x number of lots
ii. Other Users. An amount sufficient to satisfy the projected needs of the proposed development, as
determined by Alpine City.
NOTE: The above requirements are based on the results of the 1994 Alpine City Water Use Study by
Horrocks Engineers and reflected in an amendment to the Alpine City General Plan adopting a water rights
acquisition policy.
b. Type of Water Rights Acceptable For Conveyance. Water rights proposed for conveyance to the City shall be of a
type which allow for municipal use within the City, or, if not, the water rights must be of the type which can be
amended to provide for municipal use in accordance with the procedures of Utah's change application statute, Utah
Code Ann. ' 73-3-3. The water rights may include one or a combination of the following:
i. Alpine Irrigation Company Stock.
Primary Shares - One-third (1/3) share for each acre-foot of water right required.
Secondary Shares - One full share for each acre foot required.
ii. Other irrigation water stock or water rights sufficient water rights to equal the number of acre feet required for
the proposed development, after any reduction in quantity by the State Engineer.
iii. Well Rights. The right to divert from a well source. These water rights shall be evidenced by an approved
application to appropriate, an underground water claim or court decree.
iv. Previously Conveyed Rights. Assignment of interest in water shares or credits to the use of water which have
been previously conveyed to the City in anticipation of development (e.g., Busch Well).
Prior to acceptance of water rights, the City shall evaluate the rights proposed for conveyance and may
refuse to accept any right which it determines to be insufficient in annual quantity or flow rate, or not
reasonably likely to be approved for change to municipal purposes within the City by the State Engineer. In
determining the quantity of water available under the water rights, the City will evaluate the priority of the
water rights and the historic average quantities of water available to the water rights.
c. Not Applicable to Lots in Subdivisions. The water conveyance requirements set forth herein shall not be
applicable to lots within previously approved and recorded subdivisions.

https://alpine.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=3_Zoning 91/141
d. Credit for Previously Conveyed Water Rights. All water rights previously conveyed, whether as part of the
annexation process or otherwise, shall be considered as a credit toward satisfying the requirements of this section.
e. Adjustments to Water Conveyance Requirements Permitted Under Certain Circumstances. Where the Zoning
Lot or parcel contains lands where, as a result of topographic features (e.g., steep slopes) or other environmentally
sensitive or fragile conditions, the availability of irrigation water for use on the lot, or other conditions, will be
permanently restricted from any use or activity requiring the use of water from the City's culinary water system, the
City may reduce the amount or water rights required to be conveyed in an amount commensurate with the portion of
the Zoning Lot or parcel so restricted against the use of water. Any request for reduction shall include enforceable
provisions for securing the restricted condition in a form to be approved by Alpine City.
f. Time of Conveyance. The conveyance of title to the water rights, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and
claims of any nature, shall occur prior to the receipt of a building permit for the Zoning Lot.

g. Hardship Relief Provisions
i. Hardship Relief Petition. Any applicant for a building permit on a Zoning Lot under the provisions of this
section, either prior to or at the time of the submission of an application for a building permit to the Building
Official, may file a hardship relief petition with the City Recorder seeking relief from all or a part of the water
rights acquisition policy requirements as contained in this ordinance on the basis that the requirements, as
applied to the applicant or the specific property for which a building permit is being requested, has no
reasonable relationship to the needs created or benefits conferred upon the proposed development, does not
demonstrably benefit the proposed development, is duplicative, results in the deprivation of all reasonable
use of the property, or is otherwise unlawful pursuant to the standards of applicable case law or statutes then
in effect.
ii. Economic Hardship Standard. For the purposes of this ordinance, a substantial economic hardship shall be
defined as applying the requirements of the water rights acquisition policy in such a manner that it has no
reasonable relationship to the needs created or benefits conferred upon the proposed development, does not
demonstrably benefit the proposed development, is duplicative, results in the deprivation of all reasonable
use of the property, or is otherwise unlawful pursuant to the standards of applicable case law or statutes then
in effect. The Planning Commission and City Council shall not find a substantial economic hardship if such a
hardship is self imposed. The mere fact that the land or parcel of property in question has not historically had
water rights associated with it is not a sufficient basis to determine the existence of a substantial economic
hardship. The City Council may not modify or grant the petitioner relief from any of the provisions of the
Alpine City water rights acquisition policy unless it finds that granting the petition will not substantially affect
the General Plan, will not be contrary to the public interest, and will not undermine the ability of Alpine City to
provide water rights in a sufficient amount to meet the reasonable needs of its residents for culinary,
irrigation, fire protection and other purposes.
iii. Information to be Submitted with Hardship Relief Petition. The hardship relief petition must be submitted in a
form acceptable to the City, shall be signed by the applicant and verified and must be accompanied by a
minimum of the following information:
(1) Name of the applicant;
(2) Name and business address of the current owner of the property and form of ownership;
(3) Nature of the interest owned by the applicant in the subject property;
(4) A complete description of all water rights and/or water shares owned by the applicant;
(5) A complete description of all water rights and water shares which have been utilized on the subject
property during the ten (10) years prior to the date of the application;
(6) A description of all water rights and water shares conveyed to the City by the applicant, related to the
subject property;
(7) A description of any water rights or water shares conveyed to the City by any prior owner of the
subject property during the ten (10) years prior to the date of the application, related to the subject
property;
(8) A complete description of the disposition or sale of any water rights or water shares related to the
subject property during the ten (10) years prior to the date of the application;
(9) All studies and reports prepared by the applicant, their agents or prior owners regarding water usage
and/or availability of water related to the subject property during the previous ten (10) years prior to
the date of the application;
(10) A report in a form acceptable to Alpine City showing all recorded liens, encumbrances and ownership
interests related to all water rights and water shares related to the subject property as of the date of
the petition;
(11) Copies of all relevant documents evidencing or relating to water rights and water shares related to the
subject property;
(12) A specific and detailed description of the basis for the applicant's assertion that the water rights
acquisition policy is unlawful, inequitable or otherwise should be modified with respect to the applicant
and the subject property for which the building permit is requested based on the standards set forth in
this ordinance;
(13) A specific description of the modifications of the Alpine City water rights acquisition policy which
petitioner is requesting with the supporting factual basis for such assertion.
The Planning Commission and/or City Council may request additional information reasonable
necessary, in their opinion, to arrive at a conclusion regarding the hardship relief petition.

3.21.100 Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LGP)
The following information is to be used whenever residential underground or aboveground propane tanks are installed in
Alpine City. This information is to correlate with the NFPA 58 and International Fire Code.
a. All installations shall comply with this ordinance and with all applicable regulations including Utah State Code, the
International Fire Code, and NFPA 58.
b. All approved LPG installations and burying of underground tanks and lines must be witnessed in the presence of an
LPG licensed contractor and inspected by the Fire Department.
c. Installer Certification. Installation and burying of any LPG tank(s) is only to be done by individuals or companies that
are certified and licensed through the Utah State Fire Marshal’s Office.
d. Building Permit. A building permit shall be required for all underground LPG tanks. A permit shall be required for all
aboveground LPG tanks that are 125 gallons water capacity or greater. Two sets of plans shall be submitted and a
permit must be obtained prior to any installation and all fees paid in advance.

g. Underground LPG Tanks
i. Sand Base. Although concrete foundations are required, sand should still be used in the bottom of the hole
for drainage. It is a good practice to put a 6-12 inch layer of coarse sand in the bottom of the hole before
setting the tank. (NFPA 6.6.6.1 (k))
ii. Water Tables. Underground LPG tanks are not allowed in areas of Alpine City were high water tables exist or
in federal flood zones, unless approved by the Fire Chief. Provisions must be made to adequately secure the
tank to the ground, or by a concrete slab to prevent flotation. Remember that a properly filled propane tank
can float because the density of propane is about half that of water. Where straps come in contact with the
tank, protection between the tank and the straps is to be provided. Thick tar-paper, celetex, etc. that is water
resistant will suffice. (NFPA 6.6.1.6)
iii. Corrosion Protection Equipment. In order to reduce the problem of corrosion of underground LPG tanks,
sacrificial anodes are to be installed in the ground near the tank. The anodes are connected by a copper
cable to the tank. Anodes are usually a soft metal, such as magnesium or zinc. They are made as solid rods
or stakes, as well as soft powder in small bags. These must be installed as per tank manufacturer’s
specifications. (NFPA 6.14)
iv. Tank Coating. Underground tanks must be designed and coated for underground installation. They are
usually factory coated. However, coatings may have been scratched off during transportation and installation.
As a result, the tank must be touched up with the same type of paint or coating on site prior to being installed
in the ground. (NFPA 6.6.6 I & 6.6.6.2 (2))
v. Tank Depth. The top of the tank when set in the hold must be at least six (6) inches below grade. If the tank
is to be installed in an area where vehicles may travel close to the tank, the tank must be installed at least
eighteen (18) inches below grade with compacted soil on top. (NFPA 6.6.6.1a, b)
vi. Backfill. The hole is to be backfilled with coarse sand and will be free of rocks and abrasives. The tank
surface is not to be scratched. A minimum of twelve (12) inches of backfill is to be tamped down around the
tank, then an additional twelve (12) inches is filled in and tamped, etc. until the hole is full. (NFPA 6.6.6.1 (K))
vii. Location of Containers. The minimum separation between containers installed underground will be three (3)
feet. No part of an underground ASME container will be less than 10 feet from a building or line of adjoining
property that can be built upon. See attached tables. (NFPA Table 6.3.1) (IFC 3804)
viii. Vehicular Traffic. Where containers are installed underground and within 10 feet of where vehicular traffic can
be expected, protection against vehicular damage will be provided for the fitting housing cover, tank
connections, and piping. (NFPA 6.6.6.1 d)
ix. LPG Testing of Piping System. All residential piping for LPG installations will be tested a minimum of 10
minutes and tested with an approved gas detector, a non-corrosive leak detection fluid or other approved
leak detection methods.
x. Burying Lines. Buried metallic pipe and tubing shall be installed underground with a minimum twelve (12)
inch of cover. The minimum cover shall be increased to eighteen (18) inches if external damage to the pipe
or tubing from external forces is likely to result.
If a minimum twelve (12) inch of cover cannot be maintained, the piping shall be installed in conduit or shall
be bridged (shielded). (NFPA 6.8.12) Where an underground piping is beneath driveways, roads, or streets,
possible damage by vehicles shall be taken into account. (NFPA 6.8.13)
xi. Tracer Wire. An electrically continuous corrosion-resistant tracer wire (minimum AWG 14) or tape shall be
buried with the polyamide or polyethylene pipe to facilitate locating the pipe.
(1) One end of the tracer wire shall be brought aboveground at a building wall or riser.
(2) The tracer wire or tape shall not be in direct contact with the polyamide or polyethylene pipe.

h. Aboveground LPG Tanks
i. Tank Locations. Tank location must comply with proper distances from buildings, roadways, property lines,
separation distances from other tanks and away from overhead electrical lines. (Consult IFC Table 3804.3)
(NFPA 6.3.1)
ii. Combustible Materials. Weeds, grass, bush, trash and other combustible materials are kept a minimum of ten
(10) feet away from LPG tanks. (IFC 3807.3)
iii. Guard Posts. If exposed to vehicular damage due to proximity to alleys, driveways or parking areas, LPG
tanks, regulators and piping will be protected by guard posts constructed of steel, not less than four (4)
inches in diameter, filled with concrete. Posts are to be spaced not more than four (4) feet apart, buried three
(3) feet in the ground in concrete not less than fifteen (15) inches in diameter. Set with the tops of the posts
not less than three (3) feet above the ground and located not less than three (3) feet from the tank. Other
means of tank protection if approved may consist of landscape type boulders, cement walls, etc. (NFPA
amended) (IFC 3807.4)
iv. Underneath Buildings. LPG cylinders cannot be installed underneath any building unless the space is open to
the atmosphere for fifty (50) percent of its perimeter or more. (NFPA 6.3.8)
v. Painting. The tank is to have a light color to prevent heat absorption. (NFPA 6.6.1.4)
vi. Power Lines. The LPG tanks and any of its parts will not be located within six (6) feet of a vertical plane
beneath overhead electric power lines that are more than 600 volts.
(NFPA 6.4.5.12)
vii. Installation Foundation. Tanks will be installed upon a firm foundation or be otherwise firmly secured.
Recommended is a four (4) inch thick concrete pad. The cylinder will not be in contact with the soil. (NFPA
6.6.1.4)
viii. LPG Testing of Piping System. All residential piping for LPG installations will be tested a minimum of ten (10)
minutes and tested with an approved gas detector, a non-corrosive leak detection fluid or other approved
leak detection methods.
ix. Burying Lines. Buried metallic pipe and tubing shall be installed underground with a minimum twelve (12)
inch of cover. The minimum cover shall be increased to eighteen (18) inches if external damage to the pipe
or tubing from external forces is likely to result. If a minimum twelve (12) inch of cover cannot be maintained,
the piping shall be installed in conduit or shall be bridged (shielded). (NFPA 6.8.12) Where underground
piping is beneath driveways, roads, or streets, possible damage by vehicles shall be taken into account.
(NFPA 6.8.13)
x. Tracer Wire. An electrically continuous corrosion-resistant tracer wire (minimum AWG 14) or tape shall be
buried with the polyamide or polyethylene pipe to facilitate locating the pipe.
(1) One end of the tracer wire shall be brought aboveground at a building wall or riser.
(2) The tracer wire or tape shall not be in direct contact with the polyamide or polyethylene pipe.

b. Purpose & Intent. The unique character, landscapes and scenic vistas of Alpine are among its most valuable
assets. Preserving and promoting those assets are essential to the long- range social and economic wellbeing of the
City and its inhabitants. Protecting these assets requires sensitive placement and design of wireless communication
facilities so that these facilities remain in scale and harmony with the existing character of the community.
i. To amend Ordinance No. 2006-06 to accommodate new technology and develop regulations on the use and
development of City property for new cell tower facilities.
ii. To regulate personal wireless services antennas, with or without support structures, and related electronic
equipment and equipment structures.
iii. To provide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the City.
iv. To minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the co-location of multiple antennas
on a single new or existing structure.
v. To establish siting, appearance and safety standards that will help mitigate the potential impacts related to
the construction, use and maintenance of personal wireless communication facilities.
vi. To comply with the Telecommunication Act of 1996 by establishing regulations that (1) do not prohibit or have
the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, (2) do not unreasonably discriminate
among providers of functionally equivalent services, and (3) are not based on the environmental effects of
radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Federal Communications
Commission’s regulations concerning such emissions.
c. Findings
i. Personal wireless services facilities (PWSF) are an integral part of the rapidly growing and evolving
telecommunications industry, and present unique zoning challenges and concerns by the City.
ii. The City needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its customers to
provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the City, against the sometimes differing
interests and desires of others concerning health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics, and orderly planning of the
community.
iii. The City has experienced an increased demand for personal wireless services facilities to be located in the
City, and expects the increased demand to continue in the future.
iv. It is in the best interests of the City to have quality personal wireless services facilities available, which
necessarily entails the erection of personal wireless services facilities in the City.
v. The unnecessary proliferation of personal wireless services facilities through the City creates a negative
visual impact on the community.
vi. The visual effects of personal wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their
siting, construction, maintenance and use.
vii. A private property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who
receives compensation for the facility, even though numerous other property owners in the area are
adversely affected by the location of the facility.
viii. Chapter 69-3, Utah Code Annotated, grants cities the authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the
erection of telecommunications tower in order to promote the location of telecommunication towers in a
manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area. The law also allows the City to
require the owner of any tower to accommodate the multiple use of the tower by other companies where
feasible and to pay the City the fair market rental value for the use of any City-owned site.
ix. Telecommunications towers located on government property with the lease payments being paid to Alpine
City instead of individual property owners evenly distributes the income from the lease payments to all
citizens of Alpine through increased government services thus indirectly compensating all of the citizens of
Alpine for the impact all citizens experience. The public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of
telecommunications towers and to mitigate their impact can be best facilitated by locating
telecommunications and antenna support structures on property owned, leased or used by Alpine City as a
highest priority whenever feasible.

geologic hazard and engineering geology reports (DCA 3.12.060 Part 4)
d. Engineer Design Required. All retaining walls required to obtain a building permit shall be designed by an engineer
licensed by the State of Utah.
e. Height, Separation and Plantings
i. For the purposes of this Part, the height of a retaining wall is measured as exposed height (H) of wall of an
individual tier.
ii. A single retaining wall shall not exceed nine feet in exposed height if it can be seen from the nearest public
right-of-way or adjacent properties to which it is exposed.
iii. Terracing of retaining walls is permitted where justified by topographic conditions, but the combined height of
all walls shall not exceed a height of 18 feet if exposed or can be seen from the nearest public right-of-way or
adjacent properties. Walls with a separation of at least 2H (H of largest of 2 walls) from face of wall to face of
wall shall be considered as separate walls for analysis purposes and applicability to this ordinance. If walls
are within 2H (H of largest of 2 walls), then the combined height of the terrace shall be used for limitation of
height.
iv. In a terrace of retaining walls, a minimum horizontal separation of H/2 (H of largest of 2 walls) is required as
measured from back of lower wall to face of higher wall. If the walls are not viewable from the nearest public
right-of-way or adjacent properties, then there is no limitation of height.
v. The view of the nearest public right-of-way or adjacent property shall be verified by the City Official during the
review process and prior to permit for construction.
vi. For terraced walls viewable from the nearest public right-of-way, the horizontal separation between walls
shall be planted with a minimum of five shrubs for every 20 linear feet of planting area. The size of the shrubs
shall be less than one-half the width of the terrace. Shrubs shall be watered by drip irrigation to minimize
erosion by property owner, not by Alpine City.
vii. Walls greater than four (4) feet in height (H) placed within H/2 of an adjacent property line, which would
create a drop-off for the adjacent property, shall install a fence along the top of the wall in accordance with
ADC 3.21.060.
viii. No retaining wall component shall extend beyond the property lines unless written permission is obtained
from the affected property owner.

l. Due to the limited size of the city's rights-of-way, applicants shall be required to install any Small Wireless Facility
equipment according the following requirements to the extent operationally and technically feasible and to the extent
permitted by law. Small Wireless Facility equipment shall be installed either:
i. On or within the pole. If the equipment is installed on the pole, the equipment enclosure must be flush with
the pole, painted to reasonably match the color of the pole, may not exceed in width the diameter of the pole
by more than three inches on either side, the furthest point may not exceed eighteen inches from the pole,
and the base must be flush with the grade or, alternatively, the lowest point may not be lower than eight and
one-half feet from the grade directly below the equipment enclosure. If the equipment is installed within the
pole, no equipment may protrude from the pole except to the extent reasonably necessary to connect to
power or a wireline.
ii. Underground. All underground equipment shall be installed and maintained level with the surrounding grade.
To the extent possible, any equipment installed underground shall be located in a park strip within the city's
rights-of-way. If a park strip is unavailable, the provider may install equipment within a city-owned sidewalk
within the right-of-way. However, underground equipment installed in a sidewalk may not be located within
any driveway, pedestrian ramp, or immediately in front of a walkway or entrance to a building. To the extent
possible, underground equipment being located in a sidewalk may not be installed in the center of the
sidewalk, but should be installed as close to the edge of the sidewalk as is structurally viable.
iii. On private property in an existing building or in an enclosure. If equipment is placed on private property, the
applicant shall provide written permission from the property owner allowing the applicant to locate facilities on
the property. If equipment is placed in an enclosure, the enclosure shall be designed to blend in with existing
surroundings, using architecturally compatible construction and colors, and landscaping and shall be located
as unobtrusively as possible consistent with the proper functioning of the Small Wireless Facility.
m. As required for the operation of a Small Wireless Facility or its equipment, an electric meter may be installed in
accordance with requirements from the electric provider; provided, that the electric meter must be installed in the
location that (1) minimizes its interference with other users of the city's rights-of-way including, but not limited to,
pedestrians, motorists, and other entities with equipment in the right-of-way, and (2) minimizes its aesthetic impact.
n. The city shall not provide an exemption to these requirements when there is insufficient room in the right-of-way to
place facilities at ground-level and comply with ADA requirements, public safety concerns for pedestrians, cyclists,
and motorists, or other specifically identified public safety concerns.
o. All Small Wireless Facilities shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding
properties and the traveling public to the greatest extent reasonably possible within one hundred feet of a site and
consistent with the proper functioning of the Small Wireless Facility. Such Small Wireless Facilities and equipment
enclosures shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site.
Such small wireless facilities shall also be designed to either resemble the surrounding landscape and other natural
features where located in proximity to natural surroundings, or be compatible with the built environment, through
matching and complimentary existing structures and specific design considerations such as architectural designs,
height, scale, color and texture or be consistent with other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant vicinity.
p. Stealth design is required and concealment techniques must be appropriate given the proposed location, design,
visual environment, and nearby uses, structures, and natural features. Stealth design shall be designed and
constructed to substantially conform to surrounding utility poles, light poles, or other similar support structures in the
right-of-way so the Small Wireless Facility is visually unobtrusive. Stealth design requires screening Small Wireless
Facilities in order to reduce visual impact. The provider must screen all substantial portions of the facility from view.
Such screening should match the color and be of similar finish of the attached support structure. Antennas, antenna
arrays, and equipment must be installed flush with any pole or support structure (including antennas or antenna
arrays mounted directly above the top of an existing pole or support structure) and the furthest point of an antenna,
antenna array, or equipment may not extend beyond eighteen inches from the pole or support structure except if the
pole owner requires use of a standoff to comply with federal, state, or local rules, regulations, or laws. Any required
standoff may not defeat stealth design and concealment techniques. Stealth and concealment techniques do not
include incorporating faux-tree designs of a kind that are not native to the state.
q. No facilities may bear any signage or advertisement except as permitted herein.

resulting from a new development. Such analysis shall address traffic
increases on residential streets, addition to traffic flows during peak period
(such as the morning commute) and any anticipated needs created for new
traffic corridors.
(2) Culinary Water and Sewer. Impacts on the sewer and culinary water
supply must be addressed. Utility accesses should be noted and any
potential impacts discussed as they relate to health, safety or barriers to
movement of residents or wildlife.
(3) Storm Drainage. In addition to the drainage plan required with subdivision
submission, the report must address any potential impacts on the purity of
ground water or subsurface aquifers that may result from the planned
development. Point sources of any discharge to public waterways must be
shown and non-point sources shall be identified if changes are anticipated

features that may be inconsistent with retention of views or a rural
atmosphere. Any features of development that will contrast with
surrounding land uses will also be addressed, including population
densities that are significantly different from adjacent areas or any
anticipated changes in cultural patterns in the area. The report must also
note any sites of historical significance either on or within a quarter-mile of
the development site.
(2) View Scapes. Address aspects of development that may impact view
sheds including any landscape design features that may be inconsistent
with retention of views. This section should also include any unusual cuts
or fills required and any development on hillsides or prominent rises.
(3) Parks, Trails and Recreational Facilities. Address the impact on demand
for existing Alpine City recreational facilities in accordance with DCA
4.07.200, and indicate what features or facilities, if any, will be included in
the development to contribute to the recreational needs of both residents
and non- residents of the development. The following specific recreational
aspects will be considered and any significant impacts addressed:
(A) Hiking, walking and jogging
(B) Access to mountains
(C) Location of parks
(D) Open space
(E) Picnicking
(F) Sports activities
(4) Noise. Proposed developments that include other than residential uses
must contain an evaluation of the potential for increased noise. If an
increase is anticipated in the ambient noise level as a result of the
development, all other land uses within a half- mile radius must be
identified, and the potential impact of the noise increase on those existing
uses will be evaluated. Intermittent noise that may result from uses
anticipated at the completed development must be identified if it will be outof-
character, whether due to intensity or frequency, with noise generated
by existing uses within a half-mile radius.

6. THE PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL
a. The City Planner and Planning Commission shall determine whether the preliminary plan
conforms to the Zoning Ordinance.
b. The Planning Commission upon the advice of the City Engineer, or other advisors shall
determine from a review of the Preliminary Design Plan whether the soil, slope,
vegetation and the drainage characteristics of the site are such as to require substantial
cutting, clearing, grading and other earth-moving operations in the construction of the
subdivision, or otherwise entail an erosion hazard, and, if so, the Planning Commission
shall require the subdivider to provide soil erosion and sedimentation control plans and
specifications. Such control plans and specifications shall be prepared by a person
trained and qualified in such matters, as is determined by the Planning Commission using
the County conservation standards, with the costs of preparation of such plans and
specifications being borne by the subdivider, and to be approved by the City Engineer.
c. When, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, public facilities should be constructed
within the boundaries of a proposed subdivision to achieve community standards
established in the Alpine General Plan, the subdivider shall reserve a site appropriate in
area and location for such public facility. Such site shall be reserved by the subdivider for
a period of not less than two (2) years from the date of Preliminary Design Plan approval,
to provide the appropriate public agency an opportunity to purchase the site. A
determination by the Planning Commission to require such a reservation by a subdivider
shall be made in writing and shall state the reasons for such requirement.
d. After review of the preliminary plan at a public meeting, the Planning Commission shall
approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions the preliminary design plan, or may
postpone action to allow the subdivider time to provide material or additional information
needed by the Planning Commission to then determine appropriate action.
e. Planning Commission approval of the preliminary plan shall expire 180 calendar days
after the date of approval. Reinstatements may be granted by the Planning Commission,
and will be subject to all applicable ordinances at the time of reinstatement and a
reinstatement fee will be charged in accordance with the current fee schedule.

required to provide adequate circulation – Temporary turnaround required in certain instances--
Subsequent development of adjacent property to incorporate.
a. In order to facilitate the development of an adequate and convenient circulation system
within the City, and to provide access for the logical development of adjacent vacant
properties, the City shall, as a condition of approval, require the subdivision plan to
include one or more temporary dead end streets (stub streets) which extend to the
boundary of the parcel, and dedicate the right-of-way to the property line to the City to
insure that adjacent properties are not landlocked.
b. All such stub streets shall be fully developed with full City street and utility improvements
to the boundary of the subdivision unless it can be shown by the applicant for the
subdivision that the need for a fully improved street does not have an essential link to a
legitimate government interest or that the requirement to fully improve the stub street is
not roughly proportionate, both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed
subdivision on the City.
c. Factors to be considered in determining whether or not the requirement to install a fully
improved street is considered proportionate may include but not be limited to:
i. The estimated cost to improve the stub street;
ii. Whether or not the stub street will be essential to provide reasonable access to
the undeveloped parcel;
iii. The number of lots in the proposed subdivision that will be accessed from the
improved stub street;
iv. The estimated number of lots that can be developed in the future on the adjacent
undeveloped parcel through use of the stub street.
After receiving a recommendation by the Planning Commission, if the City Council
determines that the stub street need not be fully developed either because it does
not further a legitimate government interest or that the requirement is
disproportionate to the impact of the proposed subdivision on the City, then only
the right-of-way for the stub street shall be dedicated to the City and the
requirement to improve the stub street shall be placed on the undeveloped
adjacent parcel as a condition of the development if the adjacent property is ever
developed.
d. Any such stub street having a length of more than 150 feet or providing primary vehicular
access to one or more lots shall be terminated by an improved temporary turn-around
designed and constructed in accordance with the City Standards. Where any portion of
the temporary turn-around is to be located on private property, use of the portion located
on private property by the public shall be secured through the conveyance of an
easement for that purpose.
e. Any plan for the subsequent development of the adjacent property shall provide for the
continuation of any such stub street and shall bear the burden of designing such stub
street or streets in accordance with City standards.
4. Intersections. Intersections of minor streets with major streets shall be kept to the minimum.

shall be provided on each side of the street unless parking is prohibited.
8. Partial-Width Streets. All streets within and adjacent to a subdivision shall either have been
previously conveyed to the City by deed or dedication or shall be shown on the final plat for
dedication to the City for street purposes.
All streets shown on the final plat for dedication to the City shall conform to the minimum
standards for street width and improvements for the entire width of the street, except that the City
Council may accept the dedication and improvement of partial width streets provided:
a. That the proposed partial width street is located at the border of the subdivision and the
land abutting the proposed uncompleted side of the street is not owned by the subdivider.
b. The width of the right-of-way of the partial width street shall be not less than thirty- nine
(39) feet in the instance of a minor class street and forty-two (42) feet in the instance of a

It is unlawful to divide real property in such a way that a parcel of property is created or left behind that
cannot be developed according to the ordinances of Alpine City governing zoning and subdivisions, and
other applicable laws, regardless of whether or not a subdivision plat is required for the division.
Examples of such divisions include, but are not limited to, nuisance or protection strips, parcels created
or left for the sole purpose of denying or restricting another property owner access to his or her property,
parcels with insufficient square footage for building, and parcels that do not abut on a dedicated street.

No subdivision plan shall have the effect of leaving a residual zoning lot for which the required
subdivision improvements: (1) have not been previously constructed, or (2) are not to be included as
part of the required improvements for the proposed subdivision. For purposes of this section a residual
zoning lot shall be construed to include a parcel created by the proposed subdivision but not included as
a lot on the final plat, which qualifies as a zoning lot, but because of insufficient size, dimension or other
limitation is not readily capable of further division in accordance with the requirements of the zoning
ordinance.

4.07.230 Water Rights Required To Be Conveyed To The City
1. Water Rights Required - Determination of Amount. Any person proposing to subdivide land
with the City shall, as a condition of subdivision approval, convey to the City water rights that
entitle the owner to an annual quantity and rate of flow which is sufficient in amount to meet the
water use requirements of the occupants of the subdivision. The amount of water rights required
shall be determined as follows:
a. Residential Uses. Amount based on the total lot area of the subdivision and the number of
lots within the subdivision, in accordance with the following formula:
Water Right Requirement (in acre feet) = 1.66 x area in lots (in acres) + .45 x number of
lots.
b. Other Users. An amount sufficient to satisfy the projected needs of the proposed
development, as determined by Alpine City.
2. Rate of Flow. In addition to the annual quantity of water, determined in accordance with Part 1,
the water rights conveyed to the City shall entitle the owner to divert the water at a rate of flow
sufficient to meet the demands imposed for peak use during the summer months of July and
August.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://alpine.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=4_Subdivision_Ordinance 43/66
3. Type of Water Rights Acceptable For Conveyance. Water rights proposed for conveyance to
the City shall be of a type which allow for municipal use within the City, or, if not, the water rights
must be of the type which can be amended to provide for municipal use in accordance with the
procedures of Utah's change application statute, Utah Code Ann. ' 73-3-3. The developer shall
make application to the State Engineer and shall pay all costs associated with the application.
The water rights may include one or a combination of the following as recommended by the City
Engineer to the Planning Commission, and a recommendation by the Planning Commission to
the Alpine City Council with the final determination to be made by the City Council.
a. Alpine Irrigation Company Stock.
Primary Shares - One-third (1/3) share for each acre foot of water right required.
Secondary Shares - One full share for each acre foot required.
b. Other irrigation water stock or water rights sufficient water rights to equal the number of
acre feet required for the proposed development, after any reduction in quantity by the
State Engineer.
c. Well Rights. The right to divert from a well source. These water rights shall be evidenced
by an approved application to appropriate, an underground water claim or court decree.
d. Previously Conveyed Rights. Assignment of interest in water shares or credits to the use
of water which have been previously conveyed to the City in anticipation of development
(e.g., Busch Well).
e. Cash. The City may determine that cash may be given in lieu of other water rights for the
purpose of developing new water sources. The cash amount shall be determined by
taking the number of shares required times the current market value of Alpine Irrigation
Company shares multiplied by 125%.
Prior to acceptance of water rights, the City shall evaluate the rights proposed for
conveyance and may refuse to accept any right which it determines to be insufficient in
annual quantity or flow rate, or not reasonably likely to be approved for change to
municipal purposes within the City by the State Engineer. In determining the quantity of
water available under the water rights, the City will evaluate the priority of the water rights
and the historic average quantities of water available to the water rights.
4. Supply and Delivery Facilities May Be Required. In addition to furnishing water rights, the
subdivider/owner may be required to pay all costs required to construct the needed facilities to
supply, store and distribute the water in accordance with the culinary waterworks system
component of the Alpine City Capital Improvements Plan as reflected in Ordinance No. 93-09
and any subsequent amendments thereto; the adequate public facilities requirement at adopted
level of services standards as established by the Alpine City Construction Standards reflected in
the Subdivision Ordinance pursuant to Ordinance No.93-10 and any subsequent amendments
thereto; and the studies and analysis with respect to the Alpine City culinary waterworks system
which were part of the Alpine City impact fee study; and the adoption of the connection and
impact fees for the culinary waterworks system. Items of construction may include, but are not
necessarily limited to, wells, storage reservoirs, spring development, pressure regulating
stations, booster pumping stations, distribution lines, etc.
5. Status of Previously Conveyed Water Rights. All water rights previously conveyed as part of
the annexation process shall be considered as a credit toward satisfying the requirements of this
section.

6. Adjustments to Water Conveyance Requirements Permitted Under Certain Circumstances.
Where the subdivision contains lands where, as a result of topographic features (e.g., steep
slopes) or other environmentally sensitive or fragile conditions, the availability of irrigation water
for use on the lot, or other conditions, will be permanently restricted from any use or activity
requiring the use of water from the City's culinary water system, the City may reduce the amount
or water rights required to be conveyed in an amount commensurate with the portion of the lot so
restricted against the use of water. Any request for reduction shall include enforceable provisions
for securing the restricted condition in a form to be approved by Alpine City.
7. City May Purchase Surplus Water Rights. In the event that the quantity of water available
under the water rights historically used on the parcel proposed for the development is greater
than that required to meet the water rights conveyance requirement, the City shall have the right
of first refusal to purchase the surplus shares of water rights.
8. Time of Conveyance. The conveyance of title to the water rights, free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances and claims of any nature, shall occur prior to, or concurrent with, or as a condition
of the final plat by the City Council, at or before the time of plat recordation.

9. Hardship Relief Provisions
a. Hardship Relief Petition. Any applicant for subdivision approval, either prior to or
concurrent with the submission of an application for approval of a preliminary design plan
or preliminary plat, may file a hardship relief petition with the City Recorder seeking relief
from all or a part of the water rights acquisition policy requirements as contained in this
ordinance on the basis that the requirements, as applied to the applicant or the specific
property for which development approval is being requested, has no reasonable
relationship to the needs created or benefits conferred upon the proposed development,
does not demonstrably benefit the proposed development, is duplicative, results in the
deprivation of all reasonable use of the property, or is otherwise unlawful pursuant to the
standards of applicable case law or statutes then in effect.
b. Economic Hardship Standard. For the purposes of this ordinance, a substantial economic
hardship shall be defined as applying the requirements of the water rights acquisition
policy in such a manner that it has no reasonable relationship to the needs created or
benefits conferred upon the proposed development, does not demonstrably benefit the
proposed development, is duplicative, results in the deprivation of all reasonable use of
the property, or is otherwise unlawful pursuant to the standards of applicable case law or
statutes then in effect. The Planning Commission and City Council shall not find a
substantial economic hardship if such a hardship is self imposed. The mere fact that the
land or parcel of property in question has not historically had water rights associated with
it is not a sufficient basis to determine the existence of a substantial economic hardship.
The City Council may not modify or grant the petitioner relief from any of the provisions of
the Alpine City water rights acquisition policy unless it finds that granting the petition will
not substantially affect the General Plan, will not be contrary to the public interest, and will
not undermine the ability of Alpine City to provide water rights in a sufficient amount to
meet the reasonable needs of its residents for culinary, irrigation, fire protection and other
purposes.

https://alpine.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=4_Subdivision_Ordinance 52/66

required improvements and guaranteeing and warranting all improvements for a one-year period
commencing upon the final inspection of said improvements by the City. Said guarantee shall meet the
following requirements:
1. Type and Amount of Guarantee. The type of guarantee shall be in the form of a performance
bond for an amount not less than ONE HUNDRED TEN PERCENT (110%) of the cost of the
required improvements, as determined by the City. The subdivider shall furnish an estimate of
the cost of constructing the required improvements. Said estimate shall be prepared by an
engineer registered to practice in the State of Utah and approved by the City Engineer.
2. Duration. Said performance bond shall begin at the time the bond is obtained and shall
terminate at such time as all improvements pass the warranty inspection at the end of the oneyear
warranty period which commences upon the final inspection of the improvements by the
City, or until such earlier time as the City Council may decide.
3. Default. In the event the subdivider is in default or fails or neglects to satisfactorily install the
required improvements within one year from the date of approval of the final plat by the City
Council, or to pay all liens in connection therewith, or the required improvements do not pass

represent the TEN PERCENT (10%) of said performance bond. If the condition of materials or
workmanship shows unusual depreciation or does not comply with standards of the City, or if any
outstanding liens are not paid, the City Administrator may declare the subdivider in default. At the
end of the one-year warranty and guarantee period, the City Engineer and authorized
representative shall make a warranty inspection of the improvements and shall submit a report to
the City Council setting forth the condition of such improvements. If the improvements are found

There is an underlying policy in Alpine City strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters
involving Constitutional Taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and
in view of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issued. At the same
time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the
public's right to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the Constitution. Consistent
with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve
the issue of a Constitutional Taking. These provisions are to assist governments in considering
decisions that may involve Constitutional Takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be
provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This ordinance is further intended and shall be
construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a specific government action should
require payment of just compensation, yet preserve the ability of Alpine City to lawfully regulate real
property and fulfill its other duties and functions.

(Ord. 95-07, 3/29/95). It is intended that land annexed into the City be accompanied by water rights in an
amount sufficient to satisfy the needs of the existing and future occupants of the annexed territory. The
water rights conveyance requirements of this section shall be considered as a condition and requirement
of annexation.
(Ord. 97-01 7/27/97)
5.11.010 Water Rights Required; Determination Of Amount
Any person annexing land into the City shall, as a condition of annexation, convey to the City water
rights that entitle the owner to an annual quantity and rate of flow in an amount which is sufficient to
meet the water use requirements of the proposed future development. The amount of water rights
required shall be determined as follows:
1. Residential Uses. Sufficient water rights to satisfy the water use requirements of each lot as
shown on the proposed development plan for the territory within the annexation area in
accordance with the following formula:
Water Right Requirement (in acre feet) = (1.66) area in lots (in acres) + (.45) Number of lots
2. Other Users. An amount sufficient to satisfy the projected needs of the proposed development,
as determined by Alpine City.
3. Rate of Flow. In addition to the annual quantity of water, determined in accordance with Parts 1
or 2, the water rights conveyed to the City shall entitle the owner to divert the water at a rate of
flow sufficient to meet the demands imposed for peak use during the summer months of July and
August.
NOTE: The above requirements are based on the results of the 1994 Alpine City Water Use Study by
Horrocks Engineers and reflected in an amendment to the Alpine City General Plan adopting a water
rights acquisition policy.
(Ord. 97-01 7/27/97)
5.11.020 Type Of Water Right Acceptable For Conveyance
Water rights proposed for conveyance to the City shall be of a type which allow for municipal use within
the City, or, if not, the water rights must be of the type which can be amended to provide for municipal
use in accordance with the procedures of Utah's change application statute, Utah Code Ann. section 73-
3-3. The water rights may include one or a combination of the following:
1. Alpine Irrigation Company Stock
Primary Shares - One-third share for each acre-foot of water right required.
Secondary Shares - One full share for each acre-foot required.
2. Other irrigation water stock or water rights. Sufficient water rights to equal the number of acre
feet required for the proposed development, after any reduction in quantity by the State
Engineer.
3. Well Rights. The right to divert from a well source. These water rights shall be evidenced by an
approved application to appropriate, an underground clamor court decree.
4. Previously Conveyed Rights. Assignment of interest in water shares or credits to the use of
water which have been previously conveyed to the City in anticipation of development (e.g.,
Busch Well).

https://alpine.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=5_Annexations 5/6
Prior to acceptance of water rights, the City shall evaluate the rights proposed for conveyance and may
refuse to accept any right which it determines to be insufficient in annual quantity or flow rate, or not
reasonably likely to be approved for change to municipal purposes within the City by the State Engineer.
In determining the quantity of water available under the water rights, the City will evaluate the priority of
the water rights and the historic average quantities of water available to the water rights.
(Ord. 97-01 7/27/97)
5.11.030 Supply And Delivery Facilities May Be Required
In addition to furnishing water rights, the applicant may be required to pay all costs required to construct
the needed facilities to supply, store and distribute the water in accordance with the culinary waterworks
system component of the Alpine City Capital Improvements Plan as reflected in ordinance No. 93-09
and any subsequent amendments thereto; the adequate public facilities requirement at adopted level of
service standards as established by the Alpine City Construction Standards reflected in the subdivision
ordinance pursuant to Ordinance No. 93-10 and any subsequent amendments thereto; and the studies
and analysis with respect to the Alpine City culinary waterworks system which were part of the Alpine
City impact fee study; and the adoption of connection and impact fees for the culinary waterworks
system. Items of construction may include, but are not necessarily limited to, wells, storage reservoirs,
spring development, pressure regulating stations, booster pumping stations, distribution lines, etc.
(Ord. 97-01 7/27/97)
5.11.040 Adjustments To Water Conveyance Requirements Permitted Under Certain
Circumstances
1. Territory Conveyed to City at Time of Annexation. In determining the amount of water right
required to be conveyed, any territory conveyed to the City for a major street or other public
purpose as required pursuant to the terms of the policy declaration or Annexation Ordinance,
prior to recording the annexation plat shall be excluded.
2. Lands Which are Restricted Against Future Development. Where the annexation contains lands
where, as a result of topographic extremes (e.g., steep slopes) or other environmentally sensitive
or fragile conditions, the availability of existing irrigation water and facilities for use on the
property, voluntary limitation by the applicant or other similar purposes, will be permanently
restricted from uses or activities requiring the use of water from the City's culinary system, the
City may reduce the amount of water right required to be conveyed in an amount commensurate
with the portion of the area so restricted against the use of water. Any request for reduction shall
include enforceable provisions for securing the restricted condition in a form to be approved by
Alpine City.
3. Lands Owned by Non-Signatory Owners. Whenever land is annexed without the consent of the
owner, the conveyance of water rights by the non-signatory owners will not be required at the
time of annexation provided, however, that the resolution or ordinance annexing the territory shall
note all parcels annexed without the owner's consent and shall provide that future development
of these lands will require the conveyance of water rights prior to the granting of any approval of
development or the issuance of a building permit. The City may also file a notice of interest to
that effect in the office of the County Recorder and maintain a map showing all parcels which
have been annexed without satisfying the water rights requirements.
