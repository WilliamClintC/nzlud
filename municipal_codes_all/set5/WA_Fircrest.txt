2.44.170 Paid sick leave.

(a) All regular full-time and regular part-time employees, whether paid on an hourly basis or by monthly salary, shall be entitled to sick leave as follows: all full‐time regular employees accrue paid sick leave benefits at the rate of eight hours for each calendar month of continuous employment; regular part‐time, casual and seasonal employees accrue sick leave prorated to their full‐time equivalent status. All employees accrue at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked. Sick leave shall be granted at the rate of eight hours for each calendar month of service. Regular part-time employees may be granted a pro rata rate for each calendar month of service. Employees are entitled to use their accrued, unused paid sick leave beginning on the ninetieth calendar day after the start of their employment.

(b) Sick leave granted and not used shall accrue to the credit of each such employee, up to a maximum total accumulation of 1,940 hours. Accrued sick leave shall be canceled upon termination of employment. In the event any person having accrued sick leave ceases to be employed by the city and is thereafter reemployed, the accrued sick leave of the employee shall not be reinstated, and the employee shall thereafter accrue sick leave in the same manner as if a new employee.

(c) Employees entitled to sick leave may remain away from work with pay, where such absence is the result of personal illness or physical incapacity not job connected, sickness of an immediate family member as defined by RCW 49.46.210, involuntary or enforced quarantine, or death in the immediate family of such employee. Sick leave granted because of death in the immediate family shall not exceed three days unless other arrangements have been approved by the city manager. An employee who is collecting worker’s compensation temporary disability benefits as a result of an on-the-job injury shall receive sick leave benefits to supplement such worker’s compensation benefits in an amount sufficient to equal the employee’s regular rate of pay during the period of temporary disability; provided, however, such supplementary benefits shall not be paid in excess of the accrued sick leave credited to the employee.

(d) Sick Leave Sharing.

(1) Definition. A “medical condition, illness or injury” shall be defined as:

(A) A physician certified eminent case; or

(B) A medical condition, illness, injury of an extraordinary or severe nature and which has caused, or is likely to cause, the employee to:

(i) Go on leave of absence without pay; or

(ii) Terminate city employment; but shall not include any mental, emotional or stress-related medical condition, illness, claims or injuries, except for periods during hospitalization or institutional interment.

(2) Authorization. The city manager may permit a regular full-time or regular part-time employee to receive sick leave donations from other qualified employees under this subsection if the condition meets the definition as provided herein, and if:

(E) The employee has diligently pursued and been found to be ineligible for state industrial insurance benefits or disability insurance benefits.

(3) The city manager shall determine the amount of sick leave which an employee may receive under this section. However, an employee shall not receive, in donations, a total of more than 349 hours of donated sick leave.

(4) Donated sick leave shall be utilized in the order of receipt by the city manager. Such leave shall be donated in eight-hour increments. In the instance where an illness or injury qualifies an employee for state workers’ compensation, the employer’s access to shared sick leave shall only be for the difference between the employee’s straight-time base hourly wage and the amount paid the employee by the state workers’ compensation benefits, to the extent of available shared sick leave, if any.

(5) An employee who has accrued a sick leave balance of more than 192 hours may request that the city manager transfer a specified amount of sick leave to another employee authorized to receive sick leave under this section. In no event may the employee request a transfer of an amount of sick leave that would result in his or her own sick leave account going below 192 hours.

(6) The amount of sick leave time transferred under this section which remains unused shall be returned to the employee or employees who transferred the leave when the city manager finds that the leave is no longer needed or will not be needed at a future time in connection with the illness or injury for which the leave was transferred. (Ord. 1636 § 6, 2019; Ord. 1155 § 9, 1997; Ord. 1018 § 3, 1993; Ord. 995 § 17, 1991).

No person in the classified civil service who has been permanently appointed or inducted into civil service under provisions of this chapter shall be removed, suspended, or demoted except for cause, and only upon written accusation of the appointing power or any citizen or taxpayer; a written statement of which accusation, in general terms, shall be served upon the accused, and a duplicate filed with the commission. Any person so removed, suspended, or demoted may, within 10 days from the time of his removal, suspension, or demotion, file with the commission a written demand for an investigation, whereupon the commission shall conduct such investigation. The investigation shall be confined to the determination of the question of whether the removal, suspension, or demotion was made in good faith for cause. After such investigation the commission may affirm the removal, or if it finds that removal, suspension or demotion was not made in good faith for cause, the commission shall order the immediate reinstatement or re-employment of such person in the office, place, position, or employment from which he was removed, suspended, or demoted, which reinstatement shall, if the commission so provides, be retroactive, and entitle such person to pay or compensation from the time of the removal, suspension, or demotion. The commission, upon such investigation, in lieu of affirming a removal, may modify the order by directing a suspension without pay for a given period, and subsequent restoration to duty, or demotion in classification, grade, or pay. The findings of the commission shall be certified, in writing, to the appointing power, and shall be forthwith enforced by such officer.

All investigations made by the commission pursuant to this section shall be by public hearing, after reasonable notice to the accused of the time and place thereof, at which hearing, the accused shall be afforded an opportunity to appear in person and by counsel, and present his defense. The subpoena provisions of FMC 2.56.060(c) shall apply to all such hearings. If the order of removal, suspension, or demotion is concurred in by the commission or a majority thereof, the accused may appeal therefrom to the superior court of the county wherein he resides. Such appeal shall be taken by serving the commission, within 30 days after the entry of its order, a written notice of appeal, stating the grounds thereof, and demanding that a certified transcript of the record and of all papers on file in the office of the commission affecting or relating to its order be filed by the commission with the court. The commission shall, within 10 days after the filing of the notice, make, certify, and file such transcript with the court. The court shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine such appeal in a summary manner; provided, however, that such hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether the judgment or order of removal, discharge, demotion or suspension made by the commission was or was not made in good faith for cause, and no appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such ground or grounds. (Ord. 714 § 10, 1978).


2.56.120 Classified civil service – Authority to create offices and positions. 

All offices, places, positions, and employments coming within the purview of this chapter shall be created by the person or group of persons, who, acting singly or in conjunction, as a city manager or city council, or otherwise, is vested by the ordinance of the city with power and authority to select, appoint, or employ any person coming within the purview of this chapter, and nothing contained in this chapter shall infringe upon the power and authority of any such person or group of persons, or appointing power, to fix the salaries and compensation of all employees employed under this chapter.

If there is no appropriate eligibility list for the class, the commission shall certify the names of the three persons standing highest on said list held appropriate for such class. If more than one vacancy is to be filled, two additional names shall be certified for each such additional vacancy. The appointing power shall forthwith appoint a person or persons from the names certified to such vacant position.

Whenever requisition is to be made, or whenever a position is held by a temporary appointee and an eligibility list for the class of such person exists, the commission shall forthwith certify the names of the three persons standing highest on said list eligible for appointment to the appointing power and said appointing power shall forthwith appoint from the names certified a person so certified to said position.

To enable the appointing power to exercise a choice in the filling of positions, no appointment, employment or promotion in any position in the classified civil service shall be deemed complete until after the expiration of a period of three to six months’ probationary service, as may be provided in the rules of the commission during which the appointing power may terminate the employment of the person certified to him, and if during the performance test thus afforded, upon observation or consideration of the performance of duty, the appointing power deems him unfit or unsatisfactory for service in the department, the appointing power shall designate another person from the eligibility list, and such other person shall likewise enter upon said duties until some person is found who is deemed fit for employment or promotion for the probationary period provided therefor, whereupon the appointment, employment or promotion shall be deemed to be complete.

(Ord. 714 § 13, 1978).


2.56.150 Classified civil service – Leave of absence.

Leave of absence without pay may be granted by the appointing power to any person under civil service; provided, that such appointing power shall give notice of such leave to the commission.

No public officer, whether elected or public, shall discharge, promote, demote, or in any manner change the official rank, employment or compensation of any person under civil service, or promise or threaten to do so, for giving or withholding, or neglecting to make any contribution of money, or services, or any other valuable thing, for any political purpose.

2.60.010 Findings.

(a) RCW 42.17.260 requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of all public records.

(b) The RCW also states that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, or interfere with agency operation, a city must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

(c) When such an order is made, all indexes maintained by that city must be made available to provide identifying information on those records, which are available for inspection and/or copying.

(d) The city of Fircrest is comprised of eight departments, their divisions and subdivisions, which maintain separate record-keeping systems for the indexing of records and information.

(e) Because the city has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems and databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a central index of records. 

(f) The city will fully comply with the provisions of the RCW as they relate to the Public Disclosure Act under Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 1344 § 1, 2004).


2.60.020 Order regarding public records index.

(a) The city of Fircrest is not required to maintain an all-inclusive index of public records, due to findings of the city council that the requirement is unduly burdensome and such a list is nearly impossible to create and/or maintain. 

(b) The city of Fircrest shall make available all public records and any indexes created for internal use upon request by any citizen. Said indexes shall be maintained and released in order to obtain those records which are public and not protected by the exemption portion of the statute, namely RCW 42.17.310.

(b) RCW 39.30.045, Permits to Purchase, Auction, Closeout, Bankruptcy Sales. If an authorized purchasing coordinator determines that supplies, material, or equipment can be purchased at any public auction, closeout sale, bankruptcy sale or other similar sale, and makes a finding that a purchase at any such auction or sale will be made at a cost below market cost, the city manager may authorize said purchases.

(c) Exchanges. The city may by agreement exchange supplies, materials or equipment with other public agencies.

(d) Interlocal Agreements in Letting of Contracts for Commodities or Services.

In the event that an emergency should arise after office hours, which emergency requires immediate action on the part of the city department involved for the protection of the best interests of the city, or should such a situation arise on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday and where it is not possible or convenient to reach the city manager, any necessary purchase shall be made by the city department for which the purchase is necessary.

Such bidders may be subject to possible exclusion from future bidding with the city when determined by the city manager to be in the best interest of the city.

(b) Disclosure of Formal Bid Contents. Any disclosure in advance of opening bids, of any information contained in the sealed or formal bid, made or permitted by a city officer or employee may render each bid void either by the city or the parties submitting bids. Appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against both the persons revealing the information and the persons using the information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all bids submitted by bidders taking advantage of any information revealed contrary to this section shall at once become null and void.

(Ord. 1127 § 1, 1996).


3.12.090 Disposition of public property. 

(a) Definition. “Public property” as defined herein means any property or equity interest in real or personal property held or owned by the city except for mortgages taken or released to secure the installation of development improvements.

(b) Surplus Property. Upon recommendation of the department head, the city manager may declare property surplus upon one or more of the following criteria:

(1) The city has or soon will have no practical, efficient, or appropriate use for the property, nor will it have such a use for the property in the near future.

(2) The purpose served by the property can be accomplished by use of a better, less costly, or more efficient alternative.

(3) The purpose served by the property or its use no longer exists as determined by a change of policy evidenced by an ordinance or resolution of the city council.

(4) The property is damaged, worn out, otherwise inoperable and the cost of repairing the same is unwise or impractical.

(c) Sale of Property.

(1) If a department head or authorized city representative has city property under his or her control or supervision which is deemed surplus to use, said employee shall notify the city manager, who shall in turn notify interested department heads, supervisors or other city representatives and give them an opportunity to review their need for the same. If any of such persons desire to acquire and use the proposed surplus property, unless the manager disagrees, the property may be transferred to the requesting department head, or other authorized representative.

(2) If no request for use of proposed surplus property is received, the city manager may then proceed to direct the disposal of the same by public auction, bid or other method of sale on terms the manager deems to be in the best interest of the city.

(3) Surplus personal property which is unsalable because of obsolescence, wear and tear, or other reasons may be dismantled, if necessary, and sold as scrap.

(4) If the proposed surplus property is real property, notice of the proposal to declare the same surplus shall additionally be given to all city councilmembers.

(5) The decision to declare surplus real property shall rest solely with the city council. If the city council votes to declare the real property as surplus, the city manager shall secure an independent fee appraisal of the property. The city council shall then determine by resolution the procedure for sale of the property by any one of the following options:

(A) By public auction; or

(B) Through the formal bidding procedures set forth in FMC 3.12.040 as the manager deems to be in the best interest of the city; or

(C) By resolution, council may approve a negotiated disposition of real property, or provide for the conditions of disposition of any such properties.

(d) Trade of Real Property.

(1) If the city manager determines that the real property declared surplus under this section could be sold for a greater consideration or benefit to the city if something other than cash were taken as consideration, then the manager may invite prospective purchasers to tender consideration either cash or in-kind or a combination of both. Upon receipt of a bid tendering consideration in-kind, and if the manager considers such bid to be the best offer made, prior to accepting such a bid the manager shall make a report setting forth reasons for thinking the in-kind bid has the most value to the city. This report shall be made to the city council at a regular council meeting and the report shall remain open to public inspection.

(2) Before accepting any bid containing in-kind consideration, an adequate appraisal must have been made by a qualified independent appraiser.

(3) If the city council finds that the bid containing the in-kind consideration has more value or benefit to the city than any other bid submitted, the manager may accept the bid containing in-kind consideration.

(e) Lease of Public Property. When specifically provided for in the city budget, the city manager may authorize the lease or sublease of any property, including real property, under such terms and conditions as the manager may deem desirable, fair and appropriate, either by use of negotiations or bidding in the best interest of the city. Leases of real property shall not be granted for a period of more than five years. (Ord. 1329 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1127 § 1, 1996).

The city manager may suspend a license for no more than six months to allow for the business to return to compliance. During the period of any suspension, all business activity shall cease.

(Ord. 1156 § 17, 1997).


5.04.180 Appeals.

An applicant or licensee under this chapter must appeal the decision for revocation, suspension or denial within 10 days of the mailing of the notice of revocation, suspension or denial by filing a notice of appeal with the city manager.

5.04.220 Nonconforming uses. 

A license does not constitute vesting nor ratification of a nonconforming use. The purpose of this chapter is to identify and license businesses which are active in the city. Identification is necessary to protect public health, safety, and the welfare of the community. The issuance of a business license by the city does not constitute either approval of a business or the use of any particular parcel in the city for a business purpose. By issuing a business license, the city shall not be precluded from taking enforcement action against any use which is not authorized in the zone in which it is occurring. The procurement of a business license does not vest the license with any rights to continue a nonconforming use. (Ord. 1156 § 22, 1997).

The person must provide all information requested by the animal control authority and finance department of the city of Tacoma and must comply with all restrictions imposed by the animal control authority. There is no right to bring into the city a dog that has been the subject of a declaration or similar process in another jurisdiction and the animal control authority will determine whether such a dog will be licensed and permitted to reside in the city.

(2) If the animal control authority determines that the dog’s behavior that led to another jurisdiction’s determination that the dog is potentially dangerous, dangerous, vicious, or similar designation would lead to a declaration as a dangerous dog under the municipal code in effect at the time of the proposed move, it shall not permit the dog to be licensed or to remain in the city and shall notify the dog’s owner, either personally or via mail at the address provided by the owner.

(3) Any person knowingly bringing a dog into the city or failing to remove a dog from the city after the animal control authority has notified the person that the dog is not allowed in the city is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

(a) The sections of adopted RCW as set forth in this title, as now enacted or hereinafter amended, are hereby adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein, including penalties; except that conduct constituting a felony, as determined by the prosecutor, is excluded. In opting to adopt state statutes by reference in this title, only those crimes and offenses within the jurisdiction of the city are intended to be adopted and in those sections adopted which deal with both misdemeanors and felonies, only the language applicable to misdemeanors is to be applied.

(b) If any section, subsection, sentence, or provision of this chapter, or its application to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter, or the application of the section, subsection, sentence, or provision to other persons or circumstances, is not affected, and to this end, the sections, subsections, sentences, and provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable.

(c) By adopting state statues, the city intends to assume jurisdiction over and become the jurisdictional authority for the enforcement and prosecution of misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor crimes. Whenever the word “state” shall appear in any statute adopted by reference in this chapter, the word “city” shall be substituted therefor; provided, however, the term “city” shall not be substituted for the term “state” in those circumstances that set forth administrative or licensing duties of the state and its subdivisions.

(d) Whenever a state statute specifically adopted in this chapter refers to another state statute not specifically adopted in this chapter, the statute referred to shall be given the force and effect necessary to enforce the statute specifically adopted in this chapter.

(e) Any section of this chapter that is repealed or amended by ordinance shall remain in full force and effect until the effective date of the ordinance repealing or amending the section. Any state statute that is adopted by reference which is later amended, repealed, or recodified shall remain in full force and effect until the effective date of the legislative act that repeals, recodifies, or amends the state statute. The amendment or recodification of any state statute adopted in this chapter shall be given its full force and effect upon the effective date of its amendment or recodification.

(f) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any person violating this title shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

(g) Each separate day during which any violation occurs or continues shall be deemed to constitute a separate violation thereof and a separate offense thereunder. (Ord. 1402 § 1, 2006; Ord. 524 § 1(b), 1965).


9.04.030 Definitions.

For the purpose of this title, the following words shall have the following meanings unless the context indicates otherwise:

“Dependant child” means any child under 18 years of age who is found under the conditions, in the state, in the company of or engaged in the activities described as constituting a dependant child in the laws of the state of Washington relating to juvenile courts and delinquents or as further described or defined by the Fircrest Municipal Code or any city ordinance.

“Delinquent child” means any child less than 18 years of age who violates any law of this state, the Fircrest Municipal Code or any ordinance of this city, or who habitually uses vile, obscene, vulgar or indecent language or is guilty of immoral conduct.

“Law enforcement officer,” as defined by RCW 10.93.020 as now enacted or hereinafter amended, is hereby adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein.

“Minor” means any person under the age of 18.

“Person” means and includes natural persons of either sex, associations, copartnerships, and corporations, whether acting by themselves or by servant, agent or employee. The singular number shall, when necessary, be held and construed to include the plural, and the masculine pronoun to include the feminine.

“Public officer” means police officers, fire chief, health officer, street, sewer and water superintendents and engineer or their duly authorized deputies, when performing the functions of any said officers.

“RCW” means Revised Code of Washington.

“Statute” means a statute of the Revised Code of Washington. (Ord. 1402 § 2, 2006; Ord. 524 § 1(c), 1965).


9.04.040 Reimbursements of costs. 

(a) Upon conviction of an offense under any section of this penal code, or section of this municipal code or any other city ordinance:

(1) The court may require a convicted defendant to pay costs. For the purpose of this section, whenever the court has levied a fine or assessed costs against a corporation or unincorporated association, the person or persons authorized to make disbursements from the assets of said organization shall be deemed to be the defendant.

(2) Costs shall be limited to expenses specially incurred by the city in prosecuting the defendant, including but not limited to the expenses of providing the defendant with assistance of counsel. Offenders may be required to pay for the actual cost of their incarceration, if the court determines that the offender, at the time of sentencing, has the means to pay for the cost of incarceration. Offenders may be required to pay to the city reimbursement for their jail booking fee per the rate established in RCW 70.48.390, as now enacted or hereinafter amended. Payment of all other court-ordered financial obligations, however, shall take precedent over the payment of the cost of incarceration ordered by the court. Funds recovered from offenders will go to the city. Costs shall not include expenditures in connection with the maintenance and operation of government agencies that must be made by public irrespective of specific violations of law.

(3) The court shall not sentence a defendant to pay costs unless the defendant is or will be able to pay them. In determining the amount and method of payment of costs, the court shall take account of the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose.

(4) A defendant who has been sentenced to pay costs, and who is not in contumacious default in the payment thereof, may at any time petition the court which sentenced him for modification of the payment of costs or of any unpaid portion thereof. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or his immediate family, the court may modify all or part of the amount due in costs, or modify the method of payment as provided in this section.

(b) Time Allowed for Payment. When a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine or costs, the court may grant permission for payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. If no such permission is included in the sentence, the fine or costs shall be payable forthwith. A time pay assessment/fee may be imposed by the court for a time payment plan.

(c) Default. When a defendant sentenced to pay a fine or costs defaults in the payment thereof, or of any installment, the court, on motion of the city attorney or upon its own motion, may require the defendant to show cause why the default should not be treated as contempt of court, and may issue a show-cause summons or a warrant of arrest for the defendant’s appearance.

(1) If the court finds the default was attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on the defendant’s part to make a good faith effort to make the payment, the court may find that the defendant is in contempt of court and may order the defendant’s commitment until the fine or costs, or a specified part thereof, is paid.

(2) The term of imprisonment for contempt for nonpayment of a fine or costs shall be set forth in the commitment order, and shall not exceed one day for each $50.00 of the fine or costs or fraction thereof, or 30 days, whichever is the shorter period. The court shall specify in its commitment order the rate of pay at which the defendant shall be given credit towards payment of the fine or costs.

(3) If the court finds that the default is not contempt, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time to pay the fine or costs of any installment thereof, and/or the court may revoke the fine or costs in whole or in part.

(4) A default in the payment of a fine or costs or any installment thereof may be collected by any means authorized by law for the enforcement of a judgment. The levy of execution for the collection of a fine or costs shall not discharge a defendant committed to imprisonment for contempt until the amount of the fine or costs has actually been collected. The defendant will be responsible for any collection costs/fees. (Ord. 1402 § 6, 2006; Ord. 524 § 1(d), 1965).

(b) Any person so redeeming a vehicle impounded by the city shall pay the towing contractor for costs of impoundment removal, towing and storage prior to redeeming such vehicle, except as provided for by subsection (c) of this section. Such towing contractor shall accept payment as provided in RCW 46.55.120(1)(b) as now or hereafter amended. If the vehicle was impounded pursuant to FMC 9.10.010 and was being operated by the registered owner when it was impounded, it may not be released to any person until all penalties, fines or forfeitures owed by the registered owner have been satisfied.

(c) The Fircrest municipal court is authorized to release a vehicle impounded pursuant to FMC 9.10.010(c) to (g) prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment upon petition of the registered owner or the spouse of the driver based on economic or personal hardship to such registered owner or spouse resulting from the unavailability of the vehicle and after consideration of the threat to public safety that may result from release of the vehicle including, but not limited to, the driver’s criminal history, driving record, license status, and access to the vehicle. If such release is authorized, the person redeeming the vehicle still must satisfy the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded as a result of a traffic citation has a right to a Fircrest municipal court hearing to contest the validity of an impoundment or the amount of removal, towing, and storage charges if such request for hearing is in writing, in a form approved by the Fircrest municipal court and signed by such person, and is received by the Fircrest municipal court within 10 days (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the date the notice was given to such person by the registered tow truck operator pursuant to RCW 46.55.120(2)(a). Such hearing shall be provided as follows:

(1) If all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under FMC 9.10.010 have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall be released immediately and a hearing as provided for in FMC 9.10.030 shall be held within 90 days of the written request for hearing.

(2) If not all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under FMC 9.10.010, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall not be released until after the hearing provided pursuant to FMC 9.10.030, which shall be held within five business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the written request to the court for hearing.

(3) Any person seeking a hearing who has failed to request such hearing within the time specified in subsection (d) of this section may petition the Fircrest municipal court for an extension of time to file a request for hearing. Such extension shall only be granted upon the demonstration of good cause as to the reason(s) the request for hearing was not timely filed. For the purposes of this section, “good cause” shall be defined as circumstances beyond the control of the person seeking the hearing that prevented such person from filing a timely request for hearing. In the event such extension is granted, the person receiving such extension shall be granted a hearing in accordance with this chapter.

(4) If a person fails to file a timely request for hearing and no extension to file such a request has been granted, the right to a hearing is waived, the impoundment and the associated costs of impoundment are deemed to be proper, and the city shall not be liable for removal, towing, and storage charges arising from the impoundment.

(5) When a driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 and the driver is a registered owner of the vehicle, the impounded vehicle may not be redeemed within a 12-hour period following the time the impounded vehicle arrives at the registered tow truck operator’s storage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator’s master log, unless there are two or more registered owners of the vehicle or there is a legal owner of the vehicle that is not the driver of the vehicle. A registered owner who is not the driver of the vehicle or a legal owner who is not the driver of the vehicle may redeem the impounded vehicle after it arrives at the registered tow truck operator’s storage facility as noted in the registered tow truck operator’s master log. (Ord. 1511 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1221 § 1, 1999; Ord. 1217 § 2, 1999).


9.10.030 Post-impoundment hearing procedure. 

Hearings requested pursuant to FMC 9.10.020 shall be held in the Fircrest municipal court, which court shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated removal, towing, and/or storage fees were proper.

(a) At the hearing, an abstract of the driver’s driving record is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the status of the driver’s license, permit, or privilege to drive and that the driver was convicted of each offense shown on the abstract. In addition, a certified vehicle registration of the impounded vehicle is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle.

(b) If the impoundment is found to be proper, the court shall enter an order so stating. In the event that the costs of impoundment, removal, towing, and storage have not been paid or any other applicable requirements of FMC 9.10.020(a) and (b) have not been satisfied or any period of impoundment under FMC 9.10.010 has not expired, the court’s order shall also provide that the impounded vehicle shall be released only after payment to the city of any fines imposed on any underlying traffic citation or parking infraction and satisfaction of any other applicable requirements of FMC 9.10.020(a) and (b).

(c) If the impoundment is found to be improper, the court shall enter an order so stating and order the immediate release of the vehicle. If the costs of impoundment have already been paid, the court shall enter judgment against the city and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment in the amount of the costs of the impoundment.

(d) In the event that the court finds that the impound was proper, but that the removal, towing, storage fees charged for the impoundment were improper, the court shall determine the correct fees to be charged. If the costs of impoundment have been paid, the court shall enter a judgment against the city and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment for the amount of the overpayment.

(e) No determination of facts made at a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution and such determination shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

(f) As to any impoundment arising from an alleged violation of RCW 46.20.342 or 46.20.420, if it is determined to be improper, then the law enforcement officer directing the impoundment and the government employing the officer are not liable for damages if the officer relied in good faith and without gross negligence on the records of the department in ascertaining that the operator of the vehicle had a suspended or revoked driver’s license. (Ord. 1217 § 3, 1999).

(c) Properties which: (1) have frontage on a perimeter roadway defined in subsection (a) of this section; and (2) have vehicular access to the perimeter roadway only via a roadway as defined in subsection (b) of this section, e.g., Flora Drive, may be numbered in accordance with the Pierce County grid as a perimeter roadway and addressed on the roadway defined in subsection (b) of this section if the city council determines that such numbering and addressing will render the property easier to locate.

(l) Established roadway names will be extended to and through new additions regardless of whether the roadway is continuous, unless the city council determines that an alternative name will not be detrimental to the effective and timely provision of emergency medical and law enforcement services.

(m) On short roadways where all houses have frontage on another roadway, the short roadway will not be named and corner houses will be numbered on a named roadway.

(n) Except as provided below, all streets, avenues, boulevards, ways, places, drives, lanes, parkways and other roadway categories will be named. Streets located within areas annexed subsequent to 1996, and perimeter streets defined pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, may retain existing numbered street names or be assigned new numbered street names at the discretion of city council.

Each day during which any owner or occupant fails to place the proper number on any building required to be numbered, or fails to correct any erroneous number on any such building, after being notified by any city official to do so, shall constitute a separate and distinct violation. (Ord. 987 § 33, 1991; Ord. 834 § 32, 1986; Ord. 477 § 4, 1964).

An action to foreclose a utility lien pursuant to a lien notice filed as required by this chapter must be commenced within two years from the date of filing thereof. An action to foreclose a six months’ lien may be commenced at any time after six months subsequent to the furnishing of the utility service for which payment has not been made. The service of summons and all other proceedings except as provided specifically under this chapter, including appeal, order of sale, sale, redemption and issuance of deed shall be governed by the statutes of the state of Washington now or hereafter in force relating to the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. The terms “judgment debtor” or “successor in interest” in the statutes of the state of Washington governing redemption when applied under this chapter shall include an owner or a vendee. All sales shall be subject to the right of redemption within one year from date of sale. At any time after deed is issued to it pursuant to a foreclosure of a lien, the city may lease or sell or convey the property conveyed thereunder at public or private sale for such price and on such terms as may be determined by the resolution of the city council.

(d) The recipient of utility services that have been obtained without full payment either through tampering, alteration, bypass, or falsification of records shall also be responsible and billed for the costs incurred by the city as a result of investigation, damages, repair, and bookkeeping.

(e) Notice of a supplemental bill shall be sent to the recipient of unauthorized or unmetered utility services. The supplemental bill shall be added to the next regular utility bill and shall be collected under the normal collection procedures. The notice of a supplemental billing shall consist of the following:

(2) Related costs pursuant to subsection (d) of this section;

For the purposes of FMC 17.08.040, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the recipient of unauthorized, unmetered or incorrectly metered utility services intended to deprive the utility of proper payment for its service. This presumption does not apply if the diversion of the utility’s service or the tampering, alteration, or replacement of the utility’s metering equipment is reasonably attributed to accident or accidental malfunction of the utility’s metering equipment.

Should the developer fail to comply with any of the provisions of this section, the project may be shut down unless and until the city has determined that said installation complies with city standards. The actual cost to the city of additional labor and all other costs incurred by the city to enforce compliance shall be paid by the developer prior to approval of the project. (Ord. 1279 § 7, 2001; Ord. 279 § 18, 1955).


21.04.190 Repairs and trouble calls.

Chapter 22.08 CONSISTENCY WITH DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS AND SEPA

Sections:

22.08.001    Determination of consistency.

22.08.002    Initial SEPA analysis.

22.08.003    Categorically exempt and planned actions.

22.08.004    Administrative interpretations.


22.08.001 Determination of consistency.

(a) Purpose. When the city receives a project permit application, consistency between the proposed project and the applicable regulations and comprehensive plan should be determined through the process in this chapter and the city’s adopted SEPA procedures and policies.

(b) Consistency. The city shall determine whether items (1) through (4) listed in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project. In the absence of applicable development regulations, the city shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the city’s adopted comprehensive plan. This determination of consistency shall consider the following:

(1) The type of land use permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances, if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied; and

(2) The level of development, such as units per acre, density of residential development in urban growth areas, or other measures of density; and

(3) Availability and adequacy of infrastructure and public facilities identified in the comprehensive plan, if the plan or development regulations provide for finding of these facilities as required by Chapter 36.70A RCW; and

(4) Character of the development, relative to adopted policies, regulations and guidelines (RCW 36.70B.030, 36.70B.040). (Ord. 1120 § 1, 1996).


22.08.002 Initial SEPA analysis.

(a) The city shall also review the project permit application under the requirements of the State Environmental Policy Act (“SEPA”), Chapter 43.21C RCW, the SEPA Rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC, and the city’s SEPA procedures and policies, and shall:

(1) Determine whether the applicable regulations require studies that adequately analyze all of the project permit application’s specific probable adverse environmental impacts;

(2) Determine if the applicable regulations require measures that adequately address such environmental impacts;

(3) Determine whether additional studies are required and/or whether the project permit application should be conditioned with additional mitigation measures;

(4) Provide the opportunity for coordinated review by government agencies and the public on compliance with applicable environmental laws and plans, including mitigation for specific project impacts that have not been considered and addressed at the plan or development regulation level.

(b) In the city’s review of a project permit application, the city may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection and mitigation measures in the applicable development regulations, comprehensive plan and/or in other applicable local, state or federal laws provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the application.

(c) If the city’s approval of the project permit application is based or conditioned on compliance with the requirements or mitigation measures described in subsection (a) of this section, the city shall not impose additional mitigation under SEPA during project review.

(d) A comprehensive plan, development regulation or other applicable local, state or federal law provides adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of an application when:

(1) The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; or

(2) The city has designated as acceptable certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards or other land use planning required or allowed by Chapter 36.70A RCW.

(e) In the city’s decision whether a specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or law of another agency with jurisdiction and environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the city shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. In making this deferral, the city shall base or condition project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws.

(f) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city’s review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analyses and requirements under other laws, as provided by Chapter 43.21C RCW. (Ord. 1120 § 1, 1996).


22.08.003 Categorically exempt and planned actions.

(a) Categorically Exempt. Actions categorically exempt under RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a) do not require environmental review or the preparation of an environmental impact statement. An action that is categorically exempt under the rules adopted by the Department of Ecology (Chapter 197-11 WAC) may not be conditioned or denied under SEPA (RCW 43.21C.031).

(b) Planned Actions.

(1) A planned action does not require a threshold determination or the preparation of an environmental impact statement under SEPA, but is subject to environmental review and mitigation under SEPA.

(2) A “planned action” means one or more types of project action that:

(A) Are designated planned actions by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the city;

(B) Have had the significant impacts adequately addressed in an environmental impact statement prepared in conjunction with:

(i) A comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, or

(ii) A fully contained community, a master planned resort, a master planned development or a phased project;

(C) Are subsequent or implementing projects for the proposals listed in subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section;

(D) Are located within an urban growth area, as defined in RCW 36.70A.030;

(E) Are not essential public facilities, as defined in RCW 36.70A.200; and

(F) Are consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW (RCW 43.21C.031).

(c) Limitations on Planned Actions. The city shall limit planned actions to certain types of development or to specific geographical areas that are less extensive than the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, and may limit a planned action to a time period identified in the environmental impact statement or in the ordinance or resolution designating the planned action under RCW 36.70A.040 (RCW 43.21C.031).

(d) Limitations on SEPA Review. During project review, the city shall not re-examine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in FMC 22.08.001(b), except for issues of code interpretation. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage swales, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a proposal’s probable adverse environmental impacts (RCW 36.70B.030(3)). (Ord. 1120 § 1, 1996).


22.08.004 Administrative interpretations.

(a) Purpose. The primary objective of administrative interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the code provision at issue and to give effect to that intent. Administrative interpretation shall not be used to amend or change the code. The city’s development regulations (the land development code) shall be interpreted whenever any of its provisions, or the application of such provisions to any specific set of circumstances, are ambiguous, i.e., where the code is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations.

(b) Administration. The director is authorized and directed to administer the provisions of this section and shall have the authority to approve or deny administrative interpretations without a hearing in accordance with this section.

(c) Procedure. The following steps shall be followed in the processing of an administrative interpretation:

(1) FMC 22.06.004, Determination of completeness;

(2) FMC 22.08.001, Determination of consistency;

(3) FMC 22.07.005, Notice of decision for administrative use permit, minor site plan review, minor variance, and administrative interpretation; and

(4) FMC 22.10.004, Closed record decisions and appeals (if any).

(d) Requirements for a Complete Application. The following materials shall be submitted to the city in order to constitute a complete application for an administrative interpretation:

(1) The name, address, telephone number and email address of the applicant, the completed application form with the date of submission to the city and the applicable fee;

(2) An identification of the code provision that is the subject of the applicant’s administrative interpretation, and a description of the applicant’s perception of the ambiguity in the code;

(3) A description of the set of circumstances, the address of the property or identification of the development that the applicant believes has created the ambiguity or two or more reasonable interpretations of the code provision identified in subsection (d)(2) of this section; and

(4) If the applicant is requesting an administrative interpretation relating to the applicability of a code provision to a particular piece of property, the applicant shall submit a verified statement that this property is in the exclusive ownership of the applicant, or that the applicant has submitted the request for the interpretation with the consent of all owners of the affected property.

(e) Criteria for Approval. Administrative interpretation shall utilize generally recognized principles of statutory and ordinance interpretation adopted by the courts of this state. In addition:

(1) The provisions of the land development code shall be considered to include the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion and protection of the public health, safety and general welfare, and all administrative interpretations shall be made in this context.

(2) The provisions of the land development code are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties, except where the agreements may conflict with the enforcement of the land development code.

(3) In the case of conflicts between the portions of the land development code and other rules, regulations, resolutions, ordinances or statutes lawfully adopted by other authority having jurisdiction within the city, the most restrictive shall govern. In the case of conflicts between the text, maps and charts of the land development code, the text shall govern unless otherwise stated.

(4) Zoning Map Interpretation. Where uncertainty exists as to the location of any boundaries of the zones shown on the city’s official zoning map, the rules of interpretation listed in FMC 22.30.004 shall apply.

(f) No Limitation for Final Decision. An administrative interpretation is not a project permit application, and is not subject to a deadline for issuance of a final decision. (Ord. 1611 § 3, 2018).

(c) Except for Type V actions, a member absent during the presentation of evidence in a hearing may not participate in the deliberations or decision unless the member has reviewed the evidence received. (Ord. 1120 § 1, 1996).


22.09.006 Burden and nature of proof.

Except for Type V actions, the burden of proof is on the proponent. The project permit application must be supported by proof that it conforms to the applicable elements of the city’s development regulations and comprehensive plan, and that any significant adverse environmental impacts have been adequately addressed. (Ord. 1120 § 1, 1996).


22.09.007 Order of proceedings.

The order of proceedings for a hearing will depend in part on the nature of the hearing. The following shall be supplemented by administrative procedures as appropriate.

(f) After receiving information, the hearing body shall openly discuss the issue and may further question a person submitting information or the staff if opportunity for rebuttal is provided.

(g) When the planning commission performs in the capacity as the hearing body, a majority of the commission’s membership shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of official business; provided, that a smaller number may adjourn from time to time. Every official act taken by the commission on discretionary items requiring a public hearing shall be by resolution or motion adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the membership, except in those instances when one or more members of the commission recuse themselves from a particular case, then a resolution or motion shall be adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the membership present. However, failure to obtain such affirmative vote shall not prevent consideration by the commission of other resolutions and motions concerning such item which may subsequently be properly presented. All other official actions taken by the commission shall be by resolution or motion adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum, or of the members present, if more members are present than required for a quorum.

Pursuant to the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA), Chapter 36.70A RCW, after the adoption of its comprehensive plan, the city of Fircrest is required to ensure that applicable public improvements or strategies to accommodate the impacts of development are made concurrent with the development. The intent of this chapter is to establish a concurrency management system to ensure that all public facilities and services needed to maintain minimum level of service standards are available simultaneous to or within a reasonable time after development occupancy or use. This chapter implements the goals, policies and implementation strategies of the capital facilities element of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1275 § 1, 2001).


22.12.002 Concurrency test.

(a) Application. The city review of all applications for preliminary development permits, unless exempted by FMC 22.12.004, shall include a concurrency test. Any final development permits that did not have preceding preliminary development permit approval shall also be subject to this concurrency test, unless exempted by FMC 22.12.004.

(b) Procedures. The concurrency test will be performed in the processing of the development permit and conducted by the planning/building department in conjunction with the public works department and other facility and service providers.

(1) The planning/building department shall provide the overall coordination of the concurrency test by notifying the facility and service providers of all applications requiring a concurrency test as set forth in subsection (a) of this section; notifying applicants of the test results; notifying the facility and service providers of the final outcome (approval or denial) of the development permit; and notifying the facility and service providers of any expired development permits or discontinued certificates of capacity.

(2) The facility and service providers shall be responsible for maintaining and monitoring their available and planned capacity by conducting the concurrency test for their individual facility or service for all applications requiring a concurrency test as set forth in subsection (a) of this section; reserving the capacity needed for each application; accounting for the capacity for each exempted application which uses capacity; notifying the planning/building department of the results of the test; and reinstating any capacity for an expired development permit, discontinued certificate of capacity, or other action resulting in an applicant no longer needing capacity which has been reserved.

(c) Test. Development permits that result in a reduction of a level of service below the minimum level of service standard cannot be approved. For arterial roads, transit, fire/EMS, law enforcement, schools and parks, available and planned capacity will be used in conducting the concurrency test. For water, power, sanitary sewer, fire flow and stormwater management, only available capacity will be used in conducting the concurrency test.

(1) If the capacity of public facilities is equal to or greater than the capacity required to maintain the level of service standard for the impact from the development permit, the concurrency test is passed. A certificate of capacity will be issued according to the provisions of FMC 22.12.003.

(2) If the capacity of public facilities is less than the capacity required to maintain the level of service standard for the impact from the development permit, the concurrency test is not passed. The applicant may:

(A) Modify the application to reduce the need for public facilities that do not exist;

(B) Demonstrate to the director’s satisfaction that the development will have a lower need for capacity than usual and, therefore, capacity is adequate;

(C) Arrange with the appropriate facility and service provider capacity for the provision of the additional concurrency facilities required; or

(D) Appeal the results of the concurrency test to the hearing examiner in accordance with the provisions of FMC 22.12.006.

(d) SEPA. Nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the application of the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) to specific proposals. Each proposal not exempt under SEPA shall be reviewed and may be conditioned or denied under the authority of the State Environmental Policy Act. (Ord. 1638 § 7, 2019; Ord. 1275 § 1, 2001).


22.12.003 Certificate of capacity.

(a) Issuance. A certificate of capacity, guaranteeing the availability of public facility capacity subject to the terms contained herein, shall be issued upon approval of the development permit. If applicable, the payment of a fee and/or the performance of any condition required by the city or other facility and service provider shall be a condition of certificate of capacity issuance. Administrative procedures may specify issuance of certificate of capacity at an earlier timeframe and conditions required thereof.

(b) A certificate of capacity shall apply only to the specific land uses, densities, intensities and development described in the application and development permit.

(c) A certificate of capacity is not transferable to other land, but may be transferred to new owners of the original land.

(d) Life Span of Certificate. A certificate of capacity shall expire if the accompanying development permit expires or is revoked. A certificate of capacity may be extended according to the same terms and conditions as the accompanying development permit. If the development permit is granted an extension, so shall the certificate of capacity. If the accompanying development permit does not expire, the certificate of capacity shall be valid for five years.

(e) Unused Capacity. Any capacity that is not used because the developer decides not to develop or because the accompanying development permit expires shall be returned to the available pool of capacity. (Ord. 1275 § 1, 2001).


22.12.004 Exemptions.

(a) No Impact. Development permits for development that creates no measurable additional impacts on any public facility are exempt from the requirements of this chapter. Such development includes, but is not limited to:

(1) Any accessory structure or addition to a residence with no change in use or increase in the number of dwelling units;

(2) Interior renovations with no change of use or, if a residential use, no increase in number of dwelling units;

(3) Interior completion of a structure for use(s) with the same or less intensity as the existing use or a previously approved use;

(4) Replacement structure with no change in use or floor area (for nonresidential uses) or increase in number of dwelling units;

(5) Temporary construction trailers;

(6) Driveway resurfacing or parking lot paving;

(7) Re-roofing of structures;

(8) Demolitions; and

(9) Other types of development determined by the director to meet this “no impact” standard.

(b) Exempt Permits. The following development permits are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

(1) Boundary line adjustment or lot combination; 

(2) Final plat, if a concurrency test was conducted for the corresponding preliminary plat approval;

(3) Temporary use permit;

(4) Variance or administrative use permit;

(5) Clearing, filling and grading permit;

(6) Administrative design review; 

(7) Rezone/comprehensive plan amendment;

(8) Sign permit;

(9) Complete development permit applications submitted before the effective date of this chapter; and

(10) Building permits for single-family, duplex and accessory dwelling units. This exemption does not apply to the plat within which the dwelling units are being constructed.

(c) Accounting for Capacity. The capacity for development permits exempted under subsections (b)(9) and (10) of this section shall be subtracted from available capacity. (Ord. 1275 § 1, 2001).


22.12.005 Pre-existing use rights.

Development permits that were issued before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be considered to have capacity as long as the accompanying development permit is valid. If the accompanying development permit does not expire, capacity shall be considered to be available for five years after the effective date of this chapter. (Ord. 1275 § 1, 2001).


22.12.006 Appeals.

Determinations by the director with respect to the applicability of concurrency management to a given development activity or any other determination which the director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter may be appealed to the hearing examiner as provided for in Chapter 22.05 FMC. Upon receiving an appeal, the director shall notify the appropriate facility or service provider(s) of the appeal. After conducting a public hearing, the hearing examiner shall issue a determination either upholding the original determination or amending it. (Ord. 1638 § 8, 2019; Ord. 1275 § 1, 2001).

(b) The director shall review newly created lots to ensure the lots:

(1) Will continue to function and operate as one site, for fully developed sites; or

(2) Conform to an approved development plan including any adopted rules and regulations or required conditions as represented in an approved development plan or associated approval document, if the binding site plan is being considered with a development plan.

(c) If applicable, the director shall review the environmental checklist and other available information and issue an appropriate threshold decision. The threshold decision may require measures to mitigate any significant adverse environmental impact.

(d) The director shall contact the appropriate sewer purveyor to review the binding site plan for potential sewer adequacy.

(e) The director shall review proposed lot sites that are known or suspected to be poor building sites because of geological hazard, flooding, wetland, or other environmental or critical area constraint or limitation, and such may be noted on the face of the site plan.

(f) The city engineer shall review the site plan for compliance with public works codes, including but not limited to the adequacy of the proposed street and storm drainage systems.

(g) The fire code official shall review the proposed site plan for fire protection issues, including but not limited to fire hydrant location and emergency vehicle access.

(h) In addition to other standards required by this title, the director may require additional standards and conditions or may modify the standards and conditions in such a manner as is necessary to:

(1) Maintain the intent and purpose of this title;

(2) Assure that a degree of compatibility shall be maintained with respect to properties and existing or potential uses within the general area; and

(3) Preserve the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.

(i) The recommendations of the director, city engineer, and the fire code official shall become part of the record. (Ord. 1611 § 4, 2018).


22.23.006 Decisions.

(a) The director may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a binding site plan.

(h) Subject to compliance with all other applicable standards of this chapter, a building permit application need not be filed for emergency repair or maintenance of a personal wireless service facility until 30 days after the completion of such emergency activity.

(i) A COW or other temporary personal wireless telecommunications facility shall be permitted for a maximum of 90 days or during an emergency. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.003 Policy statement.

(a) The city, with increasing frequency, has been approached with requests to locate towers and antennas. The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: (i) enhance the ability of personal wireless service providers to provide such services throughout the city quickly, effectively, and efficiently; (ii) encourage personal wireless service providers to locate towers and antenna in nonresidential areas; (iii) encourage personal wireless service providers to co-locate on new and existing tower sites; (iv) encourage personal wireless service providers to locate towers and antennas, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on city residents is minimal; and (v) encourage personal wireless service providers to configure towers and antennas in a way that minimizes any significant adverse visual impact. Accordingly, the city finds that the promulgation of this chapter is warranted and necessary:

(1) To manage the location of towers and antennas in the city;

(2) To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers;

(3) To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;

(4) To accommodate an increased need for towers to serve the wireless communications needs of city residents;

(5) To promote and encourage co-location on existing and new towers as an option rather than construction of additional single-use towers, and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future;

(6) To consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent permitted by the Telecommunications Act of 1996; and

(7) To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties through sound engineering practices and the proper siting of antenna support structures.

(b) All new antennas shall comply with this chapter after the date of passage of the ordinance codified herein. All towers and antennas existing on the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be allowed to continue as they presently exist, but will be considered nonconforming uses if they do not fully comply with the requirements of this chapter. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on existing towers and antennas. However, new construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers, antennas, buildings or other facilities shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.004 Recognition of industry site selection criteria.

In establishing a new site, the industry requires a location that is technically compatible with the established network. A general area is to be identified based upon engineering constraints and the desired area of service. Specific locations within that general area will be evaluated using the following criteria which are not listed in order of priority:

(a) Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum efficiency in telephone service.

(b) Availability of road access.

(c) Availability of electric power.

(d) Availability of land-based telephone lines or microwave link capability.

(e) Leasable lands, and landlords who want facilities to be located on their properties consistent with zoning regulations.

(f) Screening potential of existing vegetation, structures and topographic features.

(g) Zoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities.

(h) Compatibility with adjacent land uses.

(i) The least number of sites to cover the desired area.

(j) The greatest amount of coverage, consistent with physical requirements.

(k) Opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact.

(l) Availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.005 Site selection criteria.

(a) Any applicant proposing to construct an antenna support structure, or mount an antenna on an existing structure, shall demonstrate by engineering evidence that the antenna must be located at the site to satisfy its function in the applicant’s local grid system. Further, the applicant must demonstrate by engineering evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the site’s function within the grid system.

(b) Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates either that it is an FCC-licensed telecommunications provider or that it has agreements with an FCC-licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure.

(c) Low power mobile radio service facilities shall be located and designed to minimize any significant adverse impact on residential properties. Facilities shall be placed in locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings, or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening.

(d) In all zones, location and design of facilities shall consider the impact of the facility on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district. In all zones, towers shall be significantly screened by placing them in trees to the extent that it does not result in significant signal degradation. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.006 Facility preference.

(a) Proposed antennas, associated structures and placement shall be evaluated, based on available technologies, for approval and use in the following order of preference:

(1) Camouflaged antennas;

(2) Building-mounted facilities or structure-mounted facilities, only when subsection (a)(1) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished;

(3) Co-location facilities, only when subsections (a)(1) or (2) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished;

(4) Ground-mounted facilities which extend no more than 15 feet above existing vegetation or structures, only when subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished;

(5) Ground-mounted facilities which extend more than 15 feet above existing vegetation or structures, only when subsections (a)(1) through (4) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished.

(b) If the applicant chooses to construct new ground-mounted facilities, the burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show a facility of a higher order of preference cannot reasonably be accommodated on the same or other properties. As stated in FMC 22.24.016, the city reserves the right to retain a third party consultant, at the applicant’s expense, to review the supporting documentation for accuracy. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).

(14) Documentation as to how the proposed site will fit into the applicant’s existing overall network within the city. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.010 Co-location. 

(a) To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers, co-location of personal wireless service facilities on existing or new towers is encouraged as follows:

(1) Proposed facilities may, and are encouraged to, co-locate onto existing towers. Co-location is permitted subject to administrative use permit approval, and new or amended conditional use permit approval is not required; provided, that all other permit, license, lease, or franchise requirements are satisfied, the modified facilities do not require a variance, and the co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with the policies, design criteria, and other requirements contained in this chapter.

(2) The city may deny an application to construct new facilities if the applicant has not shown by substantial evidence that it has made a diligent effort to mount the facilities on an existing building, existing structure or existing tower.

(3) To reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the city in the future, new proposed support structures shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical or physical reasons.

(4) Unless co-location is not feasible, an applicant’s site plan shall reserve an area for other providers’ equipment near the base of the applicant’s tower. A first right-of-refusal, which is either executed or maintained while the provider’s personal wireless facilities and services are in use, to lease the area at the base of the tower or mount for other providers will meet the reservation requirement. The site plan for towers in excess of 100 feet above ground level must propose space for two comparable providers, while the site plan for towers 100 feet or less must propose space for one comparable provider.

(5) To provide further incentive for co-location, an existing conforming tower may be modified subject to administrative use permit approval to accommodate co-location without a new or amended conditional use permit, provided the following conditions are met:

(A) An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed 20 feet over the tower’s existing height and subject to the other provisions of this chapter. The height change may occur only once per tower;

(B) The additional antenna is of the same general type and size as that on the existing tower;

(C) The modifications do not increase the height of the tower and/or antenna beyond the height threshold which requires a variance.

(6) While co-location and the requirements herein are encouraged, co-location shall not take precedence over the construction of shorter towers with appropriate screening. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.011 Design criteria.

(a) As provided in FMC 22.24.010, new facilities shall be designed to accommodate co-location, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical, or physical reasons.

(b) Facilities shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses and screened or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site.

(1) Setback. Antennas and associated support structures shall comply with the minimum setback requirements specified in the underlying zone district and shall not be located within the area between the front setback line and the front of the main building(s) on a lot; provided, however, that the city may reduce such requirements if:

(A) There are unusual geographical limitations which preclude the placement of the facilities in full compliance with the specified setback requirement;

(B) The placement of the facilities within the required setback will allow for more effective screening and camouflaging of the facilities; and

(C) There will be no significant adverse impact on adjoining properties resulting from the reduced setback.

The city may, on a case-by-case basis, increase the required setbacks for antennas and associated support facilities, if necessary, to ensure that potential impacts on adjoining properties are effectively mitigated.

(2) Right-of-Way Setback Exception. The setback requirement may be waived if the antenna and antenna support structure are located in the city right-of-way.

(3) View Corridors. Due consideration shall be given so that placement of towers, antennas, and personal wireless service facilities does not obstruct or significantly diminish views of Mt. Rainier or the Olympic Mountains.

(4) Color. Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility, unless a different color is required by the FCC or FAA.

(5) Lights, Signals and Signs. No signals, lights, or signs shall be permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or FAA. Should lighting be required, in cases where there are residents located within a distance which is 300 percent of the height of the tower, then dual mode lighting shall be requested from the FAA.

(6) Equipment Structures. Ground level equipment, buildings, and the tower base shall be screened from public view. The standards for the equipment buildings are as follows:

(A) The maximum floor area is 300 square feet and the maximum height is 12 feet. Except in unusual circumstances or for other public policy considerations the equipment building may be located no more than 250 feet from the tower or antenna. Depending upon the aesthetics and other issues, the city, in its sole discretion, may approve multiple equipment structures or one or more larger structures.

(B) Ground-level buildings shall be screened from view by landscape plantings, fencing, or other appropriate means, as specified herein or in the city’s design guidelines or other applicable standards, unless it can be demonstrated that such screening will create a greater negative visual impact than an unscreened building.

(C) Equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar to the exterior building walls. Equipment for roof-mounted antenna may also be located within the building on which the antenna is mounted.

(D) Equipment buildings shall comply with setback requirements specified in the underlying zone district and shall be designed so as to conform in appearance with nearby residential structures if located within a residential land use designation area.

(E) Equipment buildings, antennas, and related equipment shall occupy no more than 25 percent of the total roof area of the building the facility is mounted on, which may vary in the city’s sole discretion if co-location and an adequate screening structure are used.

(7) Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If those standards and regulations are changed, then personal wireless service providers governed by this chapter shall bring their towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within three months of their effective date or the timelines provided by the revised standards and regulations, whichever time period is longer. The revised standards and regulations are not retroactively applicable to existing providers, unless otherwise provided or permitted by federal law. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the city to remove a provider’s facilities at the provider’s expense.

(8) Building Codes, Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the provider/owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable city building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the EIA, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the provider/owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the provider/owner fails to bring its tower into compliance within 30 days, the city may remove the tower at the provider’s/owner’s expense.

(9) Structural Design. Towers shall be constructed to the EIA standards, which may be amended from time to time, and to all applicable construction/building codes. Further, any improvements or additions to existing towers shall require submission of plans stamped by a licensed structural engineer which demonstrate compliance with the EIA standards and all other good industry practices. The plans shall be submitted and reviewed at the time building permits are requested.

(10) Fencing. A well-constructed wall or wooden fence not less than six feet in height from the finished grade shall be provided around each personal wireless service facility. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. The use of chain link, plastic, vinyl, or wire fencing is prohibited unless it is fully screened from public view by a minimum eight-foot-wide landscaping strip. All landscaping shall comply with the city’s design guidelines and other applicable standards.

(11) Landscaping/Screening.

(A) Landscaping, as described herein, shall be required to screen personal wireless service facilities, as much as possible, to soften the appearance of the cell site. The city may permit any combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted flush on an existing building, and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure, landscaping shall not be required.

(B) The visual impacts of a personal wireless service facility shall be mitigated through landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary structures. The following landscaping and buffering shall be required around the perimeter of the tower and accessory structures, except that the city may waive the standards for those sides of the facility that are not in public view. Landscaping and any irrigation deemed necessary by the city shall be installed on the outside of fences. Further, existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for, or as a supplement to, landscaping requirements.

(i) A row of evergreen trees a minimum of six feet tall at planting and a maximum of six feet apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the fence;

(ii) A continuous hedge at least 36 inches high at planting capable of growing to at least 48 inches in height within 18 months shall be planted in front of the tree line referenced above;

(iii) In the event that landscaping is not maintained at the required level, the city after giving 30 days’ advance written notice may maintain or establish the landscaping and bill both the owner and lessee for such costs until such costs are paid in full.

(12) Tower and Antenna Height.

(A) The applicant shall demonstrate that the tower and antenna are the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. No tower or antenna that is taller than this minimum height shall be approved. No tower or mount shall exceed 60 feet in low density residential, medium density residential, high density residential and neighborhood commercial land use designation areas or 110 feet in the community commercial or industrial land use designation areas. Towers or mounts shall not exceed 60 feet in areas designated parks, recreation, and open space, and public and quasi-public facilities, if located within 250 feet of a land use designation area with a 60-foot height limit. Otherwise, towers or mounts located in these two land use designation areas shall not exceed 110 feet.

(B) A variance from the height limit may be granted if the applicant can show by clear and convincing evidence that the additional height is necessary to provide adequate service to the residents of the city and no other alternative is available. When granting a variance, the hearing examiner shall require that a significant portion of the tower and related facilities be screened by existing trees or existing structures. Generally, this means that all but the top 15 feet of the tower and related facilities shall be screened by existing trees or existing structures. Variance criteria are listed in FMC 22.24.013.

(13) Antenna Support Structure Safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed antenna and support structure are safe and the surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by support structure failure, falling ice, or other debris or interference. All support structures shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers.

(14) Required Parking. If the cell site is fully automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the site is not automated, arrangements for adequate off-street parking shall be made and documentation thereof provided to the city, unless it can be demonstrated that the use of on-street parking spaces will create less impact on the immediate neighborhood. Security fencing should be colored or of a design which blends into the character of the existing environment consistent with the provisions listed in subsection (b)(10) of this section.

(15) Antenna Criteria. Antenna on or above a structure shall be subject to the following:

(A) The antenna shall be architecturally compatible with the building and wall on which it is mounted, and shall be designed and located so as to minimize any adverse aesthetic impact.

(B) The antenna shall be mounted on a wall of an existing building in a configuration as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not project above the wall on which it is mounted unless it must for technical reasons. In no event shall an antenna project more than 16 feet above the roof line including parapets. An antenna may project into a required building setback a distance not to exceed that allowed for architectural projections in the underlying zoning district; provided, that such encroachment is required for technical reasons.

(C) The antenna shall be constructed, painted, or fully screened to match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on which it is mounted.

(D) The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building, but may not project more than 16 feet above the roofline of the building including parapets but excluding the enclosure.

(E) If an accessory equipment shelter is present, it must blend with the surrounding buildings in architectural character and color.

(F) The structure must be architecturally and visually (color, size, bulk) compatible with surrounding existing buildings, structures, vegetation, and uses. Such facilities will be considered architecturally and visually compatible if they are camouflaged to disguise the facility.

(G) Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation should be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual mitigation techniques must be evaluated in advance by the city relative to its design guidelines and other applicable standards.

(H) For installations on buildings 30 feet or less in height, the antenna may be mounted on the roof if the following additional criteria are satisfied:

(i) The city finds that it is not technically possible or aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall.

(ii) No portion of the antenna or base station causes the height of the building to exceed the limitations set forth herein.

(iii) The antenna or antennas and related base stations cover no more than an aggregate total of 25 percent of the roof area of a building, which may vary in the city’s sole discretion, if co-locating and an adequate screening structure are used.

(iv) Roof-mounted antenna and related base stations are completely screened from view by materials that are consistent and compatible with the design, color, and materials of the building.

(v) No portion of the antenna exceeds 16 feet above the roofline of the existing building including parapets but excluding mechanical equipment enclosures and other projecting features.

(I) Antennas attached to the roof or sides of a building at least 30 feet in height, an existing tower, a water tank, or a similar structure must be either:

(i) An omnidirectional or whip antenna no more than seven inches in diameter and extending no more than 16 feet above the structure to which it is attached; or

(ii) A panel antenna no more than two feet wide and six feet long, extending above the structure to which it is attached by no more than 10 feet.

(J) Except as set forth herein, no signs, banners or similar devices or materials may be attached to the tower, antenna support structures or antennas.

(K) Antennas, antenna arrays, and support structures not on publicly owned property shall not extend more than 16 feet above the highest point of the structure on which they are mounted. The antenna, antenna array, and their support structure shall be mounted so as to blend with the structure to which the antenna is attached. The antenna and its support structure shall be designed to withstand a wind force of 100 miles per hour without the use of supporting guy wires. The antenna, antenna array, and their support structure shall be a color that blends with the structure on which they are mounted.

(L) Guy Wires Restricted. No guy or other support wires shall be used in connection with such antenna, antenna array, or its support structure except when used to anchor the antenna, antenna array, or support structure to an existing building to which such antenna, antenna array, or support structure is attached.

(M) To the extent that antennas are attached to electric, phone or light poles and such antennas are no more than two feet in height, administrative use and building permit review will be required, but such antennas shall not be subject to setback and screening requirements.

(N) If a proposed antenna is located on a building or a lot subject to a site review, approval is required prior to the issuance of a building permit.

(O) No antenna shall be permitted on property designated as an individual landmark or as a part of a historic district, unless such antenna is camouflaged in accordance with applicable design guidelines.

(P) All personal wireless service providers or lessees or agents thereof shall cooperate in good faith to accommodate co-location with competitors. If a dispute arises about the feasibility of co-locating, the planning/building director may require a third-party technical study, at the expense of either or both parties, to resolve the dispute.

(Q) All personal wireless service providers or lessees shall assure that their antenna complies at all times with the current applicable FCC standards. After installation, but prior to putting the antenna in service, each provider shall submit a certification by an independent professional radio frequency (RF) engineer to that effect. In the event that an antenna is co-located with another antenna, the certification must provide assurances that FCC-approved levels of electromagnetic radiation will not be exceeded by the co-location.

(R) No antenna shall cause localized interference with the reception of any other communications signals including, but not limited to, public safety, television, and radio broadcast signals.

(S) No person shall locate an antenna or tower for wireless communications services upon any lot or parcel except as provided in this chapter.

(16) Noise. No equipment shall be operated so as to produce noise in violation of the maximum noise levels set forth in Chapter 173-60 WAC. (Ord. 1638 § 18, 2019; Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.012 Permits required.

(a) Where a tower or antenna support structure will be 110 feet or less in height and located within an industrial, community commercial, park, recreation and open space, or public and quasi-public facilities land use designation area, in addition to the other provisions of this chapter, an applicant will be required to obtain a Type II administrative use permit. In the event that a proposed tower or antenna support structure will be located in a neighborhood commercial, high density residential, medium density residential, or low density residential land use designation area, in addition to the other provisions of this chapter, an applicant will be required to obtain a Type III conditional use permit. For all towers or structure-mounted or building-mounted wireless facilities which will require a variance, an applicant will be required to obtain a Type III conditional use permit.

 (b) Project permit review procedures are specified in this title. The following table specifies the permits required for the various types of personal wireless service facilities that meet the standards of this chapter.

Type of Permit 

	Type of Facility	Conditional Use	Administrative Use

(only if variance required)	X

	Towers ≤ 60 feet and structure-mounted or building-mounted wireless facilities in: neighborhood commercial; high density residential; medium density residential; and low density residential land use designation areas	X	 

	Modification of existing facilities to accommodate co-location	X

(only if variance required)	X

	All other towers and structure-mounted or building-mounted wireless facilities which require a variance	X	 

(Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.013 Variances.

Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall be processed in accordance with this title and may be granted by the hearing examiner upon making the following findings:

(a) The granting of the variance will facilitate the installation of facilities which represent a positive design improvement over what would otherwise be permitted by this chapter.

(b) The granting of the variance is necessary for adequate service to be provided to residents of the city, and no alternative locations or designs are available to provide an adequate level of service to the city.

(c) Such variance is necessary because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property.

(d) The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity in which the subject facilities would be located. (Ord. 1638 § 19, 2019; Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.014 Inspection requirements. 

Each year after a facility becomes operational, the facility operator shall conduct a safety inspection in accordance with the EIA and FCC standards and within 30 days of the inspection file a report with the planning/building director. Submission of a copy of FCC-required, and duly filed, safety inspection report, or the facility operator’s maintenance reports for the prior 12 months in the event no FCC report is required for such year, shall satisfy the requirements of this section. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.015 Non-use/abandonment.

(a) Abandonment. No less than 30 days prior to the date that a personal wireless service provider plans to abandon or discontinue operation of a facility, the provider must notify the city of Fircrest by certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operation. In the event that a licensed carrier fails to give notice, the facility shall be considered abandoned upon the city’s discovery of discontinuation of operation. Upon such abandonment, the provider shall have 90 days or additional period of time determined in the reasonable discretion of the city within which to:

(1) Reactivate the use of the facility or transfer the facility to another provider who makes actual use of the facility.

(2) In the event that abandonment as defined in this chapter occurs due to relocation of an antenna at a lower point on the antenna support structure, reduction in the effective radiated power of the antenna or reduction in the number of transmissions from the antennas, the operator of the tower shall have six months from the date of effective abandonment to co-locate another service on the tower. If another service provider is not added to the tower, then the operator shall promptly dismantle and remove that portion of the tower which exceeds the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes which are made to personal wireless facilities which do not diminish their essential role in providing a total system shall not constitute abandonment. However, in the event that there is a physical reduction in height of substantially all of the provider’s towers in the city or surrounding area then all of the towers within the city shall similarly be reduced in height, unless the provider demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that a high tower site remains necessary to ensure full coverage in the community without having to build additional sites.

(3) Dismantle and remove facility. If the tower, antenna, foundation, and facility are not removed within the 90-day time period or additional period of time allowed by the city, the city may remove such tower, antenna, foundation, and related facility at the provider’s expense; provided, however, that recovery of expenses shall be limited to reasonable and documented costs of removal. If there are two or more providers co-locating on a facility, except as provided for in subsection (a)(2) of this section, this provision shall not become effective until all providers cease using the facility.

At the earlier of 90 days from the date of abandonment without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and removal, city approval for the facility shall automatically expire, unless an extension is granted by the city. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).


22.24.016 Third party review.

(a) Personal wireless service providers use various methodologies and analyses, including geographically-based computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of their services and low power mobile radio service facilities, such as expected coverage area, antenna configuration, topographic constraints that affect signal paths, etc. In certain instances, a third party expert may need to review the technical data submitted by a provider. The city may require a technical review as part of a permitting process. The costs of the technical review shall be borne by the provider.

(b) The selection of the third party expert may be by mutual agreement between the provider and the city, or at the discretion of the city, with a provision for the provider and interested parties to comment on the proposed expert and review its qualifications. The expert review is intended to address interference and public safety issues and be a site-specific review of technical aspects of the facilities or a review of the provider’s methodology and equipment used and not a subjective review of the site which was selected by a provider. Based on the results of the expert review, the city may require changes to the provider’s application. The expert review shall address the following:

(1) The accuracy and completeness of submissions;

(2) The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;

(3) The validity of conclusions reached; and

(4) Any specific technical issues designated by the city. (Ord. 1153 § 2, 1997).

22.26.001 Intent and purpose.

(a) Intent. Signs have a strong visual impact on the character and quality of the community. As a prominent part of the scenery, they attract or repel the viewing public and affect the safety of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. Their suitability or appropriateness helps to set the tone for a neighborhood. The city relies upon its scenery and physical beauty to attract commerce; aesthetic considerations assume economic value. It is the intent of the city, through this chapter, to protect and enhance the city’s historic and residential character and its economic base through the provision of appropriate and aesthetic signage. In addition, it is the intent of the city to regulate the size, type and location of signs in order to minimize their distracting effect on drivers and thereby improve traffic and enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety.

(b) Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and welfare through a comprehensive system of reasonable, effective, consistent, content-neutral and nondiscriminatory sign standards and requirements. This chapter has also been adopted to:

(1) Promote and accomplish the goals, policies and objectives of the city’s comprehensive plan and land development code;

(2) Provide minimum standards in order to safeguard life, health, property and public welfare, and promote traffic safety by controlling the design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location and maintenance of sign and sign structures;

(3) Recognize free speech rights by regulating signs in a content-neutral manner;

(4) Promote the free flow of traffic and protect pedestrians, cyclists and motorists from injury and property damage caused by, or which may be fully or partially attributable to, cluttered, distracting and/or illegible signage;

(5) Protect the beauty of the city’s built environment by encouraging signs that are compatible with the architectural style, characteristics and scale of the building to which it may be attached, and to encourage signs that are compatible with adjacent buildings and businesses;

(6) Protect property values, the local economy, and the quality of life by preserving and enhancing the appearance of the streetscape;

(7) Provide consistent sign design standards;

(8) Encourage creative and innovative approaches to signage, and signs that are of a quality design, pleasing in appearance and appropriate in size, materials and illumination to the surrounding neighborhood;

(9) Provide an improved visual environment for the citizens of and visitors to the city; and

(10) Adopt clear, understandable regulations that enable the fair and consistent enforcement of this chapter. (Ord. 1598 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.002 Applicability and interpretation.

This chapter applies to all signs as defined in Chapter 22.98 FMC, within the city that are visible from any street, sidewalk or public place, regardless of the type or nature.

This chapter is not intended to, and shall not be interpreted to, restrict speech on the basis of its content, viewpoint, or message. Any classification of signs in this chapter that purports to permit speech by reason of the type of sign, identity of the sign user or otherwise, shall be interpreted to allow commercial or noncommercial speech on the sign. No part of this chapter shall be construed to favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech. To the extent that any provision of this chapter is ambiguous, the term shall be interpreted not to regulate speech on the basis of the content of the message. (Ord. 1598 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1473 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.003 Application procedures.

Sign permit review is classified as a Type II-A application. The processing procedures for this type of application are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. (Ord. 1598 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.004 Permit requirements and approval authority.

(a) No sign shall hereafter be erected, reerected, constructed, altered, or maintained, except as provided by this chapter. A sign permit shall be obtained prior to any sign being erected, reerected, constructed, or altered, unless said sign is exempt from the permit requirements of this chapter pursuant to FMC 22.26.025. In addition, a building permit shall be obtained prior to the installation or modification of any sign for which a building permit is required under the International Building Code. A separate permit shall be required for each nonexempt sign installed, except if a sign is part of a group of signs being installed at one time on a single supporting structure, only one permit shall be required.

(b) The director may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny an application for a sign permit. A sign permit shall be approved when the director has determined that a proposed sign will comply with all requirements of this chapter and, when applicable, the requirements of the International Building Code.

(c) Duration of a Sign Permit. In the event that a sign permit has not been exercised and the operations authorized under the sign permit have not been completed or substantially completed within 180 days after the date of the permit, the sign permit shall be automatically null and void.

(d) Interpretation. In all applications for sign permits where a matter of interpretation arises, the most restrictive definition shall prevail. (Ord. 1598 § 4, 2017; Ord. 1473 § 2, 2009; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.005 Submittal requirements.

Application for a sign permit shall be submitted on forms provided by the department with the following items:

(a) Two copies of a scaled site plan showing the location of the affected lot, building(s) and sign(s);

(b) Two copies of a scaled drawing of the proposed sign or sign revision showing dimensions, area, height, structural footing details, method of attachment, type of illumination, and other construction details;

(c) Two copies of supporting documentation including material specifications, calculation for dead load and wind pressure, photographs or photo simulations of site and building marked to show where sign is proposed, and any other information required by the director to ensure compliance with applicable code requirements;

(d) Written consent of the sign owner and the owner of the building, structure, or property where the sign is to be erected;

(e) A nonrefundable filing fee in accordance with the planning services fee schedule established by council resolution;

(f) Documentation demonstrating that the sign installer has a valid Washington State contractor’s license when a sign requires a building permit, unless the sign is being installed by the owner of the sign.

The director may waive submission of specific plans, specifications or supporting documentation when such information is not necessary to determine compliance with applicable code requirements. (Ord. 1598 § 5, 2017; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.006 Master sign plans. 

(a) Before a sign permit may be issued for any commercial multi-tenant building constructed after the effective date of this chapter, or for any existing multi-tenant building whose exterior will be altered to the degree that existing signage will be replaced, a master sign plan shall be submitted to, and approved by, the city. Master sign plans shall be approved through the site plan review, development plan review, or conditional use permit process, as appropriate. Existing multi-tenant buildings may have master sign plans approved by the director in order to simplify the permitting process for individual signs at a later date. Individual buildings located within a multi-building complex may have separate master sign plans.

(b) Master sign plans shall indicate the amount, location, and type of signage allocated to each tenant space. The number of sign types, such as awning signs, cabinet signs, individual graphics, pan-channel sign graphics, sandblasted or carved wood signs, flat wood signs with hand painted or vinyl graphics, and neon signs, shall be limited to ensure visual continuity from one tenant space to the next within a building. If more than one sign type is used on a single building, the sign types shall have at least two of the following design elements in common with each other:

(1) Common colors on the background or text;

(2) Common lettering style;

(3) Common size (e.g., a specified height common to each sign); or

(4) Common materials.

(c) Criteria for Approval. All signs in the master sign plan must comply with FMC 22.26.004 and meet the following criteria:

(1) Signs shall be architecturally similar and visually related to each other through the incorporation of common design elements. Up to two sign types may be used on any one building. All sign cabinets, trim caps and all sign supports such as poles and braces shall be of a common color;

(2) Signs shall be architecturally integrated with the buildings included in the master sign plan; and

(3) Signs must not obscure the view of other signs that are consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 1598 § 6, 2017; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.007 Variances.

(a) Approval Required. A variance may be granted from the strict application of the regulations in this chapter that apply to: (1) sign placement on a parcel or building frontage; (2) sign area; or (3) sign height, as regulated in this chapter. A variance may not be granted to allow any prohibited signs as described in FMC 22.26.026, or prohibited sign features, as described elsewhere in this chapter, or for any other purpose not listed in this subsection.

(b) Need for Sign Permit, Consolidation of Processing. A sign variance application may be submitted before or concurrent with the associated sign permit application. No sign permit application requiring a variance for issuance will be processed without a sign variance.

(c) A sign variance is classified as a Type III application. The processing procedures for this type of application are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. In addition, a variance requested from any requirement in this chapter shall be processed in accordance with Chapter 22.74 FMC, except that the criteria for variance approval listed in FMC 22.74.003 shall not be used to determine whether a variance may be granted. Instead, a variance may only be approved if all of the following criteria are satisfied:

(1) The request for a sign variance is due to unusual conditions pertaining to sign visibility needs for a specific building or lot;

(2) The sign will be in keeping with the general character of the surrounding area;

(3) The sign will not create a hazard;

(4) The granting of the variance would not be materially detrimental to the property owners in the vicinity;

(5) The variance sought is of minimum sign size, height, and scope to meet the conditions and needs of the applicant;

(6) The granting of the variance would not be contrary to the objectives of the comprehensive plan; this title, Land Development; and this chapter;

(7) The signage of the property in question cannot be adequately met under the literal interpretation and strict application of the chapter; and

(8) The granting of the variance is necessary because of special circumstances relating to the property location, topography, shape and size, sight distance and limited view to property.

(d) First Amendment Exception/Variance. Where an applicant can demonstrate that the strict application of the regulations in this chapter would violate his/her First Amendment rights, the city may grant a variance that does not conform to all of the variance criteria in subsection (c) of this section. However, the applicant shall submit an application that provides his/her response to each of the variance criteria in subsection (c) of this section. The city need not make findings that all of the variance criteria have been satisfied, but if not all criteria have been satisfied, the variance may only be granted to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the applicant’s First Amendment rights. If a First Amendment exception is granted, it shall be treated as an approval of a variance for purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 1598 § 7, 2017; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.008 Nonconforming signs.

(a) Except for temporary signs, as defined herein, signs legally established prior to the adoption of this chapter that do not conform with the regulations provided herein with regard to type, number, size, height, illumination, location or other characteristics shall be allowed to remain as legal nonconforming signs until the sign is removed, moved or structurally or electrically changed, except such signs must be brought into conformance with this chapter:

(1) When a building, tenant space, or property containing a legal nonconforming sign is enlarged or remodeled to a value of 25 percent or more of existing assessed valuation of real property improvements;

(2) When the use of a building, tenant space or property containing a legal nonconforming sign changes from one type of business or other tenancy to another type of business or other tenancy;

(3) When a building or property containing a legal nonconforming sign is vacated for a period exceeding 90 days; or

(4) When an existing business containing a legal nonconforming sign changes ownership. Monument signs and wall signs legally established subsequent to the effective date of Ordinance 1322 (February 5, 2003) are exempt from this requirement.

(b) Nonconforming multi-tenant signs located in a multi-tenant center are not required to be brought into conformance with this chapter per subsection (a) of this section until:

(1) The multi-tenant center is enlarged or remodeled to a value of 25 percent or more of existing assessed valuation of real property improvements;

(2) The multi-tenant center or multi-tenant sign is vacated for a period exceeding 90 days; or

(3) The property changes ownership. Monument signs and wall signs legally established subsequent to the effective date of Ordinance 1322 (February 5, 2003) are exempt from this requirement.

(c) In such cases where a nonconforming sign is moved or changed, the sign shall be treated as a new sign and subject to the requirements of this chapter. Changes to a sign face (e.g., a change in advertising copy) may be made to a nonconforming sign; provided, that such changes conform to this chapter in terms of colors, graphics, materials, illumination and other applicable standards. A sign permit for such changes must be obtained.

(d) Temporary signs, that do not conform with the regulations provided herein with regard to type, number, size, height, illumination, or location of signs, shall be brought into conformance with all applicable standards no later than 90 days from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 1598 § 8, 2017; Ord. 1490 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.009 Maintenance, renewal and enforcement.

(a) Maintenance. It is unlawful for any owner of record, lessor, lessee, manager or other person having lawful possession or control over a building, structure or parcel of land to fail to maintain any signs on the building, structure or parcel in compliance with this chapter.

(1) Sign Maintenance. All signs, whether or not in existence prior to adoption of this chapter, shall be maintained. Maintenance of a sign shall include periodic cleaning, replacement of flickering, burned out or broken light bulbs or fixtures, repair or replacement of any faded, peeled, cracked or otherwise damaged or broken parts of a sign, and any other activity necessary to restore the sign so that it continues to comply with the requirements and contents of the sign permit issued for its installation and provisions of this chapter.

(2) Landscape Maintenance. Required landscaped areas contained by a fixed border, curbed area or other perimeter structure shall receive regular repair and maintenance. Plant materials that do not survive after installation in required landscape areas are required to be replaced within six months of the plant’s demise or within the next planting season, whichever event first occurs.

(b) Removal. Any vacant and/or unused sign support structures, angle irons, sign poles or other remnants of signs that are currently not in use, or are not proposed for immediate reuse by a sign permit application for a permitted sign, shall be removed. In addition to the remedies in Chapter 22.95 FMC, the director shall have the authority to require the repair, maintenance or removal of any sign or sign structure that has become dilapidated or represents a hazard to the safety, health or welfare of the public, at the cost of the sign and/or property owner.

(c) Enforcement. Violations of the provisions of this chapter shall be enforced according to Chapter 22.95 FMC. (Ord. 1598 § 9, 2017; Ord. 1473 § 3, 2009; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).

22.26.011 Sign standards applicable to all signs.

(a) Sign Area. Sign area for all sign types is measured as follows:

(1) Background Panel or Surface. Sign copy mounted, affixed or painted on a background panel or surface distinctively painted, textured or constructed as a background for the sign copy is measured as that area contained within the smallest square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, or circle that will enclose the sign copy and the background, as shown in Figure 1. For an irregular-shaped sign, the sign area may be calculated by combining two or more geometric shapes.

Figure 1

(2) Individual Letters or Graphics. Sign copy mounted as individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia or parapet of a building or surface of another structure, that has not been painted, textured or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is measured as the sum of the smallest square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle or circle that will enclose each word, name, sentence and complete message, and each graphic in the sign. For sign copy that has varying sizes of letters or graphics, the sign area may be calculated by combining two or more geometric shapes.

(3) Illuminated Surface. Sign copy mounted, affixed or painted on an illuminated surface or illuminated element of a building or structure is measured as the entire illuminated surface or illuminated element that contains sign copy, as shown in Figure 2. Such elements may include, but are not limited to, lit canopy fascia signs and/or interior lit awnings.


[IMAGE]


Figure 2

(4) Backlit Translucent Panels. Backlit translucent panels and spandrels, with or without text or graphics, are measured as the area of the height and width of any internally illuminated translucent panel, including the side panels if the structure or spandrel is greater than six inches in width.

(5) Multi-Face Signs. Multi-face signs, as shown in Figure 3, are measured as follows:

(A) Two-Face Signs. If the interior angle between the two sign faces is 45 degrees or less, the sign area is of one sign face only. If the angle between the two sign faces is greater than 45 degrees, the sign area is the sum of the areas of the two sign faces;

(B) Three- or Four-Face Signs. The sign area is 50 percent of the sum of the areas of all sign faces; and

(C) Spherical, free-form, sculptural or other nonplanar sign area is measured as 50 percent of the sum of the areas using only the four vertical sides of the smallest four-sided polyhedron that will encompass the sign structure. Signs with greater than four polyhedron faces are prohibited.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3

(b) Sign Height Measurement for Freestanding Signs. Sign height is measured as the vertical distance from natural grade at the base of a sign to the top of the sign, including the sign support structure; except that signs within 15 feet of an adjacent road may be measured as follows:

(1) If natural grade at the base of a sign is higher than the grade of the adjacent road, sign height shall be measured from the base of the sign as shown in Figure 4.


[IMAGE]


Figure 4

(2) If natural grade at the base of the sign is lower than the grade of an adjacent road, the height of the sign shall be measured from the top of curb or road-grade elevation; provided, that fill is placed between the curb and the sign and extends at least five feet beyond the base of the sign in all directions, as shown in Figure 5.


[IMAGE]


Figure 5

(c) Sign Structure and Installation.

(1) Support Elements. Any angle iron, bracing, guy wires or similar features used to support a sign shall not be visible.

(2) Electrical Service. When electrical service is provided to freestanding signs or landscape wall signs, all such electrical service is required to be underground and concealed. Electrical service to building-mounted wall signs, including conduit, housings and wire, shall be concealed or, when necessary, painted to match the surface of the structure upon which they are mounted. A building permit (electrical) must be issued prior to the installation of any new signs requiring electrical service.

(3) Raceway Cabinets. Raceway cabinets, where used as an element of building-mounted wall signs, shall match the building color at the location of the building where the sign is located. Where a raceway cabinet provides a contrast background to sign copy, the colored area is considered part of the sign face and is counted in the aggregate sign area permitted for the site or business. Examples of raceway cabinets are shown in Figure 6.


[IMAGE]


Figure 6

(4) Limitation on Attachments and Secondary Uses. All permitted sign structures and their associated landscape areas shall be kept free of supplemental attachments or secondary uses including, but not limited to, supplemental signs not part of a permitted sign, light fixture, newspaper distribution racks or trash container. The use of sign structures and associated landscape areas as bicycle racks or support structures for outdoor signs is prohibited.

(d) Sign Placement.

(1) Signs shall not be placed or erected on or over any public street, public alley, or any other public property including rights-of-way or utility easements within the corporate limits of the city, except as expressly provided for in this chapter. Any sign placed upon private property shall require the permission of the property owner.

(2) No sign shall be erected or placed in a manner that will block or impair or impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic on streets, alleys, driveways, or points of ingress-egress, or conflict with the clear vision triangle standards in FMC 22.58.005.

(3) No sign may be mounted, attached or painted on a trailer, boat or motor vehicle that is parked, stored or displayed conspicuously on private premises in a manner intended to attract the attention of the public. This excludes signs that are permanently painted or wrapped on the surface of the vehicle, or adhesive vinyl film affixed to the interior or exterior surface of a vehicle window, or signs magnetically attached to motor vehicles or rolling stock that are actively used in the daily conduct of business. However, such vehicles shall be operable and parked in a lawful or authorized manner. (Ord. 1598 § 11, 2017; Ord. 1533 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.012 Illumination standards.

(a) General. No temporary sign may be illuminated. No sign located in Group 2 (residential) may be illuminated. Permanent signs allowed by this chapter may be nonilluminated, or illuminated by internal light fixtures, halo illuminated, or have external indirect illumination, unless otherwise specified. All illuminated signs shall comply with the time limitations of subsection (d) of this section.

(b) Externally Illuminated Signs.

(1) Except as provided in this subsection, externally illuminated signs shall be illuminated only with steady, stationary, fully shielded light sources directed solely onto the sign without causing glare. Light shielding shall ensure that the lamp or light source is not visible beyond the premises and shall further ensure that the light is contained within the sign face.

(2) A light fixture mounted above the sign face may be installed with its bottom opening tilted toward the sign face, provided:

(A) The bottom opening of the light fixture is flat (i.e., it could be covered by a flat board allowing no light to escape); and

(B) The uppermost portion of the fixture’s opening is located no higher than the top of the sign face, as shown in Figure 7 below. Light fixtures aimed and installed in this fashion shall be considered fully shielded.

(g) Digital Signage Integration. Digital signage elements may be integrated into any freestanding sign or wall sign permitted in this section, provided no more than 50 percent of allowed sign copy area, not to exceed 16 square feet, may be used for digital purposes.

(h) Location. Digital signs may be permitted in Group 1 (nonresidential/noncommercial) and in Group 3 (commercial). (Ord. 1598 § 16, 2017; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.017 Freestanding signs.

(a) Number. The number of freestanding signs for single- and multiple-tenant uses is derived from the location and length of development site frontage as described below:

(1) One freestanding sign for each 150 feet of site frontage up to a maximum of three freestanding signs per frontage. Flag lot sites with frontage on a public street are permitted one sign only on the frontage providing primary access to the site.

(2) For properties with more than 300 feet of frontage and two or more freestanding signs, such signs shall be separated by at least 150 feet.

(3) Where more than one freestanding sign is proposed on a site with multiple frontages, a minimum of 60 linear feet shall separate a sign on one frontage from a sign on another frontage.

(b) Sign Form. Signs shall be designed so they appear firmly anchored to the ground. Examples include monument signs and other signs where the sign base has a minimum aggregate width of 40 percent of the sign cabinet or face, as shown in Figure 12.


[IMAGE]


Figure 12

(c) Placement.

(1) A minimum of five feet from the property line abutting a street, a minimum of 10 feet from any interior side lot line, or a minimum of 25 feet from any Group 1 (nonresidential or noncommercial) or Group 2 (residential) properties.

(2) No freestanding sign shall be located in a manner that will block or impair or impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic on streets, alleys, driveways, or points of ingress-egress, or conflict with the clear vision triangle standards in FMC 22.58.005.

(d) Materials and Design. Signs shall be designed as an integrated architectural feature of the site as described and illustrated in Figures 13 and 14 below:

(1) Framing. Signs must include design elements that effectively frame the sign on both sides. Alternatively, signs that have a substantial framing element on one side will meet this provision;

(2) Materials and Design. Signs shall include durable high quality materials and a design that relates to and/or complements the design of on-site buildings and/or is coordinated with other site design elements (such as distinctive lighting, monuments, internal signs); and

(3) Top/Middle/Bottom. Signs shall integrate a top, middle, and bottom element. The top should include a distinctive sign cap. The middle should include a consistent framing technique for an individual sign or multiple signs in a multi-tenant center. The bottom should include a distinctive base design with special materials and/or design. These elements are less critical for signs less than six feet tall, which are exempt from this provision.

Figure 15

Unacceptable signs

The sign on the left includes a base and a frame, but no identifiable top.

The middle sign and sign on the right fail to meet any of the design provisions above.

(e) Landscaping.

(1) Landscaping is required around the base of freestanding signs to enhance the character of street frontages. At least one square foot of landscaped area shall be provided per one square foot of sign area. Utilize plants and a maintenance program to minimize conflicts with the sign.

(2) Base Height Provision. The copy of all signage shall be at least one foot above grade to allow vertical space for the required landscape elements and enhance the visibility of sign copy. See Figure 16.


[IMAGE]


Figure 16

(f) Area and Height.

(1) Table 2 illustrates the maximum allowable sign area and height for all freestanding signs.

Table 2 

	Total ROW Frontage of Parcel (on each street)	Allowable Sign Area (white, very light or unshaded background)	Allowable Sign Area (black, dark or shaded background)	Maximum Height (white, very light or unshaded background)	Maximum Height (black, dark or shaded background)

	<100 feet	24 sq. ft.	40 sq. ft.	4 feet	6 feet

	100 – 275 feet	32 sq. ft.	50 sq. ft.	5 feet	7 feet

	>275 feet	40 sq. ft.	60 sq. ft.	6 feet	8 feet

(2) Signs that employ shaded, opaque or dark background and light colored lettering for at least 50 percent of the sign copy are allowed larger sign areas, as they are found to be less visually intrusive than signs incorporating white or very light-colored background. Using a CMYK color chart, signs that employ color numbers that add up to at least 20 (collectively) shall be considered as “shaded.” For example:

	C=0,	M=0,	Y=0,	K=20	=	Shaded

	C=10,	M=0,	Y=0,	K=10	=	Shaded

	C=10,	M=0,	Y=0,	K=0	=	Not considered to be shaded

See Figure 17 below for examples. The black, dark, and shaded signs qualify for the extra sign area and height specified in the shaded columns of Table 2. The sign on the right with the white background is allowed but does not qualify for the “bonus” sign area and height and is subject to the sign area/height limits in the unshaded columns in Table 2.


[IMAGE]


Figure 17

(3) For those properties where more than one freestanding sign is allowed on a particular frontage per subsection (a) of this section, one sign may be installed per standards specified per the total ROW frontage of the parcel. The size and height of additional signs are based on the separation from the larger primary sign or other supplemental sign. For example, if a second sign is 250 feet from the larger primary sign, then it shall meet the standards for a sign that includes 100 through 299 feet of total ROW frontage of parcel as set forth in Table 2.

(g) Address Numbers. Legible address numbers are required on all freestanding signs. Such address numbers are exempt from sign area standards.

(h) Location. Freestanding signs may be permitted in Group 1 (nonresidential/noncommercial) and Group 3 (commercial). (Ord. 1598 § 17, 2017; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2003).


22.26.018 Portable signs.

Portable signs must be designed to withstand wind and include a heavy weighted base for pole-mounted signs, and a heavy weight suspended between the opposing faces of a sandwich board sign.

(c) Size and Height (See Figure 18).

(1) Sandwich Board Signs. Maximum four feet in height and three feet in width. (Note: sandwich board sign height is measured in the flat standing position, rather than in open standing position.)

(2) Pole-Mounted Signs. Maximum four feet in height and three feet in width.

(3) Feather Signs. Maximum 13 feet in height.


[IMAGE]


Figure 18

(d) Number, Location and Spacing.

[IMAGE]


Figure 19

Feather signs shall be placed at intervals of no more than one sign per 100 lineal feet of frontage and located behind the sidewalk outside the public ROW.

(e) Placement. No portable sign may be located on city right-of-way, including sidewalk, without city approval. Such signs shall not be placed within a clear vision triangle (see FMC 22.58.005) or any location that will impede vehicular traffic. Further, such signs shall not be placed in a manner that will block or otherwise obstruct the safe use of sidewalks, building entrances or stairs by pedestrians, including pedestrians who are visually impaired or otherwise handicapped.

(f) Display Hours. During business or operating hours only.

(g) Location. Portable signs (durable and temporary) may be permitted in Group 1 (nonresidential/noncommercial) and Group 3 (commercial), and temporary portable signs may be permitted in Group 2 (residential). Temporary portable signs are subject to the provisions of FMC 22.26.021. Feather signs are permitted only in the CMU zone.

(h) Visually Obscured Building Signage. In order to provide increased visibility for businesses and other tenants located in buildings that are visually obscured from public street frontage by an intervening building, sandwich or pole-mounted signs may be placed along the arterial street frontage in lieu of these signs being placed within 12 feet of the primary entrance to the rear building or business, subject to the following limitations:

(1) The property is located within a CMU or NC zone.

(2) Signs shall be placed on private property subject to the property owner’s permission.

(3) The number of signs shall be limited to one per tenant.

(4) Spacing shall be no closer than 40 feet apart to minimize their visual impact. (Ord. 1598 § 18, 2017).

This district provides opportunities for a broad mix of retail and office uses, personal, professional and business services, institutions, recreational and cultural uses, residential uses, and other facilities that provide services for the needs of nearby residents and businesses and the surrounding community. In addition, the commercial mixed use district provides limited opportunities for light industrial activities that enhance the city’s economic base and provide employment for residents in the area in a manner that is compatible with neighboring commercial and residential uses. Site and building design encourage pedestrian, bicycle and transit use while accommodating automobiles. Community plazas and other publicly accessible spaces are incorporated into mixed use developments that include a variety of complementary uses. High quality architecture, landscaping, hardscape, artwork and other public amenities contribute to making the area inviting, attractive, functional and vibrant for residents, employees and visitors alike.

	> floor level of first floor	None allowed.

	Calculations resulting in a fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with .50 being rounded up.

(5) Uncovered wheelchair ramps or other structures providing disabled access may encroach into any required yard as long as the access structure provides continuous access from the street or parking area to an entrance of the structure that it is designed to serve. The encroachment shall be the minimum necessary to provide safe and adequate access and shall be subject to administrative design review.

(6) Balconies that are less than or equal to 50 square feet in area, have no exterior access, and are cantilevered or supported from the structure, may extend three feet into a required front, rear or side street side yard. The balcony shall not project more than six feet from the supporting wall to the furthest outward extension. Overhead projections shall provide at least seven and one-half feet of unobstructed vertical clearance above grade. Any balcony that does not meet the above criteria shall be considered an uncovered porch subject to the standards in subsection (b)(4) of this section.

(7) A detached accessory building, including but not limited to a garage, carport or garden shed, may be located in a required side or rear yard, subject to the specific standards specified in FMC 22.58.003.

(8) A fence meeting the standards specified in FMC 22.58.004 may be located in a required yard. Fences exceeding these height limits must be located within the allowable building envelope for the principal residential structure.

(9) Arbors, pergolas, trellises and similar structures, either freestanding or attached to a principal or accessory building, may be constructed in any required yard; provided, that a minimum three-foot setback is maintained. A structural connection between these structures and a fence located at or near a property line is permitted, provided the connecting structure does not exceed the height limit that applies to a fence in the required yard.

(10) Porches, patio covers, gazebos and similar covered, unenclosed structures may be constructed in a required rear yard; provided, that a minimum 10-foot rear setback and a standard side yard setback are maintained.

(11) Swimming pools and spas (above and in ground) and related equipment, fish ponds, stationary barbecues, children’s play equipment, and HVAC equipment, may be placed in any required side or rear yard; provided, that a minimum three-foot setback is maintained.

(12) Flagpoles may be placed within any required yard; provided, that a minimum five-foot setback is maintained.

(c) Setback Reduction for Residential Front Yard. A required front yard setback for a principal residential structure may be decreased to a depth that is equal to the average of the setbacks of existing principal residential structures on the adjoining parcels having the same frontage. In computing the average, any adjoining setback greater than the required front yard shall be considered the same as the required front yard setback. In the absence of a principal residential structure on an adjoining parcel, the parcel shall be considered to have a setback equal to the required front yard. In computing the average for corner lots, the adjoining setback on the side street side shall be the same as the required front yard. For each foot of front yard setback reduction, the rear yard setback shall be increased a corresponding distance from the minimum required setback.

(d) Setback from Adjoining Half-Street or Designated Arterial. In addition to providing the standard setback from a property line abutting a street, a lot adjoining a half-street or designated arterial shall provide an additional width of street setback sufficient to accommodate construction of the planned half-street or arterial.

(e) Common Boundary Exception to Setback Requirements. When the common boundary line separating two contiguous lots in any zoning district is covered by a single building or permitted group of buildings, these lots shall constitute a single building site and the setback required by this title shall not apply to the common boundary line.

(f) Special Side Yard Setback Restriction. When the side lot line of a lot in any zoning district adjoins the side lot line of a lot in a more restrictive district, then the adjoining side yard setback for this lot shall not be less than the minimum side yard setback required in the more restrictive district.

(g) Setbacks for Personal Wireless Telecommunication Facilities. See Chapter 22.24 FMC.

(h) Setbacks for Amateur or Citizen Band Transmitters. Support structure setback is equal to overall height of support structure plus height of antenna array. Support structures are prohibited in front yards.

(i) Setback for Flag Lot Front Yards. The front yard setback for a flag lot shall be a minimum of 10 feet measured from the nearest parallel or nearly parallel lot line adjacent to the front facade of the dwelling. See Figure 1.

22.58.003 Accessory buildings.

(a) One or more detached accessory buildings, including, but not limited to, garages, carports, garden sheds, greenhouses and other similar structures, may be constructed on a parcel containing a principal residential structure, subject to the following standards:

	Maximum building footprint area	600 sf.

	Maximum lot coverage	10% of the lot area or 1,000 sf, whichever is less, for all accessory buildings combined on a single lot.

	Maximum building height	18 feet at top of ridge and 10 feet at top of wall.

	Minimum front yard setback	Same as specified for principal residential structure.

	Minimum interior side yard setback	5 feet.

	Minimum side street side yard setback on a corner lot	Same as specified for principal residential structure if building permit required, otherwise 5 feet.

	Minimum rear yard setback	5 feet.

	Minimum setback from “rear” lot line of a “through lot”	Same as specified for required front yard for principal residential structure if building permit required, otherwise 5 feet.

	Minimum setback from alley 	5 feet. Vehicle access points from garages, carports or fenced parking areas shall be set back from the alley property line to provide a straight-line separation of at least 22 feet from the access point to the opposite property line of the alley. No portion of the garage or the door in motion may cross the property line abutting the alley.

	Minimum separation from principal residential structure	5 feet. Note: the building code may require additional separation based on construction design.

	Calculations resulting in a fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with .50 being rounded up.

(b) Exceptions to Building Footprint Area, Height and Lot Coverage Limits. The director may grant an administrative use permit for a building that exceeds the building footprint, height or lot coverage standards listed in subsection (a) of this section if it finds that:

(1) The building and its use will not significantly impact adjoining properties;

(2) The architecture will incorporate exterior finish materials and design elements consistent with, or superior to, that of the principal residential structure on the property;

(3) The building will fit the character of the neighborhood;

(4) The architecture complies with the city’s design guidelines;

(5) The building footprint will not exceed 800 square feet, and the building height will not exceed 21 feet at the top of ridge or 12 feet at the top of wall; and

(6) The combined building footprints of existing and proposed accessory buildings on the same lot will not exceed 1,000 square feet.

(c) Determination of Attached Versus Detached Status for Garages. A garage that is connected to a principal residential structure by an architecturally integrated, covered breezeway is classified as an attached garage if the separation between the parallel walls of the garage and principal structure does not exceed eight feet. For purposes of determining allowable setbacks, height and lot coverage, an attached garage is treated as if it were part of the principal structure. If the separation between the parallel walls of a garage and principal structure exceeds eight feet, the garage is classified as a detached building subject to the accessory building standards listed in this section. (Ord. 1616 § 1, 2018; Ord. 1562 § 37, 2015; Ord. 1311 § 26, 2002; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).

(4) Clear vision triangle: two feet, six inches above centerline grades of intersecting streets when a surface area is more than 50 percent opaque (see FMC 22.58.005).

(b) Fences and walls located in a residential zoning district may exceed the preceding height limits if located outside of required yards or within the allowable building envelope for the principal residential structure. Fences and walls may also exceed the limits specified in subsections (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section if they are intended to enclose public school grounds, parks, playgrounds, substations, wells or other municipal installations.

(c) Fences and walls located within a commercial or industrial zoning district may exceed the height limits specified in subsection (a) of this section, provided the fence or wall design complies with the city’s design guidelines.

(d) Fence height is measured from the ground level where placed or from a retaining wall to the top of the fence, excluding posts. On sloping properties where a fence is constructed of sections which are terraced to match the terrain, fence height shall be the average of the high and low points of each fence section. In such instances, portions of the fence may exceed the maximum allowable height; provided, that the average height of the fence section does not exceed the maximum height.

(e) Solid fences or walls higher than two feet within the front yard are prohibited; this does not include hedges. Front yard fences and walls shall have a surface area that is no more than 50 percent opaque. See Figure 2.


[IMAGE]


Figure 2

(f) Fence pillars or posts may project a maximum of one foot above maximum fence height.

(g) An administrative exception may be granted to allow the front yard fence height to exceed the four-foot height limit in subsection (a)(1) of this section if the director finds that:

(1) The principal residential structure existing on the lot at the time of application encroaches into the required front yard.

(2) The proposed fence will not encroach into the required front yard any further than the existing principal residential structure.

(3) The fence will not exceed a maximum height of six feet plus one foot of lattice or other material with a surface area that is no more than 50 percent opaque. See Figure 2.

(4) The fence will not be located within a clear vision triangle.

(h) Fences and walls shall not be located within a public street right-of-way unless a right-of-way encroachment permit is granted by the city. The request shall be processed as a Type 2 permit project application in accordance with Chapter 22.05 FMC. In order to grant a right-of-way encroachment permit, the city shall adopt written findings showing the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(1) The fence or wall will comply with clear vision triangle standards, if applicable.

(2) The placement of the fence or wall will not interfere with underground utilities.

(3) The fence or wall will not compromise public safety by restricting the ability of sidewalk users to avoid conflicts with competing users of the sidewalk.

(4) The property owner will be able to obtain and maintain insurance coverage in the event that a claim is filed relating to the fence or wall. The coverage will be provided at a level determined to be acceptable by the risk manager and city attorney, and the property owner will provide documentation of coverage annually to the city.

(5) The property owner shall, by written agreement to be recorded with the Pierce County auditor, indemnify and hold harmless the city for any claim filed against the property owner for any action or cause for damages that may occur as a result of the encroachment.

(i) All private swimming pools, wading pools, spas and hot tubs shall be provided with a fence or wall to prevent unauthorized access. See FMC 12.04.020(a) for specific standards.

(j) A fence permit is required for all fences located in required front yards, side street side yards, yards adjoining through-lot street frontages, and clear vision triangles.

(k) Hedges are allowed in all required yards subject to the following height limits:

(1) Front yard, interior side yard, side street side yard, and rear yard equals no limit.

(2) Clear vision triangle equals two feet, six inches above centerline grades of intersecting streets. (Ord. 1562 § 38, 2015; Ord. 1469 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1438 § 1, 2007; Ord. 1417 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1311 § 27, 2002; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.005 Clear vision triangle. 

(a) All corner lots located in zoning districts that require a front and side yard shall maintain a clear vision triangle at the intersection of two streets for the purpose of public safety. A clear vision triangle shall also be maintained at the intersection of a street and alley or driveway. No building, structure, object or growth between a height of two feet, six inches and eight feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets shall be allowed within these triangles. 

(b) The clear vision triangle at a street intersection shall be determined by measuring 20 feet along both street property lines beginning at their point of intersection. The third side of the triangle shall be a line connecting the endpoints of the first two sides of the triangle. See Figure 3.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3

(c) The clear vision triangle at the intersection of a street and alley or driveway shall be determined by measuring 10 feet along the street property line and 10 feet along the edges of the alley or driveway beginning at the respective points of intersection. The third side of the triangle shall be a line connecting the endpoints of the first two sides of the triangle. See Figure 3.

(d) The city engineer may allow alteration of the clear vision triangle. This alteration is contingent on unusual site topography, proposed site design features, and other unique circumstances pertaining solely to the site and surrounding properties. The city engineer shall make written findings that the alteration does not constitute a traffic or pedestrian safety hazard.

(e) Street lights, power poles, traffic signs, or other similar street fixtures less than one-foot wide or other objects above eight feet in height above the adjacent street elevation shall be allowed in the clear vision triangle unless the city engineer determines that, individually or cumulatively, they would pose a public safety hazard. The city engineer may authorize other objects in the clear vision triangle that do not comply with this standard if he/she determines that they would not pose a risk to public safety. (Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.006 Garage placement and width. 

(a) The following standards apply to garages attached to single-family, duplex and multifamily dwelling units:

(1) Projection. A garage with doors which face a front yard shall not project in front of the dwelling unit’s facade; provided, that a garage may project in front of the habitable portion of the dwelling unit if a covered porch projects the same or greater distance.

(2) Door Width. Garage doors which face a front yard or a side street side yard shall not exceed 33 percent of the lot width or 18 feet, whichever is less. Individual single bay doors shall not exceed a width of nine feet.

(3) Garage Width. A garage with garage doors that face a front yard or side street side yard shall not exceed 50 percent of the building line or 24 feet, whichever is greater, unless it is designed to appear as habitable space through the use of residential architectural features (see FMC 22.64.023(b)).

(b) Garages attached to dwelling units located on the following types of lots are exempt from the standards listed in subsection (a) of this section:

(1) Flag lots (see FMC 22.98.393, Definitions).

(2) Lots where topography or significant tree retention precludes compliance with the provisions of this section, as determined by the director.

(3) Lots within planned developments granted preliminary development plan approval prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section.

(4) Lots within subdivisions where at least 75 percent of the lots located on the same block face and the block face directly across the street, within 300 feet of the subject property, are occupied by dwelling units with garages which project beyond the facade or which have a garage width or garage door width which exceeds the standards listed in this section.

(5) Undeveloped lots of record existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section that are provided vehicular access solely via a substandard private road having one outlet. (Ord. 1417 § 10, 2006; Ord. 1272 § 7, 2001; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.007 Height exceptions. 

(a) Height exceptions to the applicable zoning district limit shall be limited to the minimum necessary for the intended use. Chimneys, steeples, flag poles, skylights, mechanical equipment and associated screening, fire parapet walls, widow’s walk or other similar item required for building operation or maintenance, and tanks and towers required for public utility purposes may be erected above the required height limit provided they meet the structural requirements of the city.

(b) A residential amateur or citizen band antenna array and support structure may be erected up to the minimum height necessary for reception purposes. If a resident proposes a height greater than 45 feet, the city shall require the applicant to submit certification from a qualified and licensed engineer that the proposed height is the minimum necessary for reception purposes. For a proposed height greater than 55 feet, the city shall, at the applicant’s expense, hire a qualified and licensed engineer to review the applicant’s submittal.

(c) A public or quasi-public utility pole or structure may be erected to a height necessary for proper use. For proposed structures above 45 feet, the city shall require the applicant to submit certification from a qualified and licensed engineer that the proposed height is the minimum necessary for utility purposes. For a proposed height greater than 55 feet, the city shall, at the applicant’s expense, hire a qualified and licensed engineer to review the applicant’s submittal.

(d) A personal wireless service facility may exceed the applicable zoning district height limit provided it is installed in compliance with Chapter 22.24 FMC. (Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.008 Performance standards.

In addition to the specific requirements within the applicable zoning district chapter, the following performance standards shall apply:

(a) Objectionable Elements. No land or building shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable element. An objectionable element may include, but is not limited to: excessive noise, vibration, glare, smoke, dust or odor.

(b) Enclosure of Activities. Unless authorized by the applicable zoning district, all home occupation, commercial and industrial activities shall be conducted within an enclosed structure, except for customary accessory appurtenances, such as refuse collection containers screened from public view, parking and loading areas.

(c) Outside Storage. Unless authorized by the applicable zoning district, outside storage of material for commercial and industrial uses is prohibited. An outside storage area shall not exceed 20 percent of lot area and shall be screened from view from any property line. Outside storage shall be restricted to the area at the rear of a principal building. The outside storage area shall be enclosed by a fence greater than or equal to eight feet in height. Outside storage exceeding a height of eight feet shall be set back from the property line a distance of at least twice the height of material being stored. The height of outside storage shall not exceed twice the height of the fence in this subsection. Outside storage of junk or wrecked vehicles is prohibited. Outside storage of inoperable vehicles may be permitted in residential districts subject to compliance with FMC 22.58.024.

(d) Refuse Collection Containers. For multifamily or nonresidential structures and uses, all outdoor refuse collection containers (including recycling containers) shall be completely screened from public or private streets and from adjacent property by an opaque screen. Refuse storage areas that are visible from the upper stories of adjacent structures shall have an opaque or semi-opaque horizontal cover or screen to mitigate unsightly views. The covering structure shall be compatible with the site’s architecture. The storage of animal or vegetable waste that may attract insects or rodents or otherwise create a potential health hazard is prohibited. Properties undergoing substantial improvement as defined in FMC 22.98.697 shall install new screening or upgrade any existing collection container facilities that do not meet the standards of this section to ensure code consistency upon completion of the redevelopment. For multi-tenant structures, the city’s determination as to whether improvement to an individual tenant space is considered to be a substantial improvement will be based on the value of the improvements relative to the assessed valuation of the tenant space, or a comparable judgment if an individual tenant space assessment is unavailable.

(e) Maintenance of Yards and Open Space. All required structures, yards, parking areas and other open areas on site shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times appropriate for the zoning district. Yards and open areas shall be maintained, as the responsibility of the property owner, free of any hazards to health or safety. Except for permitted earth-disturbing activity, all ground areas shall be maintained in a manner ensuring that the natural or landscaped vegetation or permitted impervious surfaces provide a durable and dust-free covering at all times. Dumping or storage of junk or debris, including junk vehicles or wrecked vehicles, is prohibited.

(f) Utilities. For new development, or existing development which is being expanded by greater than or equal to 50 percent of its existing gross floor area, all utilities shall be located underground; provided, that electrical lines of 50,000 volts or greater may be placed aboveground. The construction of a new single-family residence on an infill lot located within a subdivision where electric service is typically provided from an overhead location may be exempted from this requirement by the public works director if he/she determines that the undergrounding of electric facilities for this lot would be impractical.

(g) Screening of Mechanical Equipment. All roof-mounted air conditioning or heating equipment, vents or ducts shall not be visible from the ground level of any abutting parcel or any public rights-of-way. This shall be accomplished through the extension of the main structure or roof or screening in a manner that is architecturally integrated with the main structure. The screening may require acoustical treatment to mitigate noise generation.

(h) Barbed or Razor Wire. Barbed, razor or similar security wire may be authorized by the city for municipal facilities, if the fence on which the wire is placed will be effectively screened by landscaping. Barbed or razor wire is prohibited in all other locations and zoning districts.

(i) Erosion and Sedimentation. A temporary erosion and sedimentation control plan detailing measures for controlling erosion and sediment-laden runoff shall be submitted for approval by the director prior to issuance of a clearing and grading permit or other construction permit for a project. Measures shall include provisions to remove depositions of soil and material from streets and to prevent discharge of soil and materials onto adjoining properties or environmentally sensitive areas. The plan shall be implemented by the applicant before and during construction, and the applicant’s performance shall be monitored by the city. The plan shall be upgraded as deemed necessary by the director to ensure effective control during construction.

(j) Particulates. During site development activities, construction dust and other particulates shall be controlled through frequent watering and/or other dust control measures approved by the director. Reclaimed water shall be used whenever practicable. Soil that is transported in trucks to and from the construction site shall be covered to the extent practicable to prevent particulates from being released.

(k) Stormwater Management. Stormwater facilities shall be designed in accordance with the standards set forth in Chapter 20.24 FMC. Stormwater site plans demonstrating compliance with stormwater management standards shall be submitted for approval by the director and city engineer prior to issuance of site development permits.

(l) Contaminants. During site development activities, all releases of oils, hydraulic fluids, fuels, other petroleum products, paints, solvents, and other deleterious materials shall be contained and removed in a manner that will prevent their discharge to waters and soils of the state. The cleanup of spills shall take precedence over other work on the site. (Ord. 1640 § 5, 2019; Ord. 1562 § 39, 2015; Ord. 1311 § 28, 2002; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.009 Manufactured homes.   

A manufactured home is permitted in any zoning district that permits a single-family residence. The placement of a manufactured home is subject to the same zoning regulations and environmental standards that are required for construction of a conventional site-built single-family residence regulated by the International Building Code. A manufactured home shall be permanently set on a foundation, consistent with the foundation requirements for manufactured housing, and shall include a perimeter fascia that looks similar to a foundation for a site-built home, as determined by the director. A manufactured home shall comply with the city’s infill housing design guidelines, when applicable. (Ord. 1473 § 4, 2009; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).

(c) Be certified by the office of childcare policy licensor as providing a safe passenger loading area;

(d) Comply with Chapter 22.26 FMC, Sign Regulations;

(e) Prior to state licensing, the proposed provider shall submit proof to the director that the provider notified the immediately adjoining property owners about the intent to locate and maintain a family day-care facility. Adequate proof shall consist of a copy of a detailed letter submitted to the adjoining neighbors, along with a signed certification of delivery and/or a written letter from the adjoining neighbors indicating that they have received proper notification. (Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.011 Short-term rental establishments.

(a) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to:

(1) Provide property owners and residents with an opportunity to use their homes to engage in small-scale business activities.

(2) Protect neighborhood character and stability.

(3) Establish criteria and standards for the use of residential structures as short-term rentals.

(b) Permit Requirements. A short-term rental establishment may be carried on upon the issuance of a business license pursuant to Chapter 5.04 FMC and the issuance of a short-term rental permit by the director.

(c) Submittal Requirements. Application for a short-term rental permit shall be made upon forms provided by the director, accompanied by a filing fee in accordance with the planning services fee schedule established by council resolution. The application shall be signed by the owner of the property on which the short-term rental activity will occur. The application shall also be signed by the business operator if that person is different from the property owner. The director may require the submittal of a site plan of the premises, floor plans of the residence or accessory building in which the use or activity will take place, and other documentation deemed necessary to process the application. The plans shall clearly indicate the area where the use or activity will take place and any structural alterations intended to accommodate the use or activity.

(d) Short-Term Rental Types Defined. The following definitions apply to the short-term rental types allowed through the provisions of this section:

(1) “Room rental establishment” means a lodging use, where individual rooms within a single dwelling unit are provided for less than 30 consecutive days for a fee by prearrangement. This shall include bed and breakfast establishments.

(7) One off-street parking space shall be provided on site for each rental bedroom. The number of required off-street spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces available on the street frontage adjoining the parcel upon which the room rental is to be established, if the decision-maker determines that sufficient on-street parking will exist to satisfy parking demand in the neighborhood once the room rental has been established. Any additional off-street parking provided in conjunction with the room rental shall, to the extent possible, be located to the side or rear of the structure housing the room rental in order to minimize visual impacts on the streetscape. Off-street parking shall be designed to reduce impacts on adjoining properties through the installation of vegetative screening and/or fencing. The parking surface and additional driveway surface required to provide access to the parking area shall be constructed of permeable, porous or pervious pavers to achieve low impact development objectives and a superior appearance when compared with conventional asphalt or concrete pavement.

(3) Only one ADU may be created per principal unit.

(4) The property owner, which shall include title holders and contract purchasers, must occupy either the principal unit or the ADU as their permanent residence, but not both, and at no time receive rent for the owner-occupied unit.

(5) An ADU may be developed in either an existing or a new single-family residence.

(6) An attached ADU shall not exceed 800 square feet; provided, if the ADU is completely located on a single floor of a multistory building, the director may allow increased size in order to efficiently use all floor area. A detached ADU shall comply with accessory building size limits and related standards listed in FMC 22.58.003.

(7) An attached ADU shall be designed to maintain the architectural design, style, appearance and character of the principal unit as a single-family residence. If an attached ADU extends beyond the current footprint or existing height of the principal unit, or requires modifications to the exterior of the building, the addition or modifications must be consistent with the existing facade, roof pitch, siding, windows, and other exterior design elements and finish materials. A detached ADU shall use the same design vocabulary as the principal unit to the extent feasible.

(8) Only one entrance is permitted to be located on the front facade of the principal unit. If a separate outside entrance is necessary for an attached ADU, it must be located either on the rear or side of the principal unit. This entrance shall be located in such a manner as to be unobtrusive from the same view of the building that encompasses the main entrance to the principal unit.

(9) No additional off-street parking is required for an ADU unless the director determines that insufficient on-street parking will exist to satisfy parking demand in the neighborhood once the ADU has been occupied. Any additional off-street parking provided in conjunction with the ADU shall, to the extent possible, be located to the side or rear of the principal unit to minimize visual impacts on the streetscape. Off-street parking shall be designed to reduce impacts on adjoining properties through the installation of vegetative screening and/or fencing. The parking surface shall be constructed of a permeable surface such as interlocking paving blocks (cement or plastic) or other porous pavement which minimizes impervious surface and provides a superior appearance when compared with asphalt or concrete paving. For additional off-street parking standards, see Chapter 22.60 FMC.

(10) In order to encourage the development of housing units for people with disabilities, the director may allow reasonable deviation from the requirements of this section when necessary to install features that facilitate accessibility. These facilities shall conform to Washington State regulations for barrier-free facilities.

(11) An ADU shall be connected to the utilities of the principal unit and may not have separate water, sewer and electrical services.

(12) The total number of occupants in both the principal unit and ADU combined may not exceed the maximum number established by the definition of “family” in FMC 22.98.267.

(13) A registration form or other forms required by the director shall be filed as a deed restriction with the Pierce County auditor to indicate the presence of the ADU, the requirement of owner-occupancy, and other standards for maintaining the unit as described above.

(d) Legalization of Nonconforming ADUs. Nonconforming ADUs existing prior to the enactment of these requirements may be found to be legal if the property owner applies for an ADU permit prior to one year after enactment of this section and brings the unit up to minimum housing code standards. No penalty fees or fines will be assessed by the city for legalization submittals made prior to this date. After one year after enactment of this section, an owner of an illegal ADU shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000, including all statutory costs, assessments, and fees, plus $75.00 per day after notice of this violation has been met. An owner of an illegal ADU shall also be required to either legalize the unit or remove it.

(D) Analyses and illuminance level diagrams showing that the proposed installation conforms to the lighting level standards in this section.

(E) Drawings of all relevant building elevations showing the fixtures, the portions of the walls to be illuminated, the illuminance levels of the walls, and the aiming points for any remote light fixtures.

(4) Wherever practicable, lighting installations shall include timers, dimmers, and/or sensors to reduce overall energy consumption and eliminate unneeded lighting.

(5) When an outdoor lighting installation is being modified, extended, expanded, or added to, the entire outdoor lighting installation shall be subject to the requirements of this section.

(6) Expansions, additions, or replacements to outdoor lighting installations shall be designed to avoid harsh contrasts in color and/or lighting levels.

(7) Electrical service to outdoor lighting fixtures shall be underground unless the fixtures are mounted directly on utility poles.

(8) Proposed lighting installations that are not covered by the special provisions in this section may be approved only if the planning commission or director finds that they are designed to minimize glare, do not direct light beyond the boundaries of the area being illuminated or onto adjacent properties or streets, and do not result in excessive lighting levels.

(9) For the purposes of these regulations, the mounting height of a lighting fixture shall be defined as the vertical distance from the grade elevation of the surface being illuminated to the bottom of the lighting fixture (i.e., luminaire).

(10) Holiday lighting during the months of November, December and January shall be exempt from the provisions of this section; provided, that such lighting does not create dangerous glare on adjacent streets or properties.

(11) The planning commission or director may modify the requirements of this section if it determines that in so doing it will not jeopardize achievement of the intent of these regulations.

(c) Parking Lot Lighting. Parking lot lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum lighting necessary to ensure adequate vision and comfort in parking areas, and to not cause glare or direct illumination onto adjacent properties or streets.

(1) All lighting fixtures serving parking lots shall be cut-off fixtures as defined by the Illuminating Engineer Society of North America (IESNA).

(2) Alternatives. The design for an area may suggest the use of parking lot lighting fixtures of a particular “period” or architectural style, as either alternatives or supplements to the lighting described above.

(A) If such fixtures are not “cut-off” fixtures as defined by IESNA, the maximum initial lumens generated by each fixture shall not exceed 2,000 (equivalent to a 150-watt incandescent bulb).

(B) Mounting heights of such alternative fixtures shall not exceed 15 feet.

(3) Parking area lighting standards in the various lighting districts are shown in Table 1.

(d) Lighting of Service Station/Convenience Store Aprons and Canopies. Lighting levels on service station/convenience store aprons and under canopies shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place in such locations. Lighting of such areas shall not be used to attract attention to the businesses. Signs allowed under Chapter 22.26 FMC shall be used for that purpose.

(1) Areas on the apron away from the fuel pump islands used for parking or vehicle storage shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements for parking areas in subsection (c) of this section. If no fuel pumps are provided, the entire apron shall be treated as a parking area.

(2) Areas around the pump islands and under canopies shall be illuminated so that the minimum horizontal illuminance at grade level is at least one foot-candle and no more than five and one-half foot-candles. The uniformity ratio (ratio of average to minimum illuminance) shall be no greater than four to one, which yields an average illumination level of no more than 22 foot-candles.

(3) Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy and/or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy so that light is restrained to no more than 85 degrees from vertical, as shown in the figure below.


[IMAGE]


(4) As an alternative (or supplement) to recessed ceiling lights, indirect lighting may be used where light is beamed upward and then reflected down from the underside of the canopy. In this case light fixtures must be shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the underside of the canopy.

(5) Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides (fascias) of the canopy, and the sides (fascias) of the canopy shall not be illuminated.

(e) Lighting of Exterior Display/Sales Areas. Lighting levels on exterior display/sales areas shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place in such locations. Lighting of such areas shall not be used to attract attention to the businesses. Signs allowed under Chapter 22.26 FMC shall be used for that purpose. The applicant shall designate areas to be considered display/sales areas and areas to be used as parking or passive vehicle storage areas. This designation must be approved by the planning commission or director.

(1) Areas designated as parking or passive vehicle storage areas shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements for parking areas in subsection (c) of this section.

(2) Areas designated as exterior display/sales areas shall be illuminated so that the average horizontal illuminance at grade level is no more than five foot-candles. The uniformity ratio (ratio of average to minimum illuminance) shall be no greater than four to one. The average and minimum shall be computed for only that area designated as exterior display/sales area.

(3) Light fixtures shall meet the IESNA definition of cut-off fixtures, and shall be located, mounted, aimed, and shielded so that direct light is not cast onto adjacent streets or properties.

(4) Fixtures shall be mounted no more than 25 feet above grade, and mounting poles shall be located either inside the illuminated area or no more than 10 feet away from the outside edge of the illuminated area.

(f) Lighting of Outdoor Performance or Sports. Outdoor nighttime performance events (concerts, athletic contests, etc.) have unique lighting needs. Illumination levels vary, depending on the nature of the event. The regulations in this section are intended to allow adequate lighting for such events while minimizing sky glow, reducing glare and unwanted illumination of surrounding streets and properties, and reducing energy consumption.

(1) Design Plan. A lighting design plan shall be submitted that shows in detail the proposed lighting installation. The design plan shall include a discussion of the lighting requirements of various areas and how those requirements will be met.

(2) Dual System. The main lighting of the event (spotlighting or floodlighting, etc.) shall be turned off no more than 45 minutes after the end of the event. A low level lighting system shall be installed to facilitate patrons leaving the facility, cleanup, nighttime maintenance, etc. The low level lighting system shall provide an average horizontal illumination level, at grade level, of no more than three foot-candles with a uniformity ratio (average to minimum) not exceeding four to one.

(3) Primary Playing Areas. Where playing fields or other special activity areas are to be illuminated, lighting fixtures shall be specified, mounted, and aimed so that their beams fall within the primary playing area and immediate surroundings, and so that no direct illumination is directed off the site.

22.58.020 Development agreement.

(a) Hearing Examiner and City Council Authority. The hearing examiner is hereby authorized to conduct a public hearing for the consideration of a development agreement subject to RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.200. The hearing examiner shall transmit its recommendations on the proposed agreement to the city council. The city council is hereby authorized to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a proposed development agreement after considering the hearing examiner’s recommendations at a closed record hearing.

(b) Application. Development agreement applications must be submitted on forms provided by the director. The director may require any additional information necessary in order for the city to adequately review the proposed agreement.

(c) Required Findings. In addition to any required findings for the underlying action, the city council must be able to find that a development agreement:

(1) Bears a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals and welfare;

(2) Is consistent with the city’s development regulations; and

(3) Is consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1638 § 26, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.021 Voluntary agreement.

(a) An applicant may enter into a voluntary agreement with the city to allow a payment in lieu of dedication of land or to mitigate a direct impact that has been identified as a consequence of a proposed development, subdivision, or plat. The voluntary agreement shall not be used for open space required to be in buffer yards, stormwater facilities, sensitive area management tracts, wetland buffers, required landscaping or any other open space required to be on-site. 

(b) Payment Calculations and Provisions.

(1) Calculation for Payment in Lieu of Land Dedication. The payment in lieu of dedication of land shall be calculated based on the assessed land value of the entire property within the proposed development, subdivision, or plat. The assessed land value shall be the amount on record with the Pierce County assessor’s office on the date when a complete project permit application is received by the director or the calendar year of final subdivision or plat approval. The payment shall be calculated by multiplying the percentage of total land that would have been dedicated by the applicant times the above mentioned assessed land value.

(2) Calculation for Payment in Lieu of Mitigation. The payment in lieu of mitigation shall be based on the actual cost of the proposed mitigation. The applicant shall submit a cost estimate for the proposed mitigation to the director for review and approval. The director may rely on other cost estimates or information if the applicant’s estimate is not acceptable. 

(3) Payment Provisions. The voluntary agreement is subject to the following provisions: 

(A) The payment shall be received by the city prior to the issuance of a project permit or approval of a final subdivision or plat.

(B) The payment shall be held in a reserve account and may only be expended to fund a purchase or improvement of open space within 3,000 feet of the perimeter of the project site or expansion or improvement to a citywide park.

(C) The payment shall be expended in all cases within five years of collection.

 

(D) Any payment not so expended shall be refunded with interest at the rate applied to judgements to the property owners of record at the time of the refund. However, if the payment is not expended within five years due to delay attributable to the developer, the payment shall be refunded without interest. (Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.022 Siting of essential public facilities.

The purpose of this section is to establish and describe the city’s process for identifying and siting essential public facilities. Essential public facilities include but are not limited to those facilities that are difficult to site, such as airports, state educational facilities, state and regional transportation facilities, state and local correctional facilities, solid waste handling facilities and in-patient facilities (including substance abuse, mental health and group home facilities). The Growth Management Act mandates that no local development regulation may preclude the siting of essential public facilities.

(a) Identification. The city recognizes the list of essential state public facilities, which is maintained and updated by the State Office of Financial Management. The director is authorized to determine if any additional proposed use within the city is an essential public facility.

(b) Siting. If an essential public facility is listed as either a permitted or conditional use within a zoning district, the use is restricted to those zoning districts. If an essential public facility is not expressly listed as either a permitted or conditional use within a zoning district, then the use shall be restricted to the Community Commercial zoning district. Essential public facilities that are not expressly listed within a zoning district are subject to a conditional use permit. All essential public facilities requiring a conditional use permit shall be subject to the additional requirements below:

(1) The federal, state, regional or local agency (applicant) shall provide a justifiable need for the public facility and for its location within Fircrest.

(2) The applicant shall provide a site selection analysis consisting of at least three proposed sites, one of which must be located outside of the Fircrest city limits. The applicant shall identify the reasons for the proposed site being more desirable than the other two identified sites.

(3) Based on the potential impact to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of Fircrest, the planning commission may require a proposed facility to be located a sufficient distance from any residential district, residential use, park, children’s school or day-care facility to mitigate the impact.

(4) The applicant shall provide a list and description of other similar facilities within Pierce County. At a minimum, each such description shall include the address, contact person, telephone number, size, scope and resident population (if any) of the other similar facilities. The planning commission may consider the fair distribution of similar essential public capital facilities within Pierce County. Fair distribution shall be based on a per capita analysis of Pierce County jurisdictions. If Fircrest is presently exceeding its fair share of such a facility, the planning commission may deny the request if the rationale for selecting Fircrest over another location is not a compelling one. (Ord. 1311 § 31, 2002; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.023 Nonconforming lots, uses and structures.

(a) Application. The provisions of this section shall apply to uses and structures which become nonconforming as a result of the application of this title to them, or from classification or reclassification of a property under this title or any subsequent amendments thereto.

(b) Continuation of Nonconforming Uses and Structures. Any lawful use of land and/or building or structure existing, under construction, or for which a building or use permit has been granted and was still in force at the time this title became effective may be continued, even though the use does not conform to the provisions of the district in which it is located, subject to the following conditions:

(1) Enlargement. No building, structure or land that is nonconforming by reason of use shall be enlarged or expanded; provided, that normal upkeep, repairing and maintenance of nonconforming buildings and structures are permitted outright, provided the activities do not increase the nonconformity of the buildings or structures.

(2) Replacement. Any building or structure nonconforming by reason of use which has been damaged or destroyed by fire, earthquake, flood, wind or other disaster may be restored and the occupancy or use of the building, structure or part thereof which existed at the time of damage or destruction may be continued subject to all provisions of this title, but the restoration of the nonconforming building or structure shall not serve to extend or increase the nonconformance of the original building, structure or use. Any reconstruction authorized by this section shall commence within one year of the damage and shall be substantially completed within 18 months of the date the damage occurred.

(3) Vacation. If any nonconforming use of land and/or building or structure is vacated for a period of one year, nonconforming rights shall automatically terminate and any future use of the land and/or building or structure shall conform to the zoning district in which it is located. Notwithstanding this one-year automatic termination, vacation may also be deemed to be an act or failure to act on the part of the property owner which indicates an intention that the property owner does not claim or retain any interest in the right to the nonconforming use.

(4) Structural Alteration – Enlargement of Nonconforming Building or Structure. A building or structure which is nonconforming only by reason of substandard yard or height may be structurally enlarged, provided the enlargement does not increase the nonconformance, and further provided the enlarged building or structure conforms with bulk regulations relating to lot coverage or impervious surface coverage. 

(5) Structural Alteration – Replacement of Nonconforming Building or Structure. A building or structure which is nonconforming by reason of substandard yard, height, lot coverage, impervious surface coverage, or other bulk regulation may be restored or rebuilt as it originally existed upon the original foundation and perimeter, if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, earthquake, flood, wind or other natural disaster. Enlargement of the building or structure from the original design may occur in accordance with subsection (b)(4) of this section. 

(6) Structural Alteration – Repair of Nonconforming Building or Structure. A building or structure which is nonconforming by reason of substandard yard, height, lot coverage, impervious surface coverage, or other bulk regulation may be repaired or restored to its original or comparable condition and design. Modifications to the original design of the building or structure may occur in accordance with subsection (b)(4) of this section. 

(7) Change of Conforming Use. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not revert to the same or different nonconforming use. 

(8) Change of Ownership. Change of ownership, tenancy or management of a nonconforming use shall not affect its legal, nonconforming status.

(9) Annexation Resulting in Nonconformity. Any lawfully existing use of land or building or structure located in an unincorporated area which, through annexation, becomes nonconforming shall be deemed a legal, nonconforming use, building or structure. (Ord. 1611 § 17, 2018; Ord. 1246 § 15, 2000).


22.58.024 Outdoor storage of vehicles.

22.58.026 Floor area ratio (FAR) standards.

(a) The intent of FAR standards is to ensure the size of detached single family dwellings will be scaled proportionally to the size of the lots on which they are situated so that new infill development will be generally consistent in scale and proportion with previously constructed homes and neighborhoods in the city. FAR standards should be used in conjunction with other bulk requirements and design standards and guidelines to be effective in achieving this intent.

(b) FAR is the ratio of the total floor area of buildings on a site to the size of the land at that location. FAR is the total building square footage divided by the total site area square footage, except as noted below.

(c) Floor area for purposes of calculating FAR and maximum floor area does not include the following:

(1) Attic floor area with less than five feet of ceiling height, as measured between the finished floor and the supporting members for the roof, and attics with structural roof trusses and usable attic space that is completely contained within the roof area (excluding dormers).

(2) Basement floor area with a ceiling height less than four feet above the finished grade, as defined in FMC 22.98.321. Ceiling height will be measured to the top of the structural members of the floor above.

(3) The first 600 square feet of detached accessory building floor area on a lot.

(4) Uncovered and covered decks, porches, and walkways.

(d) Floor area with a ceiling height greater than 16 feet shall be calculated at twice the actual floor area toward allowable FAR.

(e) FAR is calculated using a site’s buildable area, excluding critical areas and their required associated buffers. (Ord. 5162 § 43, 2015).


22.58.027 Cottage housing.

(a) Purpose and Intent. The provisions of this section are available as alternatives to the development of typical detached single-family homes. In the event of a conflict between the standards in this section and other standards in this title, the standards in this section shall control. These standards are intended to address the changing composition of households and the need for smaller, more diverse, and often, more affordable housing choices. Providing for a variety of housing types also encourages innovation and diversity in housing design and site development, while ensuring compatibility with surrounding single-family residential development. These provisions support the growth management goal of more efficient use of urban residential land.

(b) Housing Types Defined. The following definitions apply to the housing types allowed through the provisions in this section:

(1) “Cottage” means a detached, single-family dwelling unit containing 1,500 square feet or less of gross floor area.

(2) “Carriage unit” means a single-family dwelling unit, not to exceed 800 square feet in gross floor area, located above a garage structure in a cottage housing development.

(3)  “Two-/three-unit home” means a structure containing two dwelling units or three dwelling units, not exceeding 1,000 square feet per unit on average, designed to look like a detached single-family home.

(e) Design Standards and Guidelines.

(1) Orientation of Dwelling Units. Dwellings within a cottage housing development should be oriented to promote a sense of community, both within the development and, with respect to the larger community, outside of the cottage project. A cottage housing development should not be designed to “turn its back” on the surrounding neighborhood.

(A) Each dwelling unit shall have a primary entry and/or covered porch oriented to the common open space or pathway connecting to the common open space.

(B) Each dwelling unit abutting a public right-of-way (not including alleys) shall have an inviting facade, such as a primary or secondary entrance or porch, oriented to the public right-of-way. If a dwelling unit abuts more than one public right-of-way, the city shall determine to which right-of-way the inviting facade shall be oriented.

(C) Each dwelling unit abutting a public right-of-way (not including alleys) shall incorporate facade modulation, windows, and roofline variations to avoid blank walls that orient to the public right-of-way.

(2) Required Common Open Space. Common open space shall provide a sense of openness, visual relief, and community for cottage developments. The space must be located outside of critical areas and their buffers, and developed and maintained to provide for passive and/or active recreational activities for the residents of the development.

(A) Each area of common open space shall be in one contiguous and usable piece with a minimum dimension of 20 feet on all sides.

(B) Land located between dwelling units and an abutting right-of-way or access easement may not serve as required common open space, unless the area is reserved as a separate tract, and does not contain pathways leading to individual units or other elements that detract from its appearance and function as a shared space for all residents.

(C) Required common open space may be divided into no more than two separate areas per cottage cluster.

(D) Common open space shall be located in a centrally located area and be easily accessible, physically and visually, to all dwellings within the cottage cluster.

(E) Sight-obscuring privacy fences that discourage interaction between neighbors may not be located within required open space areas. If fences are used to enclose common open space, they shall have at least 50 percent visually permeable elements, such as pickets, cedar split rails, iron work, or trellis treatment, and shall not exceed two feet in height.

(F) Landscaping located in common open space areas shall be designed to allow for easy access and use of the space by all residents, and to facilitate maintenance needs. Existing mature trees should be retained in accordance with FMC 22.62.009.

(G) Unless the shape or topography of the site precludes the ability to locate units adjacent to the common open space, the following standards must be met:

(i) The open space shall be located so that it will be surrounded by cottages or common buildings on at least three sides;

(ii) At least 50 percent of the units in the development shall abut a common open space. A cottage is considered to “abut” an area of open space if there is no structure, road or critical area between the unit and the open space.

(H) Surface water management facilities shall be limited within common open space areas. Low impact development (LID) features are permitted, provided they do not adversely impact access to or use of the common open space for a variety of activities. Conventional stormwater collection and conveyance tools, such as flow control and/or water quality vaults, are permitted if located underground.

(3) Private Open Space.

(A) Each cottage unit shall have a covered porch with a minimum area of 64 square feet per unit and a minimum dimension of eight feet on all sides. Porches shall be associated with primary point of entry.

(B) Each carriage unit shall have a deck or balcony, oriented toward the common open space.

(C) In addition to porches, at least 300 square feet of private, contiguous, usable open space adjacent to each individual dwelling unit shall be provided to contribute positively to the visual appearance of the development, promote diversity in planting materials, and utilize generally accepted good landscape design. The private open space shall be oriented toward the common open space to the extent possible and have no dimension less than 10 feet. The private open space shall define private residences from common areas, trails, and parking areas. If fences are used to enclose private open space, they shall have at least 50 percent visually permeable elements through the use of pickets, cedar split rails, iron work, or trellis treatment, and shall not exceed two feet in height.

(4) Community Buildings. At least one community building is required for each cottage development.

(A) Community buildings shall be at least 500 square feet on the main floor and shall have an architectural character similar to that of the dwelling units.

(B) Building height for community buildings shall not exceed the height standard for cottages.

(C) Outdoor patio space is encouraged to be provided in conjunction with community buildings.

(D) Community buildings must be located on the same site as the cottage housing development, and be commonly owned by the residents.

(5) Shared Detached Garages and Surface Parking Design. Parking areas should be located so their visual presence is minimized and associated noise or other impacts are minimized, both within and outside the development. These areas should also maintain the single-family character along public streets.

(A) Shared detached garage structures may not exceed four single garage doors per building, and a total of 1,200 square feet. Carriage units are preferred above these garage structures.

(B) For shared detached garages, the design of the structure must be similar to and compatible with that of the dwelling units within the development. Garage doors shall be painted to match, or minimize contrast with, the building’s body color in order to minimize their visual impact.

(C) Shared detached garage structures and surface parking areas must be screened from streets and adjacent residential uses by landscaping or architectural screening.

(D) Shared detached garage structures shall be reserved through a covenant for the parking of vehicles owned by the residents of the development. Storage of items which preclude the use of the parking spaces for vehicles is prohibited.

(E) Surface parking areas may not be located in clusters of more than four spaces. Clusters must be separated by a distance of at least 20 feet.

(F) Carports are not permitted.

(6) Low Impact Development. The proposed site design shall incorporate the use of low impact development (LID) strategies to meet stormwater management standards. LID is a set of techniques that mimic natural watershed hydrology by slowing, evaporating/transpiring, and filtering water, which allows water to soak into the ground closer to its source. The design should seek to meet the following objectives:

(A) Preservation of natural hydrology.

(B) Reduced impervious surfaces.

(C) Treatment of stormwater in numerous small, decentralized structures.

(D) Use of natural topography for drainageways and storage areas.

(E) Preservation of portions of the site in undisturbed, natural conditions.

(F) Reduction of the use of piped systems. Whenever possible, site design should use multifunctional open drainage systems such as vegetated swales or filter strips which also help to fulfill landscaping and open space requirements.

(7) Two-/Three-Unit Homes and Carriage Units within Cottage Projects. Two-/three-unit homes and carriage units may be included within a cottage housing development. Design of these units should be compatible with that of the cottages included in the project.

(8) Variation in Unit Sizes, Building and Site Design. Cottage projects shall establish building and site design that promote variety and visual interest.

(A) Projects shall include a variety of unit sizes within a single development.

(B) Proposals shall provide a variety of building styles, features, colors and site design elements within a cottage housing development.

(C) Dwellings with a similar combination of features and treatments may be clustered around a shared common open space. Developments containing two or more clusters of cottages shall use distinctively unique exterior finish materials and architectural design elements for each cottage cluster to avoid repetition.

(9) Pedestrian Flow through Development. Pedestrian connections should link all buildings to the public right-of-way, common open space, parking areas and other cottage clusters in the development.

(10) Storage Space. Storage space may be provided as follows:

(A) Detached sheds designed to be similar in character to the cottage units, using similar building materials and design elements.

(B) Storage space within detached parking structures that does not conflict with parking of vehicles in the garages.

(C) Storage space within a dwelling unit, accessible only through an external door.

(D) Designated storage space attached to a community building that is not counted toward the 500-square-foot minimum area for such buildings.

(E) Other storage space options approved through the administrative site plan review process.

(11) Landscaping. Cottage housing developments shall incorporate a landscape master plan, designed and stamped by a professional landscape architect. The design shall comply with applicable landscape standards and guidelines that address landscape components included in a cottage housing development.

(f) Review Process.

(1) Approval Process. Developments shall be processed under Chapter 22.66 FMC, Administrative Design Review. Public notice for developments proposed through this section shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 22.06 FMC applicable to Type II project permit applications.

(2) Requests for Modifications to Standards. Applicants may request minor modifications to the general parameters and design standards set forth in this section. The director may modify the requirements if all of the following criteria are met:

(A) The site is constrained due to unusual shape, topography, easements or sensitive areas.

(B) The modification is consistent with the objectives of this section.

(C) The modification will not result in a development that is less compatible with neighboring land uses.

(3) Review Criteria. In addition to the criteria established for review of development proposals in FMC 22.66.006, the applicant must demonstrate that:

(A) The proposal is compatible with and is not larger in scale than surrounding development with respect to size of units, building heights, roof forms, setbacks between adjacent buildings and between buildings and perimeter property lines, number of parking spaces, parking location and screening, access and lot coverage.

(B) Any proposed modifications to provisions of this section are important to the success of the proposal as an alternative housing project and are necessary to meet the intent of these regulations.

(g) Additional Standards. The city’s approval of a cottage housing or two-/three-unit home development does not constitute approval of a subdivision, a short plat, or a binding site plan. A lot that has cottage, carriage or two-/three-unit homes may not be subdivided unless all of the requirements of the Fircrest Municipal Code are met. A lot containing a two-/three-unit home may not be subdivided in a manner that results in the dwelling units being located on separate lots. (Ord. 1562 § 44, 2015).


22.58.028 Lot development standards.

Newly created lots shall be of such shape that a circle with a diameter equal to the minimum lot width specified for the zone in which the lot is located can fit within the boundary of the lot, as shown below:

(i) Speculative Use. When the city has received an application for a site plan approval or other permits for a building shell without tenant uses being specified, off-street parking requirements shall be based on the possible tenant improvements or uses authorized by the zone designation and compatible with the limitations of the site plan or other permit. When the range of possible uses results in different parking requirements, the director or hearing examiner, as appropriate, will establish the amount of parking based on a likely range of uses.

(j) Joint Use. In the case of two or more uses in the same building or on the same lot, for example within a commercial mixed use development that includes retail, residential and other uses, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use. However, an applicant may request a parking demand reduction credit per FMC 22.60.004 and/or a shared parking facilities credit per FMC 22.60.005 to reduce the overall parking requirement. The director or hearing examiner, as appropriate, shall be responsible for determining the various uses within a building or on a lot and the resulting parking requirements for each use. (Ord. 1638 § 27, 2019; Ord. 1562 § 46, 2015; Ord. 1506 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1470 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1311 § 32, 2002; Ord. 1246 § 16, 2000).


22.60.004 Parking demand reduction credit.

A property owner may request a reduction from the minimum required off-street parking by substantiating that parking demand will be reduced for the life of the project. This request shall be reviewed in conjunction with a site plan, conditional use permit, or preliminary development plan application. In such cases, the hearing examiner may approve a reduction of up to 50 percent of the minimum required number of spaces if a parking demand study prepared by a professional traffic engineer substantiates that:

(a) Because of the unique nature of the use, the characteristics of the site and surrounding neighborhood, the availability of alternative means of transportation, or other relevant local factors, parking demand can be met with a reduced number of spaces; or

(b) A shared parking facility designed in accordance with FMC 22.60.005 will effectively reduce parking demand to a level below the minimum required parking; or

(c) A combined parking facility for two or more complementary uses which have similar hours of operation will reduce parking demand to a level below the minimum required parking. The hearing examiner may authorize a five percent reduction for two complementary uses, a 10 percent reduction for three uses, and a 15 percent reduction for four or more uses; or

(d) An employee-sponsored commute trip reduction program designed in accordance with state law will effectively reduce parking demand below the minimum required parking. (Ord. 1638 § 28, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 16, 2000).


22.60.005 Shared parking facilities.

A property owner may submit a request for a shared parking facility as part of a site plan, conditional use permit, or preliminary development plan application. In such case, the hearing examiner may reduce the number of required off-street parking spaces when shared parking facilities for two or more uses are proposed, provided:

(a) The total parking area exceeds 5,000 square feet;

(b) The parking facilities are designed and developed as a single on-site common parking facility, or as a system of on-site and off-site facilities, if all parking facilities are connected with improved pedestrian walkways, and no building or use involved is more than 600 feet from the most remote shared facility unless transportation is provided between the parking generator and parking facility;

(c) The amount of the reduction shall not exceed 10 percent for each use, unless:

(1) The normal hours of operation for each use are separated by at least one hour; or

(2) A parking demand study prepared by a professional traffic engineer documents that the hours of actual parking demand for the proposed uses will not conflict and that uses will be served by adequate parking if shared parking reductions are authorized;

(d) The total number of parking spaces in the common parking facility is not less than the minimum required spaces for any single use;

(e) A covenant or other contract for shared parking between the cooperating property owners is approved by the hearing examiner and city attorney. This covenant or other contract must be recorded with the Pierce County auditor as a deed restriction on both properties and cannot be modified or revoked without the consent of the hearing examiner and city attorney; and

(f) If any requirements for shared parking are violated, the affected property owners must provide a remedy satisfactory to the hearing examiner and city attorney or provide the full amount of required off-street parking for each use, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 1638 § 29, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 16, 2000).


22.60.006 Maximum parking space provisions.

For multifamily residential, commercial and industrial uses, the number of off-street parking spaces provided shall not exceed 120 percent of the minimum required number of spaces specified in FMC 22.60.003. A property owner may submit a request as part of a site plan, conditional use permit, or preliminary development plan application to provide parking spaces in excess of the maximum allowable number. The hearing examiner may approve an increase of up to 50 percent of the minimum required number of spaces if:

(a) A parking demand study prepared by a professional traffic engineer supports the need for increased parking and demonstrates that:

(1) Shared and combined parking opportunities in FMC 22.60.005 have been fully explored and will be utilized to the extent practicable;

(2) On-site park and ride facilities have been fully explored and will be provided to the extent practicable;

(3) Commute trip reduction measures will be implemented, if required by state law, to the extent practicable.

(b) The project has been designed to include the following design elements, facilities and programs to the satisfaction of the hearing examiner. In those instances where site constraints impede compliance with the design requirements, written findings of fact shall be made identifying site and project constraints and included in the final notice of decision. In its findings, the hearing examiner shall determine if a good faith effort has been made in building and site design in order to accommodate the following design elements, facilities and programs:

(1) The excess parking spaces shall be located within an enclosed parking structure or constructed of a permeable surface such as interlocking paving blocks (cement or plastic) or other porous pavement which minimizes impervious surface and achieves a superior appearance when compared with a large expanse of asphalt or concrete paving.

(2) Alternative parking lot designs shall be utilized in order to reduce impervious surface, e.g., one-way instead of two-way access aisles.

(3) The amount of required landscaping within the area of additional parking shall be doubled. This additional landscape area may be dispersed throughout the parking lot.

(4) A minimum of 75 percent of the parking spaces shall be located behind the building, and the remainder shall not be located within the minimum and maximum yard setback areas adjoining a street. Parking lots located along flanking streets shall have added landscape and a superior design to strengthen pedestrian qualities, e.g., low walls, street furniture, seating areas, public art, etc.

(5) Preferential parking shall be located near primary building entrances for employees who rideshare and for high occupancy vehicles, if applicable.

(6) The developer shall create a transit/rideshare information center and place it in a conspicuous location on the premises.

(7) For sites located adjacent to or within 600 feet of a Pierce Transit bus or van route, the developer shall fund the purchase and installation of a transit shelter package, including seating, trash receptacle and related facilities for each side of the street which has a transit route, consistent with Pierce Transit operational needs in accordance with FMC 22.60.014. (Ord. 1638 § 30, 2019; Ord. 1562 § 47, 2015; Ord. 1246 § 16, 2000).


22.60.007 Location of off-street spaces.

(a) For single-family and duplex dwellings, the parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the associated dwelling unit.

(b) For multifamily dwellings, the parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as associated dwelling units. The spaces may also be located on a contiguous lot if within 600 feet of the dwelling units and if the lot is legally encumbered by an easement or other appropriate means approved by the director and city attorney to ensure continuous use of the parking facilities.

(c) For nonresidential uses, the parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the associated use. The spaces may also be located on a contiguous or noncontiguous lot if within 600 feet of the associated use and authorized as a shared parking facility in accordance with FMC 22.60.005. (Ord. 1246 § 16, 2000).


22.60.008 Parking and driveway design standards.

(a) Parking Space and Driveway/Aisle Dimensions. The minimum parking space and aisle dimensions for the most common parking angles are shown in the accompanying table.

	* See FMC 22.60.009 for information on the accessible parking space dimensions.

(b) Compact Car Space Requirements. The installation of compact spaces is required so that impervious surface coverage associated with parking facilities is minimized and the appearance of sites is enhanced by increasing the proportion of landscaping relative to pavement. No less than 40 percent and no more than 50 percent of the total number of spaces provided for a multifamily residential or nonresidential development shall be sized to accommodate compact cars. Each space shall be clearly identified as a compact car space by painting the word “COMPACT” in capital letters, a minimum of eight inches high, on the pavement at the base of the parking space and centered between the striping. Aisle widths shall conform to the standards set for standard size cars.

(c) Extra Width Adjoining Landscaped Areas. Parking spaces abutting a landscaped area or raised walkway on the drive or passenger side of the vehicle shall provide an additional 18 inches above the minimum space width requirement. This additional space will provide a place to step other than in the landscaped area or allow for easier ingress and egress next to a vehicle. The additional width shall be separated from the adjacent landscaped area by a parking space division stripe.

(d) Parking Space Depth Reduction.

(1) Where parking spaces abut a walkway, parking space depth may be reduced by up to 18 inches and a portion of the walkway utilized for vehicle overhang; provided, that wheelstops or curbs are installed and the remaining walkway provides a minimum of five feet of unimpeded passageway for pedestrians.

(2) To minimize impervious surface and enhance landscaping, parking space pavement depth may be reduced by up to 18 inches when the pavement at the front end of a space is replaced by a landscaped area containing groundcovers which do not exceed a maximum height of six inches above parking space grade. Wheel stops or curbs shall be installed to protect this area from vehicular damage.

(e) Driveway Widths and Locations. Driveways for single-family detached dwellings shall not exceed 20 feet in width unless the director approves an alternative design which uses a permeable surface such as interlocking paving blocks or other porous pavement which minimizes impervious surface. In no case shall the driveway exceed 20 feet within the public right-of-way or exceed the minimum width necessary to provide reasonable access to the dwelling. No more than one driveway is permitted to provide access to a single-family detached dwelling. Driveways for all other developments may cross required setbacks or landscaped areas in order to provide access between the off-street parking areas and the street; provided, that driveway width does not exceed the minimum necessary to provide safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation. Driveways oriented parallel to a street shall not be located within the minimum and maximum yard setback areas adjoining the street, unless there is no other practicable alternative to provide access to the interior of a site.

(f) Lighting. Lighting shall be provided in accordance with FMC 22.58.018.

(g) Tandem Parking. Tandem or end-to-end parking is allowed in single-family detached residential developments. Duplex and multifamily developments may have tandem parking areas for each dwelling unit but shall not combine parking for separate dwelling units in tandem parking areas.

(h) Parking Surface. All required vehicle parking and storage must be in a garage, carport or on an approved, dust-free, all-weather surface. Use of a permeable surface such as interlocking paving blocks or other porous pavement that minimizes impervious surface is encouraged for spaces which are used infrequently. Any surface used for vehicle parking or storage must have direct and unobstructed driveway access. (Ord. 1638 § 31, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 16, 2000).


22.60.009 Barrier-free parking requirements.

(f) The director may waive all or portions of the additional landscaping requirement for an existing development or use. The applicant shall make a written request for waiver and indicate the reasons for not being able to comply with the requirements of this chapter. A waiver shall only be issued for that portion of the required landscaping which will create a significant spatial hardship based on the physical characteristics of the existing development. (Ord. 1562 § 48, 2015; Ord. 1487 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1283 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.003 Tree policy statement.

(a) The planning commission and city council find that:

(1) Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for human survival.

(2) Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and transpire considerable amounts of water each day, thereby playing a vital role in purifying the air.

(3) Trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing through the ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers.

(4) Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control.

(5) During the past several decades, the percentage of tree canopy cover in the Puget Sound region has declined dramatically as a result of urban growth and other human activities.

(6) Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic, and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the monotony of human developments of the land, particularly streets and parking areas. As such, trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values.

(b) Based on the policy statement in subsection (a) of this section, the planning commission and city council declare that it is not only desirable but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons living or working within the city’s planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and, under the circumstances set forth in this chapter, to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.004 General landscaping requirements.

In addition to the more specific requirements elsewhere in this chapter, the following general requirements shall be met by all developments subject to this chapter:

(a) Undeveloped Areas. Undeveloped areas of a lot which are not required to be landscaped by other requirements of this chapter shall be planted with groundcover to minimize erosion and sedimentation and the release of dust and other particulates. Groundcover may consist of planted or existing vegetation maintained so as not to exceed one foot in height.

(b) Groundcover. Groundcover shall be planted and maintained within all required landscaping areas. For commercial and industrial developments, groundcover shall consist of plantings that will achieve complete coverage within three years. Generally, groundcover in four-inch pots shall be planted on 18-inch triangular centers, and groundcover in one-gallon or greater sized containers shall be planted on 24-inch triangular centers, in order to assure complete coverage. Sizing and spacing may be adjusted to reflect the growth habits of specific groundcovers, provided the planting schedule will achieve full coverage. Groundcover is not required within the dripline of any shrub or evergreen tree and within a two-foot radius of a deciduous tree trunk. Additionally, groundcover may be excluded from the area under shrubs or trees with a spacing of two feet or less. The spacing shall be measured from the dripline of shrubs and evergreen trees and from a two-foot radius from a deciduous tree trunk.

(c) Turf. Turf lawn may be used as groundcover but should be limited to no more than 30 percent of landscaped areas in commercial and industrial developments, and no more than 50 percent in planned residential developments and subdivisions, in order to conserve water and encourage the use of alternative groundcovers which are drought tolerant or which provide wildlife habitat or cover. Generally, in order to maximize the efficiency of irrigation systems, turf should not be used in areas less than five feet in width or depth, or on slopes exceeding a three-to-one ratio (horizontal to vertical).

(d) Soil Amendments. Existing soils should be augmented with a two-inch layer of fully composted organic material rototilled a minimum of six inches deep. Landscape areas shall be covered with at least two inches of mulch to minimize evaporation and reduce maintenance. Mulch shall consist of materials such as yard waste, sawdust and/or manure that is fully composted. Generally, bark mulch, gravel or other similar nonvegetative material should only be used to assist vegetative growth and maintenance within landscaping areas. Nonvegetative material should not be a substitute for, or interfere with, required vegetative groundcover. The director may approve alternative specifications for soil amendments if a licensed landscape architect, Washington certified nurseryman, or Washington certified landscape contractor certifies that based on site-specific conditions, alternative specifications will achieve the same or greater benefit.

(e) Native Plants. New landscaping materials shall include species native to the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest or noninvasive naturalized species that have adapted to the climatic conditions of the region. Generally, at least 25 percent of the area to be landscaped shall be planted with species native to the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest. The mix of native plants shall include trees, shrubs and groundcovers. Because some native plants have limited seasonal availability, the applicant or landscape professional responsible for preparing the landscaping plan required in FMC 22.62.010 should determine availability prior to plan submittal. The applicant or landscape professional responsible for installing the plants shall ensure that the plants specified in the approved plan will be secured for timely planting.

(f) Slopes in Landscaping Area. Generally, slopes within landscaping areas should not exceed a two-to-one ratio (horizontal to vertical) in order to decrease erosion potential, maximize irrigation efficiency, and to facilitate maintenance.

(g) Clear Line of Sight. Landscaping shall be designed, planted and maintained in a manner that ensures pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular safety. Shrubs and groundcover within and adjacent to parking lots and circulation areas shall not exceed 36 inches in height when necessary to provide for a clear line of sight for vehicular drivers. The shrub and groundcover height shall be measured from adjacent parking or circulation pavement surface.

(h) Safety Equipment. Landscaping around fire and safety equipment such as fire hydrants shall be designed, planted and maintained in a manner that ensures adequate access and use. Groundcover around fire and safety equipment shall be of a nonclimbing variety.

(i) Tree Maintenance. Trees shall be cared for in accordance with the American National Standards Institute’s (ANSI) Standard Practices for Trees, Shrubs, and Other Woody Plant Maintenance (ANSI A300) in order to allow them to reach their mature height and form. Tree topping by a public utility to preserve essential services is permitted. However, tree topping unrelated to the preservation of essential services shall not be performed without prior approval of the director. The director may require a written opinion from a professional landscape architect or arborist regarding the necessity of tree topping prior to granting approval.

(j) Tree Thinning. The number of trees planted in accordance with a city-approved landscaping plan may be reduced by thinning in order to enhance the health of the existing trees. The thinning shall not reduce the overall intent of the required landscaping. Tree thinning of required landscaping shall not be allowed without prior approval of the director and shall be in accordance with the ANSI A300 standards. The director may require written opinion from a professional landscape architect or arborist regarding the necessity of tree thinning prior to granting approval.

(k) Calculations/Measurements. All calculations and measurements within this chapter shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with greater than or equal to one-half being rounded up. Caliper size for new trees shall be measured at six inches above soil level. Mature trees shall be measured at four feet six inches above ground (DBH).

(l) Single-Family Infill Lots – Applicability and Intent. The intent is to ensure that newly developed single-family infill lots are landscaped so that yards visible from the abutting street(s) will have a finished appearance and will not have the appearance of a construction site after the building has been completed and finalized by the city. At a minimum, a finished appearance shall consist of turf with foundation plantings and/or perimeter plantings. (Ord. 1562 § 49, 2015; Ord. 1487 § 2, 2009; Ord. 1283 § 2, 2001; Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.005 Public right-of-way landscaping requirements.

All public rights-of-way adjacent to a lot shall be landscaped in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. It shall be the responsibility of the adjoining property owner to install and maintain the right-of-way landscaping to city standards. Street trees shall be installed in accordance with FMC 22.62.006. Walls and fences shall not be incorporated into the right-of-way landscaping unless a right-of-way encroachment permit is approved by the public works department in accordance with FMC 22.58.004(h). The portion of a right-of-way that is not devoted to street, driveway or sidewalk pavement shall not be covered with impervious material or used for vehicle parking or storage in order to protect the street tree root zone. At the request of the city, the adjoining property owner may be required to remove right-of-way landscaping based on transportation, safety or utility requirements. Failure on the part of adjoining property owner to respond to a removal request may cause the city to remove the landscaping and assess the adjoining property owner the costs of the removal. (Ord. 1512 § 5, 2011; Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.006 Street trees.

Trees shall be planted along both sides of all newly created, widened, or substantially improved public and private streets, and along public and private street frontages located within or adjacent to a commercial, industrial, institutional, public, quasi-public, or duplex or multifamily residential development, constructed after the effective date of this chapter, in accordance with the following standards:

(a) Spacing of street trees, on average, shall be 30 feet on center. For trees which have an exceptionally broad canopy form, the director may allow spacing greater than 30 feet on center. For trees which have a narrow canopy form, the director may require spacing of less than 30 feet on center. Generally, trees should be planted at least 10 feet from utility or light poles or fire hydrants, 20 feet from street corners, and 10 feet from driveways. The director may authorize irregular spacing to accommodate sight distance requirements for driveways or intersections or to avoid public infrastructure such as street lighting, utility poles or fire hydrants. 

(b) Street trees shall be deciduous and have a caliper of at least one and three-quarters inches at the time of planting. The caliper of the street trees within a development may be averaged to meet the one and three-quarter-inch standard; provided, that no individual tree shall have a caliper of less than one and one-half inches. 

(c) Street trees shall be high-branching with a canopy that starts at least six feet above finished grade, and have roots which will not break up sidewalks or roadbeds or invade utility lines. For areas without overhead power lines, tree types shall be planted which will achieve a minimum height of 30 feet at maturity. 

(d) Street tree types shall be selected in accordance with the suggested plant list contained in Chapter 22.64 FMC. Tree types and locations shall take into consideration lighting requirements for streets, parking, and pedestrian circulation areas, and signage requirements. The tree type shall not bear fruit or release sticky substances. 

(e) Where feasible, street trees shall be planted in the planter strip between the curb and sidewalk. If the sidewalk is located abutting the curb, street trees shall be planted within tree wells installed in the sidewalk and covered by grates; provided, that a minimum unobstructed sidewalk width of five feet is maintained and irrigation is provided to each tree. If insufficient space exists to maintain an unobstructed sidewalk width of five feet, or the planter strip is less than five feet in width, the street trees shall be planted behind the sidewalk at a distance not greater than 10 feet from the sidewalk. The director may require root deflectors or impose other planting specifications, if recommended by a professional landscape architect or arborist.

(f) Street trees shall be maintained by the adjacent property owner unless they are maintained by a homeowners’ association, condominium owners’ association, or similar association, or are part of a city maintenance program.

(g) Pruning of street trees shall be performed per the ANSI A300 standards so as to maintain the natural form of the tree, encourage vigorous growth to a mature spread and height, and avoid weakening the tree to create a hazard. Street trees shall not be topped, pollarded, or otherwise pruned in a manner contrary to these goals, unless there is no practicable alternative that would preserve essential utility services. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.007 Impervious surface landscaping requirements.

The intent of this section is to break up and reduce the barren appearance of parking, circulation, loading, storage and other large impervious surface areas of a site. To the greatest extent practicable, landscaped areas shall be dispersed throughout the impervious surface area. 

(a) Row Requirement. The maximum number of consecutive vehicle parking or sales display spaces without an intervening island or peninsula is 10, unless the row fronts on a landscaping area with a minimum planting width of eight feet. For such rows, the maximum consecutive parking spaces without an intervening island or peninsula is 20 spaces. A landscaping island or peninsula is required at the end of each row of four or more automobile parking spaces which terminates within a parking or circulation area.

(b) Island/Peninsula Requirement. Landscape islands and peninsulas shall have a minimum planting width and length of eight feet and minimum planting area of 120 square feet. There shall be at least one tree planted on every island and peninsula. 

(c) Planting Type and Density. The following landscaping is the minimum required for each 300 square feet of impervious surface landscaping: one two-inch caliper deciduous tree or one six-foot tall evergreen tree; five five-gallon shrubs; and groundcover. There shall be a minimum of one deciduous canopy tree per four parking spaces or vehicle storage or sales display spaces. Deciduous canopy trees shall be selected, installed and maintained in accordance with the street tree standards provided in FMC 22.62.006.

(d) Curb/Curb Edge. Planting areas shall be fully protected by curbs as a means of preventing injury to plants from pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to prevent landscaping material from entering the storm drainage system. No trees or shrubs shall be planted within two feet of a curb edge. Groundcover is required within this two-foot area. (Ord. 1311 § 33, 2002; Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.008 Buffers.

Buffers are intended to lessen the impacts between uses which are incompatible or somewhat incompatible. Buffers are also intended to provide a transition between zoning districts. The level of buffering required for a project shall be determined during the project permit review process. For certain projects, a very dense sight barrier or screen may be required. For other projects, a buffer which provides a visual separation of uses, rather than a full screen, may be deemed adequate. Any combination of trees, shrubs, fences, walls, earthen berms, and related plant materials or design features may be selected provided that the buffer design effectively mitigates the identified impact and is consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.009 Retention and protection of significant trees.

(a) Definition. Significant trees are healthy evergreen trees with a minimum 12-inch DBH and healthy deciduous trees with a minimum nine-inch DBH.

(b) Retention/Maintenance/Removal of Significant Trees. Significant trees which are located on vacant or underutilized property shall be retained on-site, properly maintained and, if necessary, removed, subject to the provisions of this chapter. For new development, site improvements shall be designed and constructed to retain existing significant trees to the extent practicable. The removal of damaged, diseased, hazardous or dead trees is exempt from the requirements of this section unless the trees are providing a wildlife benefit within a regulated critical area, critical area buffer, or other environmentally sensitive area or designated open space.

(1) Retention Standards.

(A) A minimum of 35 percent of significant trees on a site shall be retained. Alternatively, 35 percent of the total combined DBH of significant trees may be retained to meet the retention standard. For sites one acre or larger, 35 percent of the total tree canopy area on a site may be retained in lieu of retaining trees based on percentage of trees or combined DBH. Trees located within a critical area or its buffer are exempt from these provisions, as their retention is generally required pursuant to critical area regulations.

(B) For areas of a site with slopes ≥ 15 percent, the minimum retention percentage required in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section is increased to 50 percent. The retention percentage for the entire site, however, remains 35 percent. The intent is to encourage relatively greater tree retention on steeper slopes and provide greater design flexibility for areas not encumbered by steeper slopes.

(2) Exemptions.

(A) For a new single-family dwelling on an existing lot of record, the removal of significant trees located within the proposed building and driveway footprints, and within 10 feet of these footprints, is exempt from the requirements of this section.

(B) The removal of damaged, diseased, hazardous or dead trees is exempt from the requirements of this section unless the trees are providing a wildlife benefit within a regulated critical area, critical area buffer, or other environmentally sensitive area or designated open space.

(c) Tree Retention Plans. On timbered property greater in size than one-half acre or other sites the city deems it necessary because of special circumstances or complexity, the city shall review the site and be involved in the following three phases of tree retention. The city may retain a consulting arborist to work on the city’s behalf. The cost of this work shall be reimbursed by the applicant prior to the issuance of any building permits or final approval, whichever is first required following the work done by the consulting arborist.

(1) Survey and Evaluation Phase.

(A) Individual Tree Survey. The applicant shall provide a survey of the locations of all trees and place them on the site plan. All trees located near future buildings, roads, common open space areas, and other activity areas shall be evaluated. The tree identification number, species, size, condition, vigor, structure, risk of failure, and maintenance recommendations shall be documented in the plan.

(B) Statistical Sampling. For large stands of trees proposed to be retained in their entirety or largely in their entirety, statistical sampling may be used to estimate the total tree DBH and total number of trees present. Sampling must be carried out by a professional forester based on standard methodologies. Statistical sampling may be used in these stands in lieu of individual tree survey.

(C) Tree Canopy. When calculating the amount of tree canopy on the site, the total canopy area must be based on the most recent aerial photograph available. The aerial photograph must be no more than five years old. Other data such as LiDAR may be used to help in calculating tree canopy as appropriate.

(2) Planning and Design Phase.

(A) Project Design. Project design shall take into account the tree survey and evaluation so as to minimize removal of significant trees providing the greatest ecological and aesthetic benefits. The applicant shall work with the city to help determine which trees can be preserved based on location, grade changes, and proposed uses and improvements.

(B) The critical root zone (CRZ) of all trees to be retained near clearing, grading, or other disturbances shall be shown on all site plan construction documents. Any grading, construction, or utility installation within the CRZ shall be called out on the plan. For development subject to the landscaping requirements of this chapter, no impervious surface shall be installed within the CRZ of a tree to be retained unless a professional landscape architect or arborist determines that the long-term health of the tree will not be significantly harmed. Required work within a CRZ shall be under the direction of the city or a city-approved arborist.

(C) The locations of tree protection barriers shall be shown on the clearing and grading plans. Tree protection barriers shall be shown along the edge of the CRZ or adjusted under the direction of the city or a city-approved arborist.

(3) Construction Phase.

(A) A preconstruction meeting is required before any clearing takes place. The city or a city-approved arborist may point out retained trees to the general contractor, review tree preservation guidelines, and answer questions regarding tree protection.

(B) The city or a city-approved arborist shall inspect and approve tree protection barriers prior to any work on the site, make adjustments where necessary, and discuss techniques to work within CRZs as needed.

(C) The city or a city-approved arborist shall establish a schedule to periodically monitor the tree retention plan based on the number of trees and difficulty of protecting trees during construction.

(D) When clearing and grading activities are completed, the applicant shall request an inspection. The city may require tree maintenance and remedial action to improve tree health and vigor.

(d) Landscaping Credit for Significant Tree Retention. Development subject to the landscaping requirements of this chapter may be given landscaping credit for retaining significant trees on site. The level of credit shall be determined by the director on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the level of screening or buffering, or the extent of canopy coverage, provided by the trees to be retained.

(e) Tree Replacement. When the required number of significant trees cannot be retained as determined at the sole discretion of the city, each significant tree removed shall be replaced with trees of a type similar to the tree being removed, unless the applicant requests an alternative type of tree (e.g., deciduous instead of evergreen) and the director determines that the alternative tree will provide a comparable or greater benefit to the community. The replacement ratio for the removal of significant trees which are not exempt from this chapter shall be as follows:

	MINIMUM TREE REPLACEMENT RATIO 

	Significant Tree	Replacement Plantings

	Evergreen tree: 12 – 24 inches DBH	One 10-foot tall tree or two trees between six and 10 feet tall

	Evergreen tree: > 24 inches DBH	Two 10-foot tall trees or four trees between six and 10 feet tall

	Deciduous tree: nine to 15 inches DBH	Two two-inch caliper trees, minimum eight feet tall 

	Deciduous tree: > 15 inches DBH	Four two-inch caliper trees, minimum eight feet tall

Required street trees shall not count as replacement plantings. If the tree replacement requirement results in an excess of the minimum number of trees required elsewhere in this chapter, the additional trees may be placed off-site upon the approval of the director. The director may accept the additional trees or payment in lieu of the additional trees for tree plantings on public property based on the cost of the tree(s) and installation costs established by a professional landscape architect or landscaping contractor. Upon acceptance, the director shall attempt to locate the trees on a public site which is as close to the donor property as practicable. (Ord. 1562 § 50, 2015; Ord. 1283 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.010 Landscaping plan requirements.

(a) Landscaping plans shall be submitted for any landscaping activity required by FMC 22.62.002. The landscaping plan shall be drawn to scale and include the following information:

(1) The location of all property lines and easements for ingress/egress, utilities, and drainage. 

(2) The location of all existing and proposed structures. The square footage and location for each existing and proposed structure shall be identified. 

(3) The location and design of all pedestrian, storage, garbage, recycling, employee recreation and above-ground stormwater detention and treatment areas.

(4) The location of all impervious surface areas, including structures, parking, loading and circulation areas. The total square footage of all impervious surface areas in square feet shall be identified.

(5) The size and location of all proposed and existing outdoor fixtures and equipment such as utility vaults (structures), fire hydrants, light fixtures, fences, retaining walls, ornamental fountains, pools, benches and garbage/recycling containers or enclosures. 

(6) The location of any off-site structures, landscaping, and other improvements which will have an effect on the location and type of landscaping proposed. 

(7) All existing and proposed landscaping areas showing plant materials to be retained, plant materials to be removed and proposed plants to be installed. The existing and proposed plants shall be clearly labeled as to botanical name, common name, size, location and spacing. The plant schedule shall identify which plants are native to the region. The plan shall indicate any special planting instructions for each plant type. 

(8) A statement that plant identification tags shall be left on, or next to, the plants installed at the site until all required inspections have been completed.

(b) Professional Design Criteria. Landscape plans for all projects requiring administrative design review shall be prepared and approved by either a professional landscape architect, or a licensed, bonded and insured landscaping contractor. When required landscaping is minimal in area, the professional design requirement may be waived by the director if the project proponent is able to demonstrate to the director a clear understanding of the landscaping plan requirements and the ability to prepare an accurate, readable plan which contains the information required in subsection (a) of this section. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.011 Irrigation requirements for new commercial, residential, institutional, public and quasi-public developments.

(a) Temporary irrigation systems shall be installed for all landscape areas except for areas of undisturbed existing vegetation or low areas with existing high soil moisture conditions. Such systems shall be removed after 24 months or two growing seasons, whichever occurs first; provided, that the plantings are established. 

(b) Areas of undisturbed existing vegetation or areas where existing site conditions ensure adequate soil moisture for growth within the required landscape area shall have temporary irrigation systems only as required to sustain new plantings and shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the director. 

(c) Areas of undisturbed existing vegetation, low areas with existing high soil moisture conditions, or landscape areas consisting of drought-tolerant vegetation shall not have permanent irrigation systems. Permanent irrigation systems may be permitted within all other required landscape areas. 

(d) Irrigation plans shall be submitted for all permanent irrigation systems to ensure that plantings will be watered at a sufficient level for plant survival and healthy growth. Permanent irrigation systems shall be designed by a professional landscape architect, certified irrigation designer, or other professional having comparable qualifications. A permanent system shall include:

(1) Moisture or precipitation sensors;

(2) Automatic timers set for operation during periods of minimum evaporation and that ensure adequate moisture levels;

(3) Head-to-head spacing, if sprinkler heads are proposed;

(4) Pressure regulating devices;

(5) Backflow prevention devices; and

(6) Separate irrigation zones for (A) turf and planting beds, and (B) drought-tolerant and nondrought-tolerant species. (Ord. 1487 § 3, 2009; Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.012 Landscape installation.

(a) Timing of Completion. The landscaping required by this chapter shall be installed prior to receiving a final permit inspection sign-off or certificate of occupancy for the project or project phase. The time limit for compliance may be extended by up to six months from the date of the final permit inspection sign-off or certificate of occupancy to allow for installation of landscaping during the next appropriate planting season, subject to submittal of a performance guarantee in accordance with FMC 22.62.013. 

(b) Compliance with Approved Plan. The landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the approved plan. Landscaping installed in accordance with a plan prepared by a professional landscape architect or landscaping contractor shall be inspected by that individual prior to final inspection by the director. The landscape architect or landscaping contractor shall submit a letter to the city indicating that the installation is in accordance with the approved plan. 

(c) Modifications to Approved Plan. Prior to making any deviations in the field from an approved plan, the landscape installer shall obtain approval from the director for the proposed modifications. The director may require the installer to provide a revised plan prior to approving the modifications. If modifications are proposed to a plan prepared by a landscape architect or landscaping contractor, the modifications shall be approved by the landscape architect or landscaping contractor prior to director approval of the changes. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.013 Performance guarantee.

(a) If the installation of landscaping is deferred per FMC 22.62.012(a), a guarantee shall be submitted to the city in order to ensure the completion of the required landscaping. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant and the property owner to contact the director upon completion of the landscaping work and request an inspection.

(b) The type of guarantee shall be approved by the director and city attorney and posted with the department prior to the issuance of the final permit inspection sign-off or certificate of occupancy.   Acceptable guarantees may include: cash bonds; assignment of funds; insurance company performance bonds; and a contractual agreement or bond between the owner/developer and a licensed landscape architect, Washington certified nurseryman, or Washington certified landscape contractor, along with a rider or endorsement specifically identifying the city as a party to the agreement for purposes of enforcement.

(c) The guarantee amount shall be 150 percent of a landscaping bid amount submitted to, and approved by, the director. The bid amount must include labor and materials.

(d) Failure to complete all required landscaping within six months of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall constitute a violation and the city shall use the guarantee to complete the required landscaping and to reimburse the city for documented administrative costs associated with action on the guarantee. If costs incurred by the city exceed the amount provided by the guarantee, the property owner shall reimburse the city in full, or the city may file a lien against the subject property for the amount of any deficit.

(e) If a performance guarantee is required under subsection (a) of this section, the property owner shall provide the city with an irrevocable notarized agreement granting the city and its agents the right to enter the property and perform any necessary work.

(f) Upon completion of the required landscaping by the property owner, at or prior to the expiration of the guarantee, the city shall promptly release the guarantee. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.014 Landscape maintenance. 

(a) Whenever landscaping is or has been required by this chapter or previous city regulations, the landscaping shall be maintained for the life of the project in conformance with the approved plan. Such maintenance shall include the landscaping required within a public right-of-way.

The property owner or other responsible entity shall replace any unhealthy or dead plant materials in conformance with the approved landscape plan unless substitute plant material has been authorized by the director. Replacement shall occur within four months of the loss of the plant or during the next planting season if the loss does not occur in a planting season.

(b) The director may require a landscape maintenance guarantee for specified period of time to ensure initial establishment and/or long-term maintenance of the required landscaping. The value of the guarantee must equal at least 20 percent of the replacement cost of the landscape materials, and shall be used by the city to perform any necessary maintenance and to reimburse the city for documented administrative costs associated with action on the guarantee.

(c) The city may accept, as an alternative to a landscape maintenance guarantee, a contractual agreement or bond between the owner/developer and a licensed landscape architect, Washington certified nurseryman, or Washington certified landscape contractor, along with a rider or endorsement specifically identifying the city as a party to the agreement for purposes of enforcement.

(d) If a landscape maintenance guarantee or similar device is required under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the property owner shall provide the city with an irrevocable notarized agreement granting the city and its agents the right to enter the property and perform any necessary work.

(e) Upon completion of the maintenance period, and if maintenance is not required, the city shall promptly release the landscape maintenance guarantee or similar device. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).


22.62.015 Substitution of plant materials. 

Adjustments to an approved landscape are permitted over time when done in a manner which continues to accomplish the purpose for which the landscape was initially required. For example, if specific plant types fail to thrive at a given location due to soil, moisture, or other site conditions, substitute plant types may be installed if they provide a comparable level of screening, wildlife habitat or cover, drought-tolerance, or other quality originally required. (Ord. 1246 § 17, 2000).

22.64.001 Purpose.

(a) A city’s character is determined by the collective images created by its architecture, streets, parks, shops, open spaces, public art, and buildings. These features reflect the concerns of the citizenry and the image the citizens have of their community. Whether planned or happenstance, the results are a reflection of, and in turn, reflect upon the image the citizens present to themselves and to outsiders.

(b) Good designs are not expensive. The final results are not more costly to build than poorly conceived, badly designed developments, and in fact, may cost less to build and operate. An appropriately scaled building with enhancing facades, signage, color, and ornamentation can provide the same interior square footage as an ill-conceived rectangular box – and may even be more functional and efficient.

(c) Good designs result from a process that includes forethought, planning, standards, examples, critical reviews, and consequence. The purpose of this chapter is to define and illustrate those features that the community finds to be worthy of emulation when the design of new projects is undertaken. 

(d) These guidelines seek to suggest possible design concepts and approaches that realize the desired state. The guidelines use the verbs “should” and “may” rather than “shall” and “must,” recognizing that the objective is the ends, not the means. The guidelines seek to achieve a community design aesthetic within a process that allows individual expression and flexibility to meet changing circumstances while enhancing the ambiance of the city.

(e) These guidelines do not alter the land uses or densities allowed in the underlying zoning districts defined in the preceding sections of this code. Rather, these guidelines seek to define and illustrate how new developments can respond to the character of the surroundings.

(f) While the standards defined in this chapter are guidelines and not regulations, a project developer will demonstrate how each relevant guideline has been accounted for. A project developer may propose alternative solutions, but each relevant criterion will be addressed. (Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001; Ord. 1246 § 18, 2000).


22.64.002 Natural features.

Intent – Retain natural features and landmarks as open space amenities.

(a) Developments should be clustered on capable and useable soils with the least visual or natural value.

(b) Natural features like knolls, hills, ponds, and streams should be retained as open space.

(c) Natural landmarks, like significant trees, and manmade landmarks, should be preserved and made the focus of new developments where possible.

(Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001).


22.64.003 Grading and storm drainage. 

Intent – Retain the natural landscape and avoid creating unnatural or unsightly grading, drainage, and other site disturbances.

(a) Structures, roadways, and other site improvements should be designed to blend with the natural topography with the minimum amount of site disturbance and grade changes. Large cuts and fills that require tall or long retaining walls or rockeries are not appropriate.

(b) Major drainage corridors and detention facilities should be graded and landscaped to blend with the natural landscape in accordance with the provisions of the city stormwater drainage standards and policies. Where possible, stormwater facilities should be incorporated into the site’s design as aesthetic amenities, enhanced portions of walkway or trail corridors, and/or special visual accents. (Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001).


22.64.004 Landforms and viewscapes.

Intent – Fit building improvements into the natural landscape and preserve views of surrounding features.

(a) Buildings should be fit into the existing topography to appear to be an integral part of the natural landform. On sloping sites, buildings should be stepped into the slope to reflect the sloping grade.

(b) Buildings should be placed to preserve and frame views of natural features including shoreline and mountain ranges, and significant townscapes including architectural landmarks from other properties within the surrounding viewscape. (Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001).

Intent – Create an efficient, expandable, safe, and predictable system of minor and major streets.

(a) The street within and adjacent to a site plan or subdivision shall be designed to comply with the street and sidewalk standards in Chapter 22.22 FMC according to the roadway system functional classification in the comprehensive plan. Major streets shall refer to designated arterial and collector streets and minor streets shall refer to local streets and cul-de-sacs.

(b) Proposed streets and sidewalks should extend to the boundary lines of the proposed site plan or subdivision in order to provide for the future development of adjacent tracts unless prevented by natural or manmade conditions or unless such extension is determined to be unnecessary or undesirable by the hearing examiner.

(c) The street pattern for commercial and industrial site plans and subdivisions should be designed to expedite traffic movement, reduce conflicts between various types of land uses and pedestrians, and coordinate the location of proposed buildings with vehicular loading and parking facilities. Commercial and industrial site plans shall provide integral access through or between the property and adjacent properties and surrounding residential neighborhoods.

(d) Generally, street patterns should be based on a grid or interconnected network of streets rather than long irregular loops with dead-ends and cul-de-sacs. Grid street networks should provide regular and frequent intersections typically at 400-foot intervals. Grid layouts may be distorted to account for existing topography, natural features, landscape, and building improvements – and for visual interest.

(e) Within residential neighborhoods, street improvements should be designed to minimize the amount of land and paving necessary while maintaining safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation. Roadway improvements should provide bicycle routes, landscaped edges, and walkways appropriate to the amount of traffic and parking to be provided within each residential neighborhood.

(d) Parking lots should be screened from adjacent land uses by grade differences, walls, fences, trellises, earth berms, and/or planting materials to reduce the visible extent of paved surfaces and buffer noise. Screening improvements should be high enough to block views of and from the parking areas into the first floor of adjacent residential units.

(e) Parking areas should be lighted with pedestrian-scale, non-glare, hooded fixtures that do not intrude onto adjacent properties.

(f) Parking structures should be integrated into surrounding buildings or streetscapes using facades, artworks, landscaping, or other means that visually filter the view of parked cars from pedestrian walkways and trails, adjacent building occupants, and the commercial roadway.

(g) Commercial streets will be reserved for short term; customer-oriented parking spaces, particularly during off-peak traffic hours and prime retail hours and events. Where possible and practical, loading activities should be accomplished from a side street or back property location to reserve through access streets for customer parking use.

22.64.035 Roadway corridors and street frontages.

Intent – Create landscaped setbacks and edges that functionally and visually defines the pedestrian or motor vehicle orientation of the roadway and adjacent land uses. 

(a) Commercial street corridors are the public rights-of-way and the setbacks required within and around roadways and parking lots in nonresidential zones. 

(1) The setback from the street edge will be landscaped to provide “see-through vegetation” that functions as a partial visual separator to soften the appearance of parking areas and building elevations. 

(2) These zones shall be planted with an overhead tree canopy suitable for a mixed motor vehicle and pedestrian environment.

(b) Residential street corridors are the public rights-of-way and the setbacks required within and around collector and arterial roadways and parking lots in all residential zones.

(c) Parkway road corridors are the public rights-of-way and the setbacks required along major roadway entries into the community. 

(1) These parkway road corridors will be landscaped to provide a “filtered to view blocking vegetation” using natural materials that provide continuity with adjacent landscapes. 

(2) Parkway road corridors shall be planted with an overhead tree canopy suitable for a motor vehicle and bicycle environment. (Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001).


22.64.036 Urban buffers.

Intent – Create landscape improvements around parking lots and properties that functionally and visually buffers activities, buildings, and land uses from each other.

(a) Urban parking lots are commonly shared by residential developments, and all parking areas and lots provided for employees, customers, and other public users within the nonresidential zones. Urban parking areas will be landscaped to provide shade and visual relief while maintaining clear sight lines within parking and access areas. 

(1) Shrubs will not exceed a height of three feet around parking lot entries, access aisles, and other vehicle-maneuvering areas in order not to visually block views among vehicles and pedestrians.

(2) The selected plant materials and landscape designs may mix evergreen and deciduous trees to create a continuous canopy.

(3) Plantings may be contained in planting islands or strips having an area of at least 120 square feet with a narrow dimension of not less than eight feet that is unobstructed by vehicle overhang (see FMC 22.62.007(b)).

Intent – Create screens around and over refuse, storage, loading docks, mechanical and utility equipment, and other areas that are functional, effective, safe, and visually pleasing to passersby and adjacent land uses.

(a) Landscape, fence or other opaque improvements should be erected to visually screen refuse, storage, loading docks, and other areas that are not to be accessible or viewed from public walkways, corridors, and roadways. 

(b) Areas that are visible from the upper stories of adjacent structures should have an opaque or semi-opaque horizontal cover or screen to mitigate unsightly views that is compatible with the site’s architecture. 

(c) Latches and other devices should be used to secure refuse and storage areas from animals and children.

(d) Mailboxes, utility meters, lighting, and other service elements should be incorporated into the overall site and landscape screening design of the project. (Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001).


22.64.040 Landscape materials.

Intent – Install landscape materials that are native, drought resistant, and appropriate to the purpose of the improvement.

(a) New landscaping materials shall include native or non-invasive naturalized species that have adapted to the climatic conditions of the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest.

(b) New landscape materials shall consist of drought-tolerant species, except where site conditions within the required landscape areas assure adequate moisture for growth.

(c) Within the landscape buffer areas about the property, particularly along secondary access roads and around parking lots that do not abut the public pedestrian walkway or trail corridors – site plantings should be grouped to simulate natural stands and should not be planted symmetrically or of even spacing unless a symmetrical or even spacing pattern has already been established in the vicinity. 

(d) Buffer areas should retain existing significant trees and vegetation to maintain continuity with original and adjacent natural areas.

(e) Within higher density residential developments, buffer or open spaces may be grouped into common open space areas that define building placements, provide visual accents, preserve landscape or landform features, or house common activity areas – such as playgrounds, swimming pools, or parking areas.

(f) Plant materials and designs, especially street trees, should match or complement the materials or patterns that have already been established along the street or in the neighborhood in color, ultimate size, historical design, and other physical characteristics. (Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001).


22.64.041 Signage. 

Repealed by Ord. 1598. (Ord. 1322 § 4, 2003; Ord. 1272 § 8, 2001).


22.64.042 Large retail establishments.

(a) Facades and Exterior Walls.

Intent – Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual interest that will be consistent with the community’s identity, character, and scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale that Fircrest residents will be able to identify with their community.

(1) Facades greater than 80 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least four percent of the length of the facade, but not less than six feet, and extending at least 20 percent of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 80 horizontal feet. See illustration in FMC 22.64.009.



(2) Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along no less than 60 percent of their horizontal length.

(b) Smaller Retail Stores.

Intent – The presence of smaller retail stores gives a center a “friendlier” appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and expanding the range of the site’s activities. Windows and window displays of such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior facades. The guidelines presented in this subsection are directed toward those situations where principal buildings contain additional, separately owned stores, which occupy less than 25,000 square feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances.

(1) The street level facade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than 60 percent of the horizontal length of the building facade of such additional stores.

(2) Windows shall be recessed and should include visually prominent sills, shutters, or other such forms of framing.

(c) Detail Features.

Intent – Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce massive aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. The elements in the following guideline should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint.

Building facades must include a repeating pattern that shall include no less than three of the elements listed below. At least one of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically.

(1) Color change.

(2) Texture change.

(3) Material module change.

(4) Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib.


[IMAGE]


Expression of Architectural or Structural Bay

(d) Roofs.

Intent – Variations in rooflines should be used to add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roof features should compliment the character of adjoining neighborhoods.

Roofs shall have no less than two of the following features:

(1) Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment such as HVAC units from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not exceed 15 percent of the height of the supporting wall and such parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third of the height of the supporting wall. Such parapets shall feature three dimensional cornice treatments.


[IMAGE]


Parapet Standards

(2) Overhanging eaves, extending no less than three feet past the supporting walls.

(3) Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the supporting walls, with an average slope greater than or equal to one foot of vertical rise for every three feet of horizontal run, and less than or equal to one foot of vertical rise for every one foot of horizontal run. 

(4) Three or more roof slope planes.

(e) Entryways.

Intent – Entryway design elements and variations should give orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The guidelines identify desirable entryway design features. Such principal building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less than three of the following:

(1) Canopies or porticos;

(2) Overhangs;

(3) Recesses/projections;

(4) Arcades;

(5) Raised corniced parapets over the door;

(6) Peaked roof forms;

(7) Arches;

(8) Outdoor patios;

(9) Display windows;

(10) Architectural details such as tile work and moldings, which are integrated into the building structure and design;

(11) Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting.

Where additional stores will be located in the principal building, each such store shall have at least one exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above requirements.

(f) Orientation of Entrances.

Intent – Large retail buildings should feature multiple entrances. Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores, or identified departments in a store. Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often characterize building facades that face bordering land uses.

All sides of a principal building that face an abutting public street shall feature at least one customer entrance. Where a principal building faces more than two abutting public streets, this requirement shall apply only to two sides of the building, including the side of the building facing the primary street, and another side of the building facing a second street.

(g) Outdoor Storage, Trash Collection, and Loading Areas.

Intent – Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. These areas, when visible from adjoining properties and/or public streets, should be screened, recessed or enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts, the selection of inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the problem. Appropriate locations for loading and outdoor storage areas include areas between buildings, where more than one building is located on a site and such buildings are not more than 40 feet apart, or on those sides of buildings that do not have customer entrances.

(1) Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or compaction, loading, or other such uses shall not be visible from abutting streets.

(2) No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or compaction, loading, or other such uses shall be located within 20 feet of any public street, public sidewalk, or internal pedestrian way.

(3) Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, utility meters, HVAC equipment, trash collection, trash compaction, and other service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets, and no attention is attracted to the functions by the use of screening materials that are different from or inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape.

(4) Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences. Materials, colors, and designs of screening walls and/or fences and the cover shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors of the building. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the buildings.

(h) Pedestrian Flows.

Intent – Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This subsection sets forth guidelines for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation systems that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian safety, shelter, and convenience within the center grounds.

(1) Sidewalks at least eight feet in width shall be provided along all sides of the lot that abut a public street.

(2) Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than eight feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry points, and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees, shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers, or other such materials for no less than 50 percent of their length.

(3) Sidewalks, no less than nine feet in width, shall be provided along the full length of the building along any facade featuring a customer entrance, and along any facade abutting public parking areas. Such sidewalks shall be located at least six feet from the facade of the building to provide planting beds for foundation landscaping, except where features such as arcades or entryways are part of the facade.

(4) Internal pedestrian walkways, provided in conformance with subsection (h)(2) of this section, shall provide weather protection features such as awnings or arcades within 30 feet of all customer entrances.

(5) All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways.

(i) Central Features and Community Spaces.

Intent – Buildings should offer attractive and inviting pedestrian scale features, spaces and amenities. Entrances and parking lots should be configured to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be considered as integral parts of the configuration. Pedestrian ways should be anchored by special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, pedestrian light fixtures, bollards, planter walls, and other architectural elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces. Examples of outdoor spaces include plazas, patios, courtyards, and window shopping areas. The features and spaces should enhance the building and the center as integral parts of the community fabric.

Each retail establishment subject to these guidelines should contribute to the establishment or enhancement of community and public spaces by providing at least two of the following: patio/seating area, pedestrian plaza with benches, transportation center, window shopping walkways, outdoor play area, kiosk area, water feature, clock tower, or other such deliberately shaped area and/or a focal feature or amenity that, in the judgment of the director and the commission, adequately enhances such community and public spaces. Any such areas shall have direct access to the public sidewalk network and such features shall not be constructed of materials that are inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape.

22.64.043 Drive-through facilities.

Intent – Assess, promote and achieve appropriate development of drive-through facilities.

Objectives – 

•    To promote compatible development that fits well with, and improves, its existing or planned context;

•    To protect and enhance the character and quality of the neighborhoods where drive-through facilities are located;

•    To enhance public streets and contribute to a high quality public space;

•    To create efficient stacking movements on site;

•    To create a safe and comfortable pedestrian environment on site; and

•    To minimize impacts on adjacent land uses that could be caused by on-site activities.

Context and Challenges – Drive-through facilities have proven to be successful as they target the mobile and car-oriented market. They may operate 24 hours a day, provide convenience for the traveling public and offer a sense of security for users at night. Drive-through service has been adopted by fast food businesses, financial institutions, dry cleaners, pharmacies and other businesses. Meanwhile, walk-in service is still an important component for many businesses with drive-through facilities for customers who arrive on foot, bicycles and by vehicles but do not use the drive-through services.

While successful and popular, drive-through facilities present many urban design challenges, including respecting the urban context while designing prototypical drive-through facility sites and buildings; supporting a pedestrian-friendly environment along public streets; using landscape areas effectively to improve the overall environmental and visual quality of the area; and designing efficient stacking movements on site.

(a) Locate vehicular access points to the site as far as possible from street intersections. Locate vehicle access points to corner sites on the secondary street (Figure 1).

(b) Locate surface parking areas and stacking lanes at the side or rear of buildings. (Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1:
[IMAGE]


Locating vehicular access points far from the intersection helps reduce potential impacts on the traffic at the intersection.

Figure 2:
[IMAGE]


Locating parking and driveway areas at the rear of the site provides opportunities to frame the street edge with built structures.

(c) Minimize the number and width of driveways from the public street (Figure 3). However, avoid placing entrance or exit lanes between the building and street or sidewalk as shown in the example on the right in Figure 3.

Figure 3:
[IMAGE]


Minimizing the number and width of driveways helps reduce interruptions to the public sidewalk.

(d) Locate the start point to the stacking lane at the rear of the site so that queued vehicles do not block traffic along the public streets or the movement of other vehicles on site (Figure 4).

Figure 4:
[IMAGE]


In these two drive-through sites, start points are located at the rear of the site to minimize the potential impacts on other traffic that could be caused by stacking cars. However, avoid placing entrance or exit lanes between the building and street or sidewalk as shown on the right.

(e) Locate stacking lanes away from adjacent sensitive uses, such as residential and outdoor amenity areas, to reduce the impacts of noise and pollution that could be caused by stacking cars on such uses. Use landscaping and fencing to help buffer potential impacts.

(f) Avoid locating the stacking lane, and entrance or exit lane, between the building and the public street, as noted in the examples in Figures 3 and 4.

(g) Provide escape lanes and the appropriate number of queuing spaces as required in FMC 22.60.012 to create efficient stacking lanes and to minimize on-site conflicts (Figure 5).

Figure 5:
[IMAGE]


In this drive-through site, sufficient queuing spaces are provided. The escape lane allows cars to exit from the stacking lane without having to drive by the pickup window.

(h) Separate stacking lanes from parking areas and driveways using landscaped islands, decorative pavement, pervious islands and painted lines.

(i) Design the on-site circulation to minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles.

(j) Provide separate stacking lanes when two drive-through uses exist on the same site.

(k) Locate noise-generating areas, including ordering board speakers, outdoor loading areas and garbage/recyclables storage, away from sensitive uses such as residential areas, day care facilities and schools.

(l) Buffer potential noise impacts on properties where noise may be detrimental to occupants with solid attenuations such as building structures, landscaped berms or attenuation fencing (minimum six feet in height) complemented with landscaping.

(m) Limit sound emanating from ordering board speakers or other speaker systems to a level that is not audible from residentially used properties or detrimental to occupants of other nearby properties. At no time should any speaker system be audible above ambient noise levels beyond the property lines of the site.

(n) Provide a minimum eight-foot-wide landscape area, which may include a solid wall or fence in addition to planting, at the edges of sites between property lines and nearby entrance lanes, exit lanes, stacking lanes and other drive-through facilities, in order to provide screening and enhance site environmental benefits. (Ord. 1611 § 20, 2018).

22.65.002    Authority.

22.65.003    Design standards and guidelines adopted.

22.65.004    Applicability.


22.65.001 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish streetscape standards and guidelines, including sidewalk, landscaping and street tree requirements, for principal and minor arterials, major collectors, local streets, access lanes, alleys and paseos. (Ord. 1575 § 19, 2016).


22.65.002 Authority.

The provisions of this chapter shall augment other requirements in this title. When provisions included in these design standards and guidelines conflict with other requirements of this title, these standards and guidelines shall apply unless otherwise provided. (Ord. 1575 § 19, 2016).


22.65.003 Design standards and guidelines adopted.

The “City of Fircrest Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements,” as shown in Exhibit “A” to Ordinance No. 1575 and incorporated in this section by reference, is hereby adopted and codified within this title. (Ord. 1575 § 19, 2016).


22.65.004 Applicability.

(a) The design standards and guidelines adopted pursuant to this chapter shall apply to streetscape improvements required in conjunction with development that includes or requires the construction of new streets or the substantial modification of existing streets that would be classified as principal and minor arterials, major collectors, local streets, access lanes, alleys and paseos.

(b) The city shall determine whether modifications to existing streets are considered substantial and therefore subject to compliance with the design standards and guidelines. Pavement overlays not associated with significant changes to pavement section design, and the installation of utilities within a public street ROW, are not considered to be substantial improvements. The construction of sidewalks or curb and gutter where none currently exists, or significant changes to pavement section design, may be considered substantial modifications.

(c) Retrofitting existing streets to accommodate new or modified transit, bicycle or pedestrian facilities shall take into account existing street designs and the challenges associated with designing a project to fit within a previously built environment while complying with the intent of applicable streetscape design standards and guidelines. These provisions are intended to provide the city with sufficient discretion to adjust project designs to effectively transition between new and existing improvements.

(d) The city may apply the design standards and guidelines adopted pursuant to this chapter to new private streets or driveways located within developments that do not include the subdivision of land in order to achieve the same design quality and function as would otherwise be provided by a public street. For example, the city may apply these standards and guidelines to new or substantially modified multifamily development, commercial mixed use development, residential condominium development, or other types of development that rely on private streets or driveways for vehicular and pedestrian access. (Ord. 1575 § 19, 2016).

22.66.001 Statement of policy.

New development can have a detrimental or beneficial effect on the character of the area in which the new development is located. The detrimental effects of one land use on another use or property can be prevented or minimized through zoning, subdivision regulations, and building codes. Other aspects of development, however, are more subtle and less amenable to exacting rules enacted without regard to specific development proposals. Among these aspects of development are the general form of the land before and after development, spatial relationships of the structures and open spaces with adjacent land uses, and the appearance of buildings, signs and open spaces as they contribute to the community. 

One of the paramount goals of the city’s comprehensive plan is to retain or recreate the qualities that comprise livable, memorable and diverse community life within Fircrest. Zoning and other numerical standards and formulas are inadequate tools, by themselves, for building a livable community in that they cannot ensure quality of physical design. Design review is intended to be a complementary means of retaining, enhancing, or creating a sense of community through its physical structures. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.002 Purpose.

The purposes of design review are:

(a) To promote those qualities in the natural environment which will be beneficial to the community.

(b) To foster the attractiveness and functional utility of the community as a place to live and work.

(c) To preserve the special character and quality of Fircrest by maintaining the integrity of those areas which have a discernible character or are of special historic significance.

(d) To raise the level of community expectations for the quality of the built environment.

(e) To encourage originality and creativity in site planning and architecture.

(f) To communicate these purposes to the applicant and to assist the applicant in achieving these purposes.

(g) To consider the applicant’s needs and goals and the broader public impact of any proposal. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.003 Authority.

The director may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny, an application for administrative design review. An administrative design review application shall be approved when the director has determined that the criteria listed in FMC 22.66.006 have been met by the proposal. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.004 Development subject to administrative design review.

The director shall review the following public and private projects which require construction permits or discretionary approval:

(a) New residential, accessory, commercial, industrial, public and quasi-public buildings;

(b) Additions to residential, accessory, commercial, industrial, public and quasi-public buildings;

(c) Facade improvements to commercial and industrial buildings; 

(d) Establishment of an accessory dwelling unit which results in modifications to the exterior of a building, driveway or parking area;

(e) Parking lot improvements, as regulated in Chapter 22.60 FMC;

(f) New signs and modifications to existing signs, excluding changes in copy. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.005 Development exempt from administrative design review.

The following public and private projects are exempt from administrative design review:

(a) Exterior alterations to detached single-family residential buildings, other than additions;

(b) Residential accessory buildings less than or equal to 200 square feet in area, including garages, storage buildings and carports;

(c) Residential accessory structures, including arbors, pergolas, trellises, gazebos and fences;

(d) Uncovered porches, patios, decks, stairs and landings;

(e) Interior improvements. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.006 Criteria for administrative design review approval.

Before any administrative design review approval may be granted, the director shall determine that the following criteria are met by a proposal:

(a) The general design considerations, including the character, scale, quality of design and quality of materials, are consistent with the purpose of this chapter and adopted design guidelines.

(b) The proposal complies with all applicable development standards.

(c) The proposal is consistent with the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.007 Application procedures. 

Administrative design review is classified as a Type II application. The processing procedures for this application are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.008 Administrative design review process.

Administrative design review requires a comprehensive staff review to ensure project compliance with all applicable development regulations contained in this code, the design guidelines adopted in this title and incorporated by reference in Chapter 22.64 FMC, and the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan. Administrative design review may consist of either a one-step or two-step process depending on the complexity of the proposal and the preferences of an applicant. 

(a) One-Step Process. The one-step process consists of a detailed design review typically conducted at the time plans are submitted for a building permit or other construction permit review. 

(b) Two-Step Process. The two-step process typically begins with a review of conceptual plans conducted concurrently with the review of a discretionary land use permit application. Once a discretionary land use approval is granted for a conceptual design, detailed plans shall be prepared by an applicant and submitted for final design review. This second review is intended to ensure that all design issues identified during the review of the conceptual plans are fully addressed prior to issuance of a building permit or other construction permit. An optional two-step process may also be requested by an applicant for a proposal not requiring discretionary land use approval. This option provides an applicant with an opportunity to submit conceptual plans for review prior to the preparation and submittal of detailed plans for a building or other construction permit. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.009 Submittal requirements.

Application for administrative design review shall be submitted on forms provided by the department. A minimum of two sets of the following plans and other information shall be submitted with the application in clear and intelligible form when determined by the director to be applicable and necessary to complete the design review:

(a) Elevation Plans. Elevation plans shall be provided for each building or structure elevation that is subject to design review. Additions and alterations to existing structures shall be clearly identified on the plans. Design details such as exterior finish materials and textures, lighting and other fixtures, and design elements such as beltcourses, brackets, chimneys, cornices, roof overhangs, window trim, sills and sashes, shall be identified. 

(b) Exterior Mechanical Device Screening Plans. All proposed exterior mechanical devices, including roof-mounted equipment and proposed screening, shall be identified on the architectural and mechanical plans. In addition, plans of any proposed screening design shall be submitted. When mechanical plans are submitted without a corresponding building permit application, the location of all exterior and roof-mounted mechanical devices shall be shown on a building elevation plan.

(c) Coordinated Site Design Plan. A site plan shall identify the proposed locations of parking, pedestrian and vehicular circulation areas, trash enclosure areas, mechanical and utility facility areas, building footprints, landscaping, and significant trees to remain and be removed.

To ensure effective implementation of comprehensive plan policies and objectives and development regulations relating to design, applications for administrative design review and other discretionary land use permits for the same proposal shall be submitted concurrently for review. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.010 Administrative design review modification and exemption.

An applicant may request administrative approval of modifications to a plan previously approved for design review by submitting two sets of plans which clearly identify the proposed changes to the previously approved design. The director may determine that:

(a) The proposed modification is exempt from further review because it represents a minor change from the originally approved plans and the criteria listed in FMC 22.66.006 continue to be met by the proposal; or 

(b) The proposed modification is subject to additional review because it represents a major change from the originally approved plans and further review is necessary to determine whether the criteria listed in FMC 22.66.006 would continue to be met by the proposal. 

A request to modify a previously approved design which has been determined to be subject to additional review shall be processed using the same procedures applicable to the original design review process. The director may impose conditions on an exempted modification or a modification subject to further review to ensure that the intent and conditions of the original approval are met. Deviations from a plan approved for design review are not permitted unless an applicant first obtains approval in accordance with this section. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.011 Duration of an administrative design review approval.

In the event that an administrative design approval is not exercised within one year from the effective date of approval, it shall automatically become null and void; provided, however, that for good cause, the director may grant a one-time extension of one year if an extension request is filed with the department no less than 15 days prior to the date of expiration for the administrative design review approval. A properly filed application for a time extension shall stay the effective date of expiration until action on the request has become final. The process for taking action on the request shall be the same used for the original administrative design review application. Before taking action to grant an extension, the director shall determine that the following circumstances exist:

(a) The proposal approved under the terms of the administrative design review approval originally granted remains in conformance with current development standards and design guidelines contained or referenced in this title. (If the proposal no longer conforms to this title as a result of more restrictive standards or guidelines being adopted subsequent to the original approval, the director may consider a modified proposal which would comply with the more restrictive standards or guidelines.)

(b) The findings adopted in support of the original administrative design review request remain valid and supportive of the time extension request. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


22.66.012 Optional administrative design review. 

FMC 22.66.004 identifies categories of projects which the city has determined have the greatest potential to impact a neighborhood or the community. The designs of other projects which are exempt from administrative design review, however, may also have the potential to impact a neighborhood or the community. For example, modifications to historic homes which fail to take into account the original architectural design may be detrimental to the character of the home as well as the historic fabric of the surrounding neighborhood. An individual proposing an exempt project may request a no-fee review of their design by the director. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the individual with specific design guidelines which would apply to the project if it were subject to review under FMC 22.66.004 and to identify possible design solutions which could be used to enhance the quality of the design. The individual will be encouraged, but not required, to design the project in a manner which is consistent with the adopted guidelines. (Ord. 1246 § 19, 2000).


Chapter 22.68 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

Sections:

22.68.001    Purpose.

22.68.002    Authority.

22.68.003    Criteria for conditional use permit approval.

22.68.004    Application procedures.

22.68.005    Submittal requirements.

22.68.006    Amendment of conditional use permit.

22.68.007    Performance bond.

22.68.008    Duration of a conditional use permit approval.

22.68.009    Limitation on refiling of application.


22.68.001 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish decision criteria and procedures for special uses, called conditional uses, which possess unique characteristics. Conditional uses are deemed unique due to factors such as size, technological processes, equipment, type or duration of activity, or location with respect to surroundings, streets, existing improvements, or effects or demands upon public facilities. These uses require a special degree of control to ensure consistency with the comprehensive plan and compatibility with adjacent uses and the character of the surrounding neighborhood or community.

Conditional uses will be subject to review by the hearing examiner and the issuance of a conditional use permit. This process allows the hearing examiner to:

(a) Determine that the location and characteristics of these uses will be compatible with uses permitted in the surrounding area; and

(b) Make further stipulations and conditions that may reasonably ensure that the intent of this title will be served. (Ord. 1638 § 37, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.002 Authority.

The hearing examiner may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny a conditional use permit. The hearing examiner shall grant a conditional use permit when it has determined that the criteria listed in FMC 22.68.003 are met by the proposal. The hearing examiner may impose specific conditions upon the use, including an increase in the standards of this title, which will enable the hearing examiner to make the required findings in FMC 22.68.003. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, restrictions in hours of operations; restrictions on locations of structures and uses; structural restrictions which address safety, noise, light and glare, vibration, odor, views, aesthetics, and other impacts; and increased buffering requirements, including open space, berms, fencing and landscaping. (Ord. 1638 § 38, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.003 Criteria for conditional use permit approval.

Before any conditional use permit may be granted, the hearing examiner shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(a) The proposed use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity; or adversely affect the established character of the surrounding vicinity.

(b) The proposed use will meet or exceed all applicable development, design and performance standards and guidelines required for the specific use, location, or zoning classification.

(c) The proposed use will be consistent and compatible with the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan.

(d) All conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposed use are measurable and can be monitored and enforced. (Ord. 1638 § 39, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.004 Application procedures.

A conditional use permit is classified as a Type III-A application. The processing procedures for this application are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. (Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.005 Submittal requirements.

Application for a conditional use permit shall be submitted on forms provided by the department. A minimum of two sets of plans, materials and other applicable information specified in FMC 22.06.002 shall be submitted with the application. Based on a preliminary review of the proposal, the director may determine that additional information, including the items listed in FMC 22.72.009 (site plan review submittal requirements), is necessary to complete the review and shall be provided by the applicant. (Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.006 Amendment of conditional use permit.

An applicant may request an amendment to an approved conditional use permit by submitting to the department a description of the proposed amendment and accurate plans which clearly identify the proposed changes to the approved design, if applicable. The director may determine that:

(a) The proposed amendment is exempt from further hearing examiner review because it represents a minor change from the terms of the original approval or the originally approved plans and the criteria listed in FMC 22.68.003 continue to be met; or

(b) The proposed amendment is subject to additional hearing examiner review because it represents a major change from the terms of the original approval or to the originally approved plans.

A request to amend an approved conditional use permit which has been determined to be subject to additional review shall be processed using the same procedures applicable to the original conditional use permit process. The hearing examiner may impose conditions on the proposed amendment to ensure that the intent and conditions of the original approval are met. Deviations from an approved conditional use permit are not permitted unless an applicant first obtains approval in accordance with this section. (Ord. 1638 § 40, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.007 Performance bond.

The hearing examiner may require as a condition of conditional use permit approval that the applicant furnish the city with a performance bond, or other form of guarantee deemed acceptable by the city attorney, to secure the applicant’s obligation to complete the provisions and conditions of the permit as approved. (Ord. 1638 § 41, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.008 Duration of a conditional use permit approval.

In the event that a conditional use permit is not exercised within one year from the effective date of approval, it shall automatically become null and void; provided, however, that for good cause, the hearing examiner may grant a one-time extension of one year if an extension request is filed with the department no less than 45 days prior to the date of expiration for the conditional use permit. A properly filed application for a time extension shall stay the effective date of expiration until action on the request has become final. The process for taking action on the request shall be the same used for the original conditional use permit application. Before taking action to grant an extension, the hearing examiner shall adopt written findings showing that the following circumstances exist:

(a) The proposal approved under the terms of the conditional use permit originally granted remains in conformance with current development standards contained in this title. (If the proposal would no longer conform to this title as a result of more restrictive standards being adopted subsequent to the original approval, the hearing examiner may consider a modified proposal which would comply with the more restrictive standards.)

(b) The findings adopted in support of the original conditional use permit request remain valid and supportive of the time extension request. (Ord. 1638 § 42, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).


22.68.009 Limitation on refiling of application.

No application for a conditional use permit shall be accepted for filing by the director within one year following final action in denying an application for a conditional use permit for the same or substantially the same purpose or property. The director shall deem an application to be substantially the same as the conditional use permit denied if the use to which the property is proposed to be put is the same or substantially the same as that which was considered and disallowed by the earlier final action. (Ord. 1246 § 20, 2000).

22.70.008    Duration of an administrative use permit.


22.70.001 Purpose. 

The purpose of this chapter is to establish decision criteria and procedures for uses which, due to their unique qualities, may require additional regulation or other special degrees of control. An administrative review process is required to ensure that the activity, if established, will be in full compliance with applicable regulations and that such uses are compatible with the comprehensive plan, adjacent uses, and the character of the vicinity. (Ord. 1246 § 21, 2000).


22.70.002 Authority.

The director may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny, an administrative use permit. An administrative use permit shall be approved when the director has determined that the criteria listed in FMC 22.70.003 are met by the proposal. The director may impose specific conditions upon the use, including an increase in the standards of this title, which will enable the director to make the required findings in FMC 22.70.003. These conditions may include, but are not limited to restrictions in hours of operations; restrictions on locations of structures and uses; structural requirements which address safety, noise, light and glare, vibration, odor, views, aesthetics and other impacts; and increased buffering requirements, including open space, berms, fencing and landscaping. (Ord. 1246 § 21, 2000).


22.70.003 Criteria for administrative use permit approval.

Before any administrative use permit may be granted, the director shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(a) The proposed use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity; or adversely affect the established character of the surrounding vicinity.

22.72.015    Limitation on refiling of application.


22.72.001 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for the review of commercial, industrial, residential, public and quasi-public developments for which site plan review is required. The site plan review process is intended to enable the appropriate review authority (hearing examiner or director) to evaluate development proposals with respect to architectural design, landscape design, urban form, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, utility design, and site characteristics. The process allows the review authority to condition development proposals to ensure their compatibility with adjoining uses, compliance with development regulations, and consistency with comprehensive plan goals, objectives and policies. The process is intended to run concurrently with the administrative design review process to ensure that all critical design issues are addressed early in the site planning and review stages of project development. (Ord. 1638 § 43, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.002 Authority.

Two types of site plan review are established in this chapter, a “minor,” or administrative review, and a “major,” or hearing examiner review. The director is authorized to review development proposals subject to minor site plan review as listed in FMC 22.72.003. The hearing examiner is authorized to review development proposals subject to major site plan review as listed in FMC 22.72.004. The review authority may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny the application for site plan review. The review authority shall grant site plan approval when it has determined that the criteria listed in FMC 22.72.006 have been met by the proposal. The review authority may impose specific conditions upon the use, including an increase in the standards of this title, which will enable the review authority to make the required findings in FMC 22.72.006. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, restrictions in hours of operations; restrictions on locations of structures and uses; structural restrictions which address safety, noise, light and glare, vibration, odor, views, aesthetics, and other impacts; and increased buffering requirements, including open space, berms, fencing and landscaping. (Ord. 1638 § 44, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.003 Development subject to minor site plan review.

The director shall review the following public and private development proposals which are subject to site plan review:

(a) New commercial, industrial, residential, public and quasi-public buildings less than or equal to 2,000 square feet of gross floor area;

(b) Commercial, industrial, residential, public and quasi-public building additions which are less than or equal to 2,000 square feet of gross floor area; 

(c) Parking lot improvements associated with development proposals listed in subsections (a) and (b) of this section; and

(d) A change of land use at an existing site or structure when the new activity requires either a change in occupancy according to the Uniform Building Code or, in the opinion of the director, results in an intensification of land use and will require new conditions to comply with existing regulations of this title. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.004 Development subject to major site plan review.

The hearing examiner shall review the following public and private development proposals which are subject to site plan review:

(a) New commercial, industrial, residential, public and quasi-public buildings greater than 2,000 square feet of gross floor area; and

(b) Commercial, industrial, residential, public and quasi-public building additions which are greater than 2,000 square feet of gross floor area; and

(c) Parking lot improvements associated with development proposals listed in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. (Ord. 1638 § 45, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.005 Development exempt from site plan review.

The following public and private development proposals are exempt from site plan review:

(a) Uses which are subject to conditional use permit review, administrative use permit review, and preliminary development plan review; and

(b) Uses which are permitted outright, whether or not administrative design review is required. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.006 Criteria for site plan review approval.

Before any site plan approval may be granted, the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(a) The proposed use and site design will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity; or adversely affect the established character of the surrounding vicinity.

(b) The proposed use and site design will meet or exceed all applicable development, design and performance standards and guidelines required for the specific use, location, or zoning classification.

(c) The proposed use and site design will be consistent and compatible with the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan.

(d) All conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposed use are measurable and can be monitored and enforced. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.007 Application procedures.

Minor site plan review is classified as a Type II application and major site plan review is classified as a Type III-A application. The processing procedures for these applications are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.008 Major and minor site plan review.

(a) Minor Site Plan Review. Minor site plan review typically consists of a single review of detailed plans by the director. However, an applicant may elect to submit conceptual plans for a preliminary review to obtain the advice of the director as to the applicability of the intent, standards and provisions of this chapter to the plan. Once the director has provided this advice, the applicant will be directed to prepare and submit detailed plans to the director for a final review.

(b) Major Site Plan Review. Major site plan review consists of two separate reviews. The initial review is conducted by the hearing examiner and the second review is conducted by the director. The plans submitted for the initial review may be conceptual in detail. However, the greater the level of detail in the plans submitted for hearing examiner review, the greater the level of certainty the applicant will have in preparing detailed plans for final review. When the hearing examiner determines that a site plan meets the criteria listed in FMC 22.72.006, the hearing examiner will grant a preliminary approval and direct the applicant to prepare and submit detailed plans to the director for final site plan review. This second review is intended to ensure that all site planning issues identified during the hearing examiner’s initial review are fully addressed prior to issuance of a building permit or other construction permit. (Ord. 1638 § 46, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.009 Submittal requirements.

Application for site plan review shall be submitted on forms provided by the department. A minimum of two sets of the following plans, materials, and other applicable information shall be submitted with the application in clear and intelligible form:

(a) A site plan drawing at a scale of not less than one inch per 50 feet which shows:

(1) The location of all existing and proposed structures and improvements, including, but not limited to, fences, culverts, bridges, roads and streets on the subject property;

(2) The boundaries of the property proposed to be developed and, if the property is to be subdivided, the boundaries of each proposed lot within the property;

(3) All proposed and existing buildings and setback lines, including those located on adjoining properties;

(4) All areas to be preserved as buffers or to be dedicated to a public, private, or community use or for open space and information regarding the percentage of area covered and size and type of existing vegetation to be removed or to be retained;

In addition, a plant schedule indicating species, varieties, sizes and numbers of plant to be installed, and planting specifications shall be submitted (see FMC 22.62.010 for standards);

(f) Topographic map which delineates contours, both existing and proposed, at intervals of two feet, and which locates existing streams, wetlands, forested areas and other natural features;

(g) A grading plan showing existing and proposed grades;

(h) The existing zoning district of the proposed development site and any other zoning district within 300 feet of the site;

(i) Impervious surface calculations, including the proposed number of square feet of surfaces covered by buildings, driveways, parking lots, or any other structure covering land; the total number of square feet in the entire proposed development site; and the percentage of the site covered with impervious surface;

(j) The proposed number of dwelling units and number of bedrooms in the development;

(k) The proposed number of square feet in gross floor area for each commercial, industrial, residential, and other nonresidential use;

(l) A description of each proposed commercial and industrial use;

(m) For properties containing critical areas or their regulated buffers, all informational requirements specified in the critical area regulations shall be included in the site plan submittal; and

(n) The forms, materials and other information specified in FMC 22.06.002. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.010 Waiver of submittal requirements.

The director may waive the submittal requirement for any of the items listed in FMC 22.72.009 when, in the discretion of the director, the item is inapplicable or unnecessary for the review authority to complete the site plan review. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.011 Request for additional information.

The director may require the applicant to submit additional information or material which is necessary for the proper review and hearing of the application. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.012 Amendment of site plan.

An applicant may request an amendment to a previously approved site plan by submitting to the department accurate plans which clearly identify the proposed changes to the approved design. The director may determine that:

(a) The proposed amendment is exempt from further review because it represents a minor change from the originally approved plans and the criteria listed in FMC 22.72.006 continue to be met;

(b) The proposed amendment is subject to additional administrative review because it represents a substantial change to plans which the director previously granted approval of through the minor design review process or the final major design review process; or

(c) The proposed amendment is subject to additional hearing examiner review because it represents a major change to plans which the hearing examiner previously granted approval of through the preliminary major design review process.

A request to amend an approved site plan which has been determined to be subject to additional review shall be processed using the same procedures applicable to the original site plan review process. The review authority may impose conditions on the proposed amendment to ensure that the intent and conditions of the original approval are met. Deviations from an approved site plan are not permitted unless an applicant first obtains approval in accordance with this section. (Ord. 1638 § 47, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.013 Performance bond.

The review authority may require as a condition of site plan review approval that the applicant furnish the city with a performance bond, or other form of guarantee deemed acceptable by the city attorney, to secure the applicant’s obligation to complete the provisions and conditions of the site plan as approved. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.014 Duration of a site plan review approval.

In the event that a site plan approval is not exercised within one year from the effective date of approval, it shall automatically become null and void; provided, however, that for good cause, the review authority may grant a one-time extension of one year if an extension request is filed with the department no less than 15 days prior to the date of expiration for a minor site plan review approval or 45 days prior to the date of expiration for a major site plan approval. A properly filed application for a time extension shall stay the effective date of expiration until action on the request has become final. The process for taking action on the request shall be the same used for the original site plan review application. Before taking action to grant an extension, the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following circumstances exist:

(a) The proposal approved under the terms of the site plan review application originally granted remains in conformance with current development standards or design guidelines contained or referenced in this title. (If the proposal would no longer conform to this title as a result of more restrictive standards or guidelines being adopted subsequent to the original approval, the director or hearing examiner may consider a modified proposal which would comply with the more restrictive standards or guidelines.)

(b) The findings adopted in support of the original site plan review application approval remain valid and supportive of the time extension request. (Ord. 1638 § 48, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


22.72.015 Limitation on refiling of application.

No application for a site plan review shall be accepted for filing by the director within one year following final action in denying an application for a site plan approval for the same or substantially the same purpose or property. The director shall deem an application to be substantially the same as the site plan review application denied if the use to which the property is proposed to be put is the same or substantially the same as that which was considered and disallowed by the earlier final action. (Ord. 1246 § 22, 2000).


Chapter 22.74 VARIANCES

Sections:

22.74.001    Purpose.

22.74.002    Authority – Major and minor variances.

22.74.003    Criteria – Major and minor variance approval.

22.74.004    Application procedures.

22.74.005    Submittal requirements.

22.74.006    Duration of a variance approval.

22.74.007    Limitation on refiling of application.

22.74.008    De minimis variance.


22.74.001 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means of altering the requirements of this title in specific situations where the strict application of those requirements would deprive a property of privileges enjoyed by other properties with the same zoning district classification because of special features or constraints unique to the subject property. (Ord. 1246 § 23, 2000).


22.74.002 Authority – Major and minor variances.

Two types of variances are established in this chapter, a minor, or administrative variance, and a major, or hearing examiner variance. A minor variance is one that is within 10 percent of the standard contained in this title and which may be approved by the director. A major variance is one that is greater than 10 percent of the standard contained in this title and which may be approved by the hearing examiner.

The appropriate review authority (director or hearing examiner) shall grant a variance from the provisions of this title when it has determined that the criteria listed in FMC 22.74.003 have been met by the proposal. When granting a variance, the review authority may attach specific conditions to the variance to ensure that the variance will conform to the criteria listed in FMC 22.74.003 and all other applicable codes, design guidelines, and comprehensive plan goals and policies. The review authority shall not grant a variance which establishes a use otherwise prohibited within a zoning district. (Ord. 1638 § 49, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 23, 2000).


22.74.003 Criteria – Major and minor variance approval.

(a) Before any major variance may be granted, the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(1) There are special circumstances applicable to the subject property or to the intended use such as size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings that do not apply to other property or classes of use in the same vicinity and zoning classification.

(2) The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use which is possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zoning classification but denied to the subject property because of special circumstances.

(3) The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning classification in which the subject property is located.

(4) Strict enforcement of the provisions of this title would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship for the property owner.

(5) The practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship has not been created by the owner or by a predecessor in title. (This finding does not apply if the zoning classification for the property has changed and the difficulty or hardship was created solely as a result of the reclassification.)

(6) The granting of the variance will be consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning classification and the comprehensive plan land use designation of the subject property and will not conflict with other applicable codes, design guidelines, or comprehensive plan goals and policies.

(b) Before any minor variance may be granted, the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(1) The variance will not compromise the intent of the comprehensive plan nor be inconsistent with the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan.

(2) The variance is an immediate remedy to a condition which, if permitted, would not result in any significant adverse impacts to adjacent properties or structures.

(3) A strict application of the standards would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the applicant or property owner.

(4) The need for the variance is not the result of the deliberate actions of the applicant or property owner.

(5) The variance does not create health and safety hazards. (Ord. 1472 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1246 § 23, 2000).


22.74.004 Application procedures.

A minor variance is classified as a Type II application and a major variance is classified as a Type III-A application. The processing procedures for these applications are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. (Ord. 1246 § 23, 2000).


22.74.005 Submittal requirements.

Application for a variance shall be submitted on forms provided by the department. A minimum of two sets of plans, materials and other applicable information specified in FMC 22.06.002 shall be submitted with the application. Based on a preliminary review of the proposal, the director may determine that additional information, including the items listed in FMC 22.72.009 (site plan review submittal requirements), is necessary to complete the review and shall be provided by the applicant. (Ord. 1246 § 23, 2000).


22.74.006 Duration of a variance approval.

In the event that a variance is not exercised within one year from the effective date of approval, it shall automatically become null and void; provided, however, that for good cause, the review authority may grant a one-time extension of one year if an extension request is filed with the department no less than 15 days prior to the date of expiration for a minor variance approval or 45 days prior to the date of expiration for a major variance approval. A properly filed application for a time extension shall stay the effective date of expiration until action on the request has become final. The process for taking action on the request shall be the same used for the original variance application. Before taking action to grant an extension, the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following circumstances exist:

(a) The magnitude or extent of the variance originally granted has not increased as a result of subsequently adopted amendments to this title which impose a more restrictive standard.

(b) The findings adopted in support of the original variance request remain valid and supportive of the time extension request. (Ord. 1246 § 23, 2000).


22.74.007 Limitation on refiling of application.

No application for a variance shall be accepted for filing by the director within one year following final action in denying an application for a variance for the same or substantially the same purpose or property. The director shall deem an application to be substantially the same as the variance denied if the special circumstances which the applicant alleges as a basis for a variance are the same or substantially the same as those considered and rejected in the earlier final action. (Ord. 1246 § 23, 2000).


22.74.008 De minimis variance.

A de minimis variance grants a minimal or minor deviation from a bulk or dimensional zoning requirement. Because such variance does not affect the public interest, it may be granted even though the variance criteria in FMC 22.74.003 have not been met. A de minimis variance is classified as a Type I project permit. The director may grant a de minimis variance subject to the following criteria being met:

(a) The deviation being sought does not exceed 12 inches for building height or setback, or one percent for measurements pertaining to lot dimensions or area.

(b) Rigid compliance with the bulk or dimensional zoning requirement is not necessary to protect the public interest or public policy concerns inherent in this title.

(c) A redesign of a proposal to fully comply with the bulk or dimensional zoning requirement would be infeasible or impracticable. (Ord. 1575 § 20, 2016).

22.76.001 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for the review of residential planned developments. The planned development review process is intended to enable the review authority to evaluate development plans with respect to neighborhood compatibility, environmental sensitivity, architectural design, landscape design, urban form, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, utility design, recreation and open space needs, site characteristics and the extent to which the community’s housing needs are met by the proposal. The process allows the appropriate review authority (city council, hearing examiner, or director) to condition development proposals to ensure their compatibility with adjoining uses, compliance with development regulations, and conformance with comprehensive plan goals, objectives and policies. The process is intended to run concurrently with the administrative design review process to ensure that all critical design issues are addressed early in the site planning and review stages of project development. The process is also intended to run concurrently with the short plat or preliminary and final plat review processes. (Ord. 1638 § 50, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.002 Intent.

The intent of the planned development regulations is:

(a) To permit greater flexibility and, consequently, more creative and imaginative design than generally is possible under conventional zoning regulations, when such design is required for new development in specified zoning districts;

(b) To promote urban infilling and more economical and efficient use of land;

(c) To cluster development in order to preserve significant wildlife habitat and take the greatest possible advantage of existing topography and other natural features to promote environmental and aesthetic goals by optimizing siting, orientation, layout and design of structures to protect natural vegetation, wetlands, drainage areas, slopes and other natural features;

(d) To provide more usable and suitably located recreation facilities and other public and common facilities than would otherwise be provided under conventional land development procedures;

(e) To provide a variety of housing choices and a high level of urban amenities which contribute to a strong sense of community;

(f) To ensure that new development is compatible with adjoining neighborhoods and existing and potential future land uses within the community; and

(g) To ensure that the design of the development is exemplary and the amenities to be provided are substantially greater than minimum standards of the underlying zoning district would otherwise require. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.003 Authority.

The city council may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny, a preliminary development plan for a planned development. The director may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny, a final development plan for a planned development. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.004 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to R-4-C, R-8, and R-10-TCD zoning districts, and to uses which may be authorized through a planned development review process. Any proposal to modify a development that was authorized through an alternative procedure prior to the establishment of this chapter shall be considered through the site plan approval process in Chapter 22.72 FMC unless the applicant requests approval of a development plan for a modified proposal under this chapter. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.005 Criteria for planned development approval.

Before a development plan approval may be granted, the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(a) The proposed development is consistent with the intent of this chapter as articulated in FMC 22.76.002.

(b) The proposed development is in substantial conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.

(c) Any exceptions from the standards of the underlying zoning district are warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development plan and program.

(d) The approval will result in a superior design which could not be achieved under conventional zoning regulations or another zoning district.

(e) The system of ownership and means of developing, preserving and maintaining open space, recreational facilities and other common amenities is suitable and feasible.

(f) For final development plans, the proposed design is in substantial conformance with the preliminary development plan and satisfies all conditions of preliminary development approval. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.006 Application procedures.

The processing of an application for a planned development requires a three-step review. The hearing examiner shall conduct an open record public hearing and forward the hearing examiner’s recommendations to the city council on a preliminary development plan, which is classified as a Type III-B application. The city council shall conduct a closed record public hearing and consider the recommendations of the hearing examiner before taking action on a preliminary development plan. The director shall conduct an administrative review of a final development plan, which is classified as a Type II application. The processing procedures for these applications are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. (Ord. 1638 § 51, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.007 Submittal requirements.

(a) Application for preliminary development plan review shall be submitted on forms provided by the department. A minimum of two sets of plans, materials and other applicable information specified below and in FMC 22.06.002 shall be submitted with the application in clear and intelligible form:

(1) Documentation listed in FMC 22.72.009 (site plan submittal requirements);

(2) Description of proposed phasing;

(3) Design guidelines generated by the applicant for the project;

(4) Critical area analyses and reports;

(5) Preliminary or short plat submittals; and

(6) Description of specific development standards to be applied to the project, including building heights, building setbacks and build-to lines, individual lot sizes and lot dimensions, and similar provisions.

(b) The director may waive the submittal requirement for any of the items listed in subsection (a) of this section when, in the discretion of the director, the item is inapplicable or unnecessary for the review authority to complete the preliminary development plan review. In such case, the director shall provide the hearing examiner with a list of the items waived for submittal. The director may also require the applicant to submit additional information or material which it finds is necessary for the proper review and hearing of the application.

(c) Application for final development plan review shall be on forms provided by the department. The applicant shall submit the documentation identified by the director as being necessary for the proper review of the application based on the conditions imposed by the review authority during the preliminary development plan review process and issues identified subsequent to the approval of the preliminary development plan. (Ord. 1638 § 52, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.008 Amendment of development plan.

(a) An applicant may request an amendment to a previously approved preliminary or final development plan by submitting to the department accurate plans which clearly identify the proposed changes to the approved design. The director may determine that:

(1) The proposed amendment is exempt from further review because it represents a minor change from the previously approved preliminary or final development plan and the criteria listed in FMC 22.76.005 continue to be met;

(2) The proposed amendment is subject to additional administrative review because it represents a major change to the final development plan previously approved by the director; or

(3) The proposed amendment is subject to additional hearing examiner and city council review because it represents a major change to the preliminary development plan previously reviewed by the hearing examiner and approved by the city council.

(b) Major amendments are those which substantially change the character, basic design, density, open space or other requirements or conditions of the development plan. Minor amendments are those which may affect the precise dimensions or siting of buildings (i.e., lot coverage, building height, setbacks, etc.), but which do not affect the basic character or arrangement and number of buildings approved in the preliminary or final development plan, nor the density of the development or the amount and quality of open space and landscaping. Such dimensional adjustments shall not vary more than 10 percent from the original plan approved by the city. Minor amendments also include on-site adjustments which may affect the design and placement of circulation and utility facilities and other improvements, provided they do not substantially change the character, basic design, density, open space or other requirements or conditions of the development plan.

(c) An amendment request which has been determined to be subject to additional review shall be processed using the same procedures applicable to the initial development plan review process. The review authority may impose conditions on the proposed amendment to ensure that the intent and conditions of the original approval are met. Deviations from an approved development plan are not permitted unless an applicant first obtains approval in accordance with this section. (Ord. 1638 § 53, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.009 Processing of associated permits.

(a) When any parcel of land in a planned development is intended for individual ownership or sale, the platting and procedural requirements of this title and applicable state laws pertaining to the subdivision and conveyance of land and the preparation of maps shall be followed. Applications for preliminary or short plat approval shall be submitted simultaneously, and processed concurrently, with applications for preliminary development plan approval.

(b) When a conditional use listed in the underlying zoning district is authorized under the preliminary development plan review process, the procedure for reviewing a conditional use permit process shall be waived. When a conditional use listed in the underlying zoning district is proposed subsequent to the granting of a preliminary development plan approval, the conditional use permit procedures in Chapter 22.68 FMC shall apply.

(c) An approved preliminary development plan is classified as an amendment to the official zoning map. The procedure for reviewing a zoning map amendment as a separate application shall be waived. A reference to the appropriate city council ordinance approving the preliminary development plan and its effective date shall be placed on the official zoning map. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.010 Submittal of final development plan.

The applicant shall submit a final development plan for administrative approval within three years of the effective date of preliminary development plan approval. The director shall approve the final development plan after finding that the final development plan has been completed in accordance with the provisions of the preliminary development plan approval, that all required improvements have been completed or arrangements or contracts have been entered into to guarantee that the required improvements will be completed, and that the interests of the city are fully protected. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.011 Duration of a preliminary development plan approval.

In the event that a complete final development plan application has not been submitted within three years from the effective date of preliminary development plan approval, the preliminary approval shall automatically become null and void; provided, however, that for good cause, the hearing examiner may grant a one-time extension of one year if an extension request is filed with the department no less than 45 days prior to the date of expiration for the preliminary development plan approval. A properly filed application for a time extension shall stay the effective date of expiration until action on the request has become final. The process for taking action on the request shall be the same used for the original preliminary development plan application at the hearing examiner level of review. Before taking action to grant an extension, the hearing examiner shall adopt written findings showing that the following circumstances exist:

(a) The proposal approved under the terms of the preliminary development plan approval originally granted remains in conformance with current development standards contained in this title. (If the proposal would no longer conform to this title as a result of more restrictive standards being adopted subsequent to the original approval, the hearing examiner may consider a modified proposal which would comply with the more restrictive standards.)

(b) The findings adopted in support of the original preliminary development plan remain valid and supportive of the time extension request. (Ord. 1638 § 54, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.012 Revocation of a final development plan approval.

In the event that a final development plan has been granted approval and it appears that the project is not progressing in a reasonable and consistent manner or the project has been abandoned, action may be initiated pursuant to Chapter 22.96 FMC to revoke the planned development approval. When revocation has been enacted upon a planned development, the zoning map amendment authorized through the preliminary development plan review process shall be revoked and the zoning classification returned to its original status. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.013 Phasing.

If a planned development is to be developed in phases, the project as a whole shall be portrayed on the preliminary development plan, and each phase shall individually receive final development plan approval pursuant to the procedures in this title. Those portions of the planned development which have received preliminary development plan approval but which have not yet received final development plan approval shall be subject to the permit expiration provisions of FMC 22.76.010. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.014 Limitation on refiling of application.

No application for a preliminary development plan shall be accepted for filing by the director within one year following final action in denying an application for a preliminary development plan approval for the same or substantially the same purpose or property. The director shall deem an application to be substantially the same as the preliminary development plan application denied if the use to which the property is proposed to be put is the same or substantially the same as that which was considered and disallowed by the earlier final action. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.015 Permits.

(a) Engineering permits may be issued for development within a planned development prior to final development plan approval, provided that:

(1) The improvements will be consistent with the preliminary development plan approval;

(2) The improvements will be constructed in conformance with all applicable development standards;

(3) All required improvements have been completed or arrangements or contracts have been entered into to guarantee that the required improvements will be completed for the phase of the project involved; and

(4) Partial or complete construction of improvements shall not relieve the developer from, nor impair city enforcement of, conditions of preliminary development plan approval.

(b) Building permits shall not be issued for any structure within a planned development prior to the approval of a final development plan. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.016 Open space.

(a) Open space is considered an essential component of a planned development which supports the intent of this chapter as articulated in FMC 22.76.002. Open space shall be provided in a manner consistent with the specifications of the underlying zoning district. The proportion of private and public open space and the amount of land area devoted to common open space and common active recreational areas shall be determined through the preliminary development plan review process. For the purposes of this chapter, the following descriptions shall apply:

(1) Common Open Space. Common open space consists primarily of large usable areas which may include, but are not limited to sensitive area management tracts, wetland buffers, stormwater facilities, buffer yards, public space, landscaped or natural areas, recreational areas or an area for a recreation/socialization facility.

(2) Common Active Recreational Areas. Common active recreational areas include, but are not limited to pedestrian trails, pools, child play areas, improved picnic areas and recreational buildings. Common recreational facilities, such as trails, play fields, community centers, sport courts and picnic areas should be provided when determined by the city to be appropriate for the site and its intended use. A common facility or open space should be an integral part of a planned development by being centrally located and accessible to all occupants, and having buildings facing, rather than backing, onto it.

(b) Open space and active recreational areas which are to be available for the common use of the residents of the planned development shall be either:

(1) Owned in common and maintained by the property owners within the framework of a homeowner’s association or comparable body; or

(2) Conveyed to a public agency that will agree to maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures or improvements which have been placed on it. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.017 Maintenance requirements.

Property within a planned development which is individually owned shall be maintained by the property owner. The maintenance of any common property shall be the responsibility of all property owners within the development. Required maintenance of any common facilities, including but not limited to common private streets and alleys, parking, circulation areas, open spaces, trails and stormwater facilities, shall be ensured by covenants approved by the city. Failure to maintain any common area or amenity shall be considered a violation of this title. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.018 Guarantees.

Before approval of a final development plan may be granted, the applicant shall submit to the city all necessary covenants, deeds and/or association by-laws and other documents guaranteeing maintenance, construction, common fee ownership, if applicable, of open space, community facilities, stormwater facilities, private roads and alleys, and all other commonly owned and operated property. The review authority may require as a condition of development plan approval that the applicant furnish the city with a performance bond, or other form of guarantee deemed acceptable by the city attorney, to secure the applicant’s obligation to complete the provisions and conditions of the development plan as approved. The city shall release the bond or other guarantee when the improvements have been completed in accordance with the development plan. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.019 Parties bound.

All persons and parties, their successors, heirs or assigns, who own, have or will have, by virtue of purchase, inheritance or assignment, any interest in the real property within an approved planned development, shall be bound by the conditions of the planned development. Failure to comply with such conditions shall be grounds for a revocation of the planned development by the city. (Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).


22.76.020 Development and design standards.

	Maximum density	Specified in the underlying zoning district.

	Minimum and maximum lot area	To be determined through the preliminary development plan review process.

	Maximum height of buildings and structures	Specified in the underlying zoning district. The review authority may increase height in relationship to provisions for greater open space and separation between buildings on the same or adjoining property when adequate provision is made for light, air and safety.

	Minimum and maximum front yard, interior side yard, side street side yard, alley, and rear yard setback	To be determined through the preliminary development plan review process.

	Minimum setback for yards abutting the exterior boundary of the planned development	Specified in the underlying zoning district.

	Accessory building and structure standards	To be determined through the preliminary development plan review process.

	Maximum lot coverage for structures	To be determined through the preliminary development plan review process.

	Maximum impervious surface coverage	Specified in the underlying zoning district.

	Minimum site area for a planned development	None.

	Permitted uses	All uses listed as permitted uses, accessory uses or conditional uses within the underlying zoning district.

	Common open space and common active recreational areas	Minimum percentage of site required as common open space or common active recreational areas, and mandatory types of common space or facilities, are to be determined through the preliminary development plan review process.

	Calculations resulting in a fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with .50 being rounded up.

(Ord. 1246 § 24, 2000).

This title and the official zoning map may be amended whenever required by public necessity, convenience or welfare. The intent of this chapter is to establish authority and procedure for such amendments. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.002 Amendment authority.

The city council is authorized to amend this title and the official zoning map, subject to the procedures described within this chapter. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.003 Initiation of amendment.

Amendments to this title and the official zoning map may be initiated by:

(a) The adoption of a motion by the city council requesting the planning commission to set a matter for hearing and recommendation;

(b) The adoption of a motion by the planning commission;

(c) Application by one or more owners of property which is proposed to be reclassified, or by contract purchasers who are directly affected by the proposal or an optionee with the written consent of the owner of the subject property; or

(d) Application by a city department. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.004 Criteria for amendment approval.

Before the hearing examiner may recommend approval of an amendment request, and before the city council may approve the amendment, each review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

(a) The proposed amendment is consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan.

(b) The proposed amendment will promote, rather than detract from, the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.

(c) The proposed zoning is compatible with the uses and zoning of surrounding property (required only for zoning map amendments).

(d) The property is suited for the uses allowed in the proposed zoning classification (required only for zoning map amendments).

(e) A change of conditions has occurred within the neighborhood or community since adoption of the comprehensive plan, this title, and amendments thereto, to warrant a determination that the proposed amendment is in the public interest (required only for zoning map amendments and amendments to this title which require a comprehensive plan amendment to ensure consistency under subsection (a) of this section).

(f) Except for the extension of existing district boundaries, no change in any use district, classification or official zoning map shall be considered if it contains fewer than one acre, excluding public streets or alley rights-of-way. (Ord. 1638 § 55, 2019; Ord. 1488 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1467 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.005 Application procedures.

A quasi-judicial zoning map amendment is classified as a Type III-B application. An area-wide zoning map amendment and a development regulation amendment are classified as Type V (legislative) applications. The processing procedures for these applications are described in Chapters 22.05, 22.06, 22.07, 22.08, 22.09 and 22.10 FMC. (Ord. 1638 § 56, 2019; Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.006 Submittal requirements.

Application for a zoning map amendment or development regulation amendment shall be submitted on forms provided by the department. For zoning map amendments, the applicant shall provide an accurate map and legal description of the subject property. For development regulation amendments, the applicant shall identify each chapter, section, paragraph, sentence and word subject to the amendment request and provide the exact text changes which are being proposed. The applicant shall also provide the applicable information specified in FMC 22.06.002. Based on a preliminary review of the proposal, the director may determine that additional information is necessary to complete the review and shall be provided by the applicant. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.007 Contract zoning.

An owner of land in the city may propose a contract as a condition of a zoning map amendment in order to mitigate otherwise unacceptable adverse impacts of the proposed action. Contract zoning shall not decrease or waive any of the requirements within this title or any other title within this code. A proposed contract shall be included with the initiation request described in FMC 22.78.003(c).

An adopted zoning contract shall run with the land covered and shall be considered an additional regulation applicable to any and all matters regulated by this title. Failure by any person, firm or corporation to fulfill the zoning contract shall be considered a violation of this title and, upon action by the city council, may be grounds for rescinding the rezone action or portions thereof. Upon rescindment, the subject property shall revert to the previous zoning district classification. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.008 Annexation map amendment.

The official zoning map shall be amended upon annexation of property into the city.

(a) Default Zoning District upon Annexation. All property annexed into the city subsequent to the adoption of this chapter shall be designated the zoning district classification identified for the property on the official zoning map unless a different zoning classification has been approved by the city council prior to annexation.

(b) City Council Zoning Map Amendment upon Annexation. The city council may approve a zoning map amendment as part of the ordinance approving an annexation. The map amendment shall be subject to the amendment procedure described in this chapter.

(c) Petitioner for Annexation Zoning Map Amendment Request. Petitioners for annexation may request an annexation area zoning district classification which differs from the default classification identified on the official zoning map. The petitioners shall include the map amendment request with the notice of intent to commence annexation proceedings. The request shall follow the amendment procedure described in this chapter. The city council’s determination on the request shall be incorporated into the ordinance adopting the annexation. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.009 Changes to a proposal during public review process.

A proposed amendment may be modified during the public review process without further legal notice being given; provided, that the modification does not exceed the scope of the legal notice published for the original proposal. When changes are proposed which exceed the scope of the legal notice given, no further action shall be taken on the matter until further legal notice has been published in accordance with Chapter 22.07 FMC. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.010 Limitation on refiling of application.

No application for an amendment shall be accepted for filing by the director within one year following final action in denying an application for an amendment for the same or substantially the same purpose or property. (Ord. 1246 § 25, 2000).


22.78.011 Timing for processing zoning map, area-wide zoning map, and comprehensive plan map amendments.

(a) A legislative comprehensive plan map amendment and quasi-judicial zoning map amendment may be conducted in phases, or they may be conducted concurrently provided final action is first taken on the plan map amendment and further provided the applicant submits a written waiver of the deadline for issuance of a final decision of the zoning map amendment, which is 120 days from the city making a determination that a Type III-B project permit application is complete.

(b) A legislative comprehensive plan map amendment and a legislative area-wide zoning map amendment may be conducted in phases or concurrently, provided final action is first taken on the plan map amendment. (Ord. 1638 § 57, 2019).

(a) For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the city manager or his/her designee.

(b) For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the lead agency or responsible official by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in WAC 173-806-020.

(c) The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC, and make them available in accordance with Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-040, filed 6/15/84. Formerly WAC 173-805-115.) (Ord. 1535 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1206 § 3, 1998).


22.81.040 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.

(a) The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

(b) When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.

(c) When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

(d) If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and be resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination or the city must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by the planning/building director.

(e) Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

(f) Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal. (That is: which agencies require nonexempt licenses?) (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-050, filed 6/15/84. Formerly WAC 173-805-070.) (Ord. 1535 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1206 § 3, 1998).


22.81.050 Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the city’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-053, filed 6/15/84. Formerly WAC 173-805-053.) (Ord. 1535 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1206 § 3, 1998).


22.81.060 Additional timing considerations.

(a) For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the hearing examiner or planning commission.

(b) If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-058, filed 6/15/84. Formerly Chapter 173-805 WAC.) (Ord. 1638 § 58, 2019; Ord. 1535 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1206 § 3, 1998).

22.82.020 Flexible thresholds for categorical exemptions. 

(a) The city establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under WAC 197-11-800(1)(b) based on local conditions:

(1) For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i), up to four dwelling units;

(2) For agricultural structures in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(ii), up to 10,000 square feet;

(3) For office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage buildings in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii), up to 4,000 square feet and up to 20 parking spaces;

(4) For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iv), up to 20 parking spaces;

(5) For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v), up to 100 cubic yards.

(b) Whenever the city establishes new exempt levels under this section, it shall send them to the Department of Ecology, Headquarters Office, Olympia, Washington, 98504, under WAC 197-11-800(1)(c). (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-070, filed 6/15/84. Formerly Chapter 173-805 WAC.) (Ord. 1206 § 4, 1998).


22.82.030 Use of exemptions.

(a) Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

(b) In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

(c) If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this title except that:

(1) The city shall not give authorization for:

(A) Any nonexempt action,

(B) Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact, or 

(C) Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives;

(2) A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

(3) A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-080, filed 6/15/84. Formerly WAC 173-805-060.) (Ord. 1206 § 4, 1998).


22.82.040 Environmental checklist.

(a) A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.

(b) For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. Where an expanded checklist is required by the city, technical studies shall be prepared under the direction of the responsible official. If the studies are prepared by a consultant, selection shall be by mutual agreement of the city and applicant, and the consultant may be managed by the city at the city’s sole discretion. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

(c) The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

(1) The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

(2) The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.

(d) For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the city shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. If a modified form is prepared, it must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a 30-day review prior to use. The city shall:

(1) Develop a modified environmental checklist form and adopt it along with or as part of a planned action ordinance; or

(2) Develop a modified environmental checklist form and send it to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a 30-day review prior to use. (RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-090, filed 6/15/84. Formerly WAC 173-805-090.) (Ord. 1206 § 4, 1998).


22.82.050 Mitigated DNS.

(a) As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

(b) An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

(1) Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

(2) Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

(c) The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 20 working days. The response shall:

(1) Be written;

(2) State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and

(3) State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

(d) As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

(e) When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal.

(1) If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

(2) If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

(3) The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent stormwater runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location” are adequate.

(4) Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

(f) A mitigated DNS is issued under either WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355(5) which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application.

(g) Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.

(h) If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).

 (i) The city’s written response under subsection (b) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-100, filed 6/15/84. Formerly Chapter 173-805 WAC.) (Ord. 1206 § 4, 1998).

(2) A finding is made that there are no reasonable mitigation measures capable of being accomplished that are sufficient to mitigate the identified impact; and

(3) The denial is based on one or more policies identified in subsection (d) of this section and identified in writing in the decision document.

(d) The city designates and adopts by reference the following policies as the basis for the city’s exercise of authority pursuant to this section:

(1) The city shall use all practicable means, consistent with other essential considerations of state policy, to improve and coordinate plans, functions, programs and resources to the end that the state and its citizens may:

Such appeal may be perfected by the proponent or any aggrieved party by giving notice to the responsible official within 10 days of the decision being appealed. Review by the city council shall be on a de novo basis. (Statutory authority: RCW 43.21C.130. 84-13-036 (Order DE 84-25), WAC 173-806-160, filed 6/15/84.

In the appeal, the city council shall review the hearing examiner’s open record hearing decision in a closed record appeal as described in Chapter 22.10 FMC. The record on appeal shall consist of the hearing examiner’s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision; a taped or written transcript of the hearing; and any exhibits accepted into evidence at the hearing. No other evidence shall be considered unless it can be shown that the hearing examiner erred in excluding such evidence.

(g) The city council’s decision on project mitigation or denial, and the underlying permits, shall be the final decision of the city. Appeals of the city council’s decision shall be filed in the Pierce County superior court.

22.92.360    Critical area inspections.


22.92.010 Purpose.

(a) The purpose of the city’s critical areas regulations contained in Chapters 22.92, 22.93, 22.94, 22.95, 22.96, 22.97, 22.99 and 22.100 FMC is to designate and classify ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas and to protect these areas and their functions and values, while also allowing for reasonable use of private property.

(b) These regulations are to implement the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the city’s comprehensive plan and the Growth Management Act.

(c) The city finds that critical areas provide a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its residents, and/or may pose a threat to human safety or to public and private property. The beneficial functions and values provided by critical areas include, but are not limited to, water quality protection and enhancement, fish and wildlife habitat, food chain support, flood storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwaters, ground water recharge and discharge, erosion control, protection from hazards, historical, archaeological, and aesthetic value protection, and recreation. These beneficial functions are not listed in order of priority.

(d) Goals. By limiting development and alteration of critical areas, these regulations seek to:

(1) Protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from injury, loss of life, or property damage due to landslides and steep slope failures, erosion, seismic events, or flooding;

(2) Maintain healthy, functioning ecosystems through the protection of unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment, including ground and surface waters, wetlands, and fish and wildlife and their habitats, and to conserve the biodiversity of plant and animal species;

(3) Direct activities not dependent on critical areas resources to less ecologically sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas; and

(4) Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality, wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat, and the overall net loss of wetlands, frequently flooded areas, and habitat conservation areas.

(e) These regulations are intended to protect critical areas in accordance with the Growth Management Act and through the application of the best available science, as determined according to WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925, and in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals.

(f) These regulations are to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. Consistent with RCW 36.70A.020(12), it is not the intent of these regulations to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable economic use of the property or to prevent the provision of public facilities and services necessary to support existing development and planned for by the community without decreasing current service levels below minimum standards.

(g) The city’s enactment or enforcement of these regulations shall not be construed for the benefit of any individual person or group of persons other than the general public. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.020 Authority.

(a) As provided herein, the director is given the authority to interpret and apply, and the responsibility to enforce these regulations, to accomplish the stated purpose.

(b) The city may withhold, condition, or deny development permits or activity approvals to ensure that the proposed action is consistent with these regulations. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.030 Relationship to other regulations.

(a) These critical areas regulations shall apply as an overlay and in addition to zoning and other regulations adopted by the city.

(b) Any individual critical area adjoined by another type of critical area shall have the buffer and meet the requirements that provide the most protection to the critical areas involved. When any existing regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflicts with these critical areas regulations, that regulation which provides more protection to the critical areas shall apply.

(c) These critical areas regulations shall apply concurrently with review conducted under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), as adopted by the city. Any conditions required pursuant to these regulations shall be included in the SEPA review and threshold determination.

(d) Compliance with these critical areas regulations does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, Hydraulic Permit Act (HPA) permits, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permits, and National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in the city’s critical areas regulations. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.040 Jurisdiction – Critical areas.

(a) The city shall regulate all uses, activities, and developments within, adjacent to, or likely to affect, one or more critical areas, consistent with the best available science and the provisions herein.

(b) Critical areas regulated by this title include:

(1) Wetlands as designated in Chapter 22.93 FMC;

(2) Critical aquifer recharge areas as designated in Chapter 22.94 FMC;

(3) Frequently flooded areas as designated in Chapter 22.99 FMC;

(4) Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas as designated in Chapter 22.97 FMC; and

(5) Geologically hazardous areas as designated in Chapter 22.100 FMC.

(c) All areas within the city meeting the definition of one or more critical areas, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of the applicable critical areas chapters.

(d) Areas Adjacent to Critical Areas Subject to Regulation. Areas adjacent to critical areas shall be considered to be within the jurisdiction of these requirements and regulations to support the intent of the applicable critical areas chapters and ensure protection of the functions and values of critical areas. “Adjacent” shall mean any activity located:

(1) On a site immediately adjoining a critical area;

(2) A distance equal to or less than the required critical area buffer width and building setback;

(3) A distance equal to or less than 800 feet from a bald eagle nest;

(4) A distance equal to or less than 300 feet upland from a stream, wetland, or water body; or

(5) Within the floodway, floodplain, or channel migration zone. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.050 Protection of critical areas.

Any action taken pursuant to the applicable critical areas chapters shall result in equivalent or greater functions and values of the critical areas associated with the proposed action, as determined by the best available science. All actions and developments shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the mitigation sequencing order specified in FMC 22.92.190 to avoid, minimize, and restore all adverse impacts. Applicants must first demonstrate an inability to avoid or reduce impacts before restoration and compensation of impacts will be allowed. No activity or use shall be allowed that results in a net loss of the functions or values of critical areas. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.060 Best available science.

(a) Protect Functions and Values of Critical Areas with Special Consideration to Anadromous Fish. Critical area reports and decisions to alter critical areas shall rely on the best available science to protect the functions and values of critical areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish, such as salmon and bull trout, and their habitat, consistent with RCW 36.70A.172.1.

(b) Best Available Science to Be Consistent with Criteria. The best available science is that scientific information applicable to the critical area prepared by local, state, or federal natural resource agencies, a qualified scientific professional, or team of qualified scientific professionals that is consistent with criteria established in WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925.

(c) Characteristics of a Valid Scientific Process. In the context of critical areas protection, a valid scientific process is one that produces reliable information useful in understanding the consequences of a local government’s regulatory decisions, and in developing critical areas policies and development regulations that will be effective in protecting the functions and values of critical areas. To determine whether information received during the permit review process is reliable scientific information, the director shall determine whether the source of the information displays the characteristics of a valid scientific process. Such characteristics are as follows:

(1) Peer Review. The information has been critically reviewed by other persons who are qualified scientific experts in that scientific discipline. The proponents of the information have addressed the criticism of the peer reviewers. Publication in a refereed scientific journal usually indicates that the information has been appropriately peer-reviewed;

(2) Methods. The methods used to obtain the information are clearly stated and reproducible. The methods are standardized in the pertinent scientific discipline or, if not, the methods have been appropriately peer-reviewed to ensure their reliability and validity;

(3) Logical Conclusions and Reasonable Inferences. The conclusions presented are based on reasonable assumptions supported by other studies and consistent with the general theory underlying the assumptions. The conclusions are logically and reasonably derived from the assumptions and supported by the data presented. Any gaps in information and inconsistencies with other pertinent scientific information are adequately explained;

(4) Quantitative Analysis. The data have been analyzed using appropriate statistical or quantitative methods;

(5) Context. The information is placed in proper context. The assumptions, analytical techniques, data, and conclusions are appropriately framed with respect to the prevailing body of pertinent scientific knowledge; and

(6) References. The assumptions, analytical techniques, and conclusions are well-referenced with citations to relevant, credible literature and other pertinent existing information.

(d) Nonscientific Information. Nonscientific information may supplement scientific information, but it is not an adequate substitute for valid and available scientific information. Common sources of nonscientific information include the following:

(1) Anecdotal Information. One or more observations that are not part of an organized scientific effort (for example, “I saw a bald eagle in that area while I was hiking”);

(2) Non-Expert Opinion. Opinion of a person who is not a qualified scientific expert in a pertinent scientific discipline (for example, “I do not believe there are bald eagles in that area”); and

(3) Hearsay. Information repeated from communication with others (for example, “At a lecture last week, Dr. Jones said there were no bald eagles in that area”).

(e) Absence of Valid Scientific Information. Where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area leading to uncertainty about the risk to critical area function of permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area, the director shall:

(1) Take a “precautionary” or a “no-risk approach,” that strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved; and

(2) Require application of an effective adaptive management program that relies on scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and nonregulatory actions protect the critical area. An adaptive management program is a formal and deliberate scientific approach to taking action and obtaining information in the face of uncertainty. An adaptive management program shall:

(A) Address funding for the research component of the adaptive management program;

(B) Change course based on the results and interpretation of new information that resolves uncertainties; and

(C) Commit to the appropriate timeframe and scale necessary to reliably evaluate regulatory and nonregulatory actions affecting protection of critical areas and anadromous fisheries. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.070 Applicability.

(a) The provisions of the critical areas chapters shall apply to all lands, all land uses and development activity, and all structures and facilities in the city, whether or not a permit or authorization is required, and shall apply to every person, firm, partnership, corporation, group, governmental agency, or other entity that owns, leases, or administers land within the city. No person, company, agency, or applicant shall alter a critical area or buffer except as consistent with the purposes and requirements of these chapters.

(b) The city shall not approve any permit or otherwise issue any authorization to alter the condition of any land, water, or vegetation, or to construct or alter any structure or improvement in, over, or on a critical area or associated buffer, without first ensuring compliance with the requirements of these chapters.

(c) Approval of a permit or development proposal pursuant to the provisions of these chapters does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of these chapters. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.080 Exemptions.

(a) Exemption Request and Review Process. The proponent of the activity may submit a written request for exemption to the director that describes the activity and states the exemption listed in this section that applies.

The director shall review the exemption request to verify that it complies with the applicable critical areas chapters and approve or deny the exemption. If the exemption is approved, it shall be placed on file with the department. If the exemption is denied, the proponent may continue in the review process and shall be subject to the requirements of these chapters.

(b) Exempt Activities and Impacts to Critical Areas. All exempted activities shall use reasonable methods to avoid potential impacts to critical areas. To be exempt from the applicable critical areas chapters does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense.

(c) Exempt Activities. The following developments, activities, and associated uses shall be exempt from the provisions of the applicable critical areas chapters; provided, that they are otherwise consistent with the provisions of other local, state, and federal laws and requirements:

(1) Emergencies. Those activities necessary to prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, or that pose an immediate risk of damage to private property and that require remedial or preventative action in a timeframe too short to allow for compliance with the requirements of these chapters.

Emergency actions that create an impact to a critical area or its buffer shall use reasonable methods to address the emergency; in addition, they must have the least possible impact to the critical area or its buffer. The person or agency undertaking such action shall notify the city within one working day following commencement of the emergency activity. Within 30 days, the director shall determine if the action taken was within the scope of the emergency actions allowed in this subsection. If the director determines that the action taken, or any part of the action taken, was beyond the scope of an allowed emergency action, then enforcement provisions of FMC 22.92.290 shall apply.

After the emergency, the person or agency undertaking the action shall fully fund and conduct necessary restoration and/or mitigation for any impacts to the critical area and buffers resulting from the emergency action in accordance with an approved critical area report and mitigation plan. The person or agency undertaking the action shall apply for review, and the alteration, critical area report, and mitigation plan shall be reviewed by the city in accordance with the review procedures contained herein. Restoration and/or mitigation activities must be initiated within one year of the date of the emergency, and completed in a timely manner;

(2) Operation, Maintenance, or Repair. Operation, maintenance, or repair of existing structures, infrastructure improvements, utilities, public or private roads, dikes, levees, or drainage systems, that do not require construction permits, if the activity does not further alter or increase the impact to, or encroach further within, the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed operation, maintenance, or repair. Operation and maintenance includes vegetation management performed in accordance with best management practices that is part of ongoing maintenance of structures, infrastructure, or utilities; provided, that such management actions are part of regular and ongoing maintenance, do not expand further into the critical area, are not the result of an expansion of the structure or utility, and do not directly impact an endangered or threatened species;

(3) Passive Outdoor Activities. Recreation, education, and scientific research activities that do not degrade the critical area, including fishing, hiking, and bird watching. Trails must be constructed pursuant to the public and private pedestrian trails standards specified in FMC 22.92.110(c)(5);

(4) Forest Practices. Forest practices regulated and conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 76.09 RCW and forest practices regulations, WAC Title 222;

(5) Construction within Previously Approved Planned Developments. Construction or reconstruction of a single-family, duplex or condominium unit on a lot that was platted or approved within a planned development subsequent to the city’s adoption of interim critical areas regulations in 1993 and prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, provided such unit is constructed in accordance with all applicable critical areas regulations in effect at the time of platting or approval; and

(6) Structural Modification of, Additions to, or Replacement of, Existing Residential Structures. Structural modification of, additions to, or replacement of, existing principal residential structures lawfully established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter that do not meet the critical area buffer or building setback requirements; provided, that:

(A) The structure is located within a wetland buffer, fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffer, or associated buffer building setback;

(B) The structure is not located within a frequently flooded area, geologically hazardous area buffer, or associated buffer building setback;

(C) The modification, addition, replacement or related activity will not increase impervious surface by more than 500 square feet, in total, on the site;

(D) There is no other practicable location within the site that will accommodate the activity, meet the buffer and building setback requirements, and satisfy all other requirements of this title; and

(E) For lots adjoining Leach Creek or Ross Creek, the proposed activity will not encroach into the required buffer beyond that of the existing principal residential structure, and any increase in impervious surface will be compensated for by the planting of native plants within the buffer at a 1:1 ratio of native planting area to increased impervious surface area (i.e., 100 square feet of native planting area would need to be installed in the buffer for 100 square feet of new impervious surface). (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).

The director or his/her designee shall review the critical area identification form, conduct a site inspection, and review other information available pertaining to the site and the proposal and make a determination as to whether any critical areas may be affected by the proposal and if a more detailed critical area report shall be submitted.

(1) Decision Indicators. The director may use the following indicators to assist in determining the need for a critical area report:

(A) Indication of a critical area on the city critical areas maps that may be impacted by the proposed activity;

(B) Information and scientific opinions from appropriate agencies, including but not limited to the Departments of Fish and Wildlife, Natural Resources, and Ecology;

(C) Documentation, from a scientific or other reasonable source, of the possible presence of a critical area; or

(D) A finding by a qualified professional or a reasonable belief by the director that a critical area may exist on or adjacent to the site of the proposed activity.

(d) Decision on Identification Form.

(1) No Critical Areas Present. If after a site visit the director’s analysis indicates that the project area is not within or adjacent to a critical area or buffer and that the proposed activity is unlikely to degrade the functions or values of a critical area, then the director shall rule that the critical area review is complete and note on the identification form the reasons that no further review is required. A summary of this information shall be included in any staff report or decision on the underlying permit.

(2) Critical Areas Present, But No Impact – Waiver. If the director determines that there are critical areas within or adjacent to the project area, but that the best available science shows that the proposed activity is unlikely to degrade the functions or values of the critical area, the director may waive the requirement for a critical area report. A waiver may be granted if there is substantial evidence that all of the following requirements will be met:

(A) There will be no alteration of the critical area or buffer;

(B) The development proposal will not impact the critical area in a manner contrary to the purpose, intent, and requirements of the applicable critical areas chapter(s); and

(C) The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.

A summary of this analysis and the findings shall be included in any staff report or decision on the underlying permit.

(3) Critical Areas May Be Affected by Proposal. If the director determines that a critical area or areas may be affected by the proposal, then the director shall notify the applicant that a critical area report must be submitted prior to further review of the project, and indicate each of the critical area types that should be addressed in the report.

(e) Director’s Determination Subject to Reconsideration. A determination regarding the apparent absence of one or more critical areas by the director is not an expert certification regarding the presence of critical areas and the determination is subject to possible reconsideration and reopening if new information is received.

If the applicant wants greater assurance of the accuracy of the critical area review determination, the applicant may choose to hire a qualified professional to provide such assurances. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).


22.92.150 Public notice of initial determination.

The city shall notify the public of proposals in accordance with Chapter 22.07 FMC.

(a) If the director determines that no critical area report is necessary, the city shall state the reasons for this determination in the notice of application issued by the city for the proposal.

(b) If the director determines that there are critical areas on the site that the proposed project is unlikely to impact and the project meets the requirements for and has been granted a waiver from the requirement to complete a critical area report, a summary of the analysis and findings for this decision shall be stated in the notice of application for the proposal.

(c) If the director determines that critical areas may be affected by the proposal and a critical area report is required, public notice of the application shall include a description of the critical area that might be affected and state that a critical area report is required. (Ord. 1375 § 1, 2005).

22.93.010 Designating, defining, identifying, and mapping wetlands.

(a) Designating, Defining and Identifying Wetlands. Wetlands are those areas designated in accordance with the procedures outlined in WAC 173-22-035.

All areas within the city meeting the wetland definition criteria, regardless of whether these areas have previously been identified or mapped, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter.

(b) Mapping. The approximate location and extent of wetlands are shown on the adopted critical area map contained within the comprehensive plan. In addition, the maps contained within the National Wetlands Inventory are hereby adopted. Additionally, soil maps produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Resources Conservation Service may be useful in helping to identify potential wetland areas. These maps are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants, and/or property owners, and may be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified.

It is the actual presence of a wetland on a parcel, as delineated by WAC 173-22-035, which triggers the requirements of Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter, whether or not the wetland is identified on the adopted maps. The exact location of a wetland’s boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field delineation by a qualified wetlands professional in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements pursuant to WAC 173-22-035. (Ord. 1512 § 6, 2011; Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.020 Regulated activities.

The following activities are regulated if they occur in a regulated wetland or its buffer:

(a) The removal, excavation, grading, or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, minerals, organic matter, or material of any kind;

(b) The dumping, discharging, or filling with any material;

(c) The draining, flooding, or disturbing of the water level or water table;

(d) The driving of pilings;

(e) The placing of obstructions;

(f) The construction, reconstruction, demolition, or expansion of any structure;

(g) The destruction or alteration of wetland vegetation through clearing, harvesting, shading, intentional burning, or planting of vegetation that would alter the character of a regulated wetland; provided, that these activities are not part of a forest practice governed under Chapter 76.09 RCW and its rules; or

(h) Activities that result in:

(1) A significant change of water temperature;

(2) A significant change of physical or chemical characteristics of the sources of water to the wetland;

(3) A significant change in the quantity, timing or duration of the water entering the wetland; or

(4) The introduction of pollutants. (Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.030 Activities allowed in wetlands.

The activities listed below are allowed in wetlands in addition to those activities listed in, and consistent with, the provisions established in FMC 22.92.110. These activities do not require submission of a critical area report, except where such activities result in a loss to the functions and values of a wetland or wetland buffer. These activities include:

(a) Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing wetland.

(b) The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops, and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

(c) Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a wetland with the entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column will be disturbed.

(d) Enhancement of a wetland through the removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and disposed of appropriately. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to the species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.

(e) Educational and scientific research activities.

(f) Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facilities within an existing right-of-way; provided, that the maintenance or repair does not increase the footprint or use of the facility or right-of-way. (Ord. 1574 § 3, 2016; Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.040 Wetland ratings.

(a) Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Department of Ecology Wetland Rating System for Western Washington – 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-030) or as revised by Ecology. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists at the time of the adoption of this chapter or as it exists at the time of an associated permit application. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications.

(b) Wetland Rating Categories.

(1) Category I. Category I wetlands are: (A) wetlands that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR as high quality wetland; (B) bogs; (C) mature and old growth forested wetlands larger than one acre; and (D) wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring between 23 and 27 points).

These wetlands are those that: (A) represent unique or rare wetland types; or (B) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or (C) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or (D) provide a high level of functions.

(2) Category II. Category II wetlands are wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (score between 20 and 22 points).

(3) Category III. Category III wetlands are those wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19). Wetlands scoring between 16 and 19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways, and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.

(4) Category IV. Category IV wetlands are those wetlands with the lowest levels of functions (between nine and 15 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that are possible to replace, and in some cases improve. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree. (Ord. 1574 § 4, 2016; Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.050 Standards – General requirements.

(a) Activities and uses shall be prohibited in wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter.

(b) Category I Wetlands. Activities and uses shall be prohibited from Category I wetlands, except as provided for in the public agency and utility exception, reasonable use exception, and variance sections of Chapter 22.92 FMC.

(c) Category II and III Wetlands. For activities proposed in Category II and III wetlands, the following standards shall apply:

Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of wetland and buffers shall be provided under the terms established under FMC 22.93.070.

(d) Category IV Wetlands. Activities and uses that result in unavoidable impacts may be permitted in Category IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area report and compensatory mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives. Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of wetlands and buffers shall be provided under the terms established under FMC 22.93.070. (Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).

When appropriate, the director may also require the critical area report to include an evaluation by the state Department of Ecology or an independent qualified expert regarding the applicant’s analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, and to include any recommendations as appropriate.

(1) If the development proposal site contains or is within a wetland area, the applicant shall submit an affidavit, which declares whether the applicant has knowledge of any illegal alteration to any or all wetlands on the proposed site and whether the applicant previously had been found in violation of this title. If the applicant has been found previously in violation, the applicant shall declare whether such violation has been corrected to the satisfaction of the jurisdiction.

(2) The director shall determine if the mitigation and monitoring plans and bonding measures proposed by the applicant are sufficient to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, consistent with the goals, purposes, objectives and requirements of Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter. (Ord. 1574 § 5, 2016; Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.070 Compensatory mitigation requirements.

(a) Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State, Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans – Version 1 (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, Olympia, WA, March 2006 or as revised), and Selected Wetland Mitigation Sites using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Publication No. 09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009).

(b) Mitigation shall be required in the following order of preference:

(1) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

(2) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts.

(3) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment.

(4) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations.

(5) Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments.

(6) Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures.

(c) Compensation for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when either:

(1) The lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific function assessment, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

(2) Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

(d) Preference of Mitigation Actions. Methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions shall be approached in the following order of preference:

(1) Restoration (reestablishment and rehabilitation) of wetlands.

(2) Creation (establishment) of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species. This should only be attempted when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is anticipated in the design.

(3) Enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation. Such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

(e) Type and Location of Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in-kind and on-site, or in-kind and within the same stream reach or subbasin. Mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the same site as the alteration except when all of the following apply:

(1) There are no reasonable on-site or in-subdrainage basin opportunities (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high functioning upland habitat), or on-site and in-subdrainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the natural capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Consideration should include: anticipated wetland mitigation replacement ratios, buffer conditions and proposed widths, available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity);

(2) Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland; and

(3) Off-site locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless:

(A) Established watershed goals for water quality, flood or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or

(B) Credits from a state certified wetland mitigation bank are used as mitigation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the bank’s certification.

(f) Timing of Compensatory Mitigation. It is preferred that compensation projects be completed prior to activities that will disturb the on-site wetlands. At the least, compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora.

The director may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (for example, project delay lapses past a fisheries window; or plan installation should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survivability of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the city.

(g) Mitigation Ratios.

(1) Acreage Replacement Ratios. The following ratios in Table 22.93.A shall apply to creation or restoration, rehabilitation, reestablishment or creation and enhancement, or enhancement only, that is in-kind, is on-site, is the same category, is timed prior to or concurrent with alteration, and has a high probability of success. These ratios do not apply to remedial actions resulting from unauthorized alterations; greater ratios shall apply in those cases. These ratios do not apply to the use of credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank. When credits from a certified bank are used, replacement ratios should be consistent with the requirements of the bank’s certification. The first number specifies the acreage of replacement wetlands and the second specifies the acreage of wetlands altered.

Table 22.93.A Mitigation Ratios  

	Category and Type of Wetland	Reestablishment or Creation	Rehabilitation**	1:1 Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E)	Enhancement Only

	All Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	6:1

	All Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	8:1

	All Category II	3:1	8:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	12:1

	Category I Forested	6:1	12:1	1:1 R/C and 10:1 E	24:1

	Category I based on score for functions	4:1	8:1	1:1 R/C and 6:1 E	16:1

	Category I Natural Heritage site	Not considered possible*	6:1 rehabilitation of a Natural Heritage site	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

	Category I Bog	Not considered possible*	6:1 rehabilitation of a bog	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

*    Natural Heritage sites and bogs are considered irreplaceable wetlands, and therefore no amount of compensation would replace these ecosystems. Avoidance is the best option. In the rare cases when impacts cannot be avoided, replacement ratios will be assigned on a case-by-case basis. However, these ratios will be significantly higher than the other ratios for Category I wetlands.

**    Rehabilitation ratios are based on the assumption that actions judged to be most effective for that site are being implemented.

(2) Increased Replacement Ratio. The director may increase the ratios under the following circumstances:

(A) Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation; or

(B) A significant period of time will elapse between impact and establishment of wetland functions at the mitigation site; or

(C) Proposed mitigation will result in a lower category wetland or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted; or

(D) The impact was an unauthorized impact.

(3) Reduced Replacement Ratio. The director may reduce the ratios under the following circumstances:

(A) Documentation by a qualified wetland specialist demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions have a very high likelihood of success based on prior experience; or

(B) Documentation by a qualified wetland specialist demonstrates that the proposed actions for compensation will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the wetland being impacted; or

(C) The proposed actions for compensation are conducted in advance of the impact and are shown to be successful; or

(D) In wetlands where several HGM classes are found within one delineated boundary, the ratios can be decreased if:

(i) Impacts to the wetland are all within an area that has a different HGM class from the one used to establish the category; and

(ii) The category of this area with a different class is “lower” than that of the entire wetland; and

(iii) The proponents provide adequate hydrologic and geomorphic data to establish that the boundary between the HGM classes lies outside of the footprint of the impacts.

(h) Preservation. Impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by preservation of wetland areas when used in combination with other forms of mitigation such as creation, restoration, or enhancement at the preservation site or at a separate location. Preservation may also be used by itself, but more restrictions apply as outlined below.

(1) Preservation in Combination with Other Forms of Compensation. Using preservation as compensation is acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by restoration or creation and the criteria below are met:

(A) The impact area is small, and/or impacts are to a Category III or IV wetland;

(B) Preservation of a high quality system occurs in the same water resource inventory area (WRIA) or watershed basin where the wetland impact occurs;

(C) Preservation sites include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation; and

(D) Mitigation ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation shall range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being mitigated and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.

(2) Preservation as the Sole Means of Compensation for Wetland Impacts. Preservation of at-risk, high quality habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when all of the following criteria are met:

(A) Preservation is used as a form of compensation only after the standard sequencing of mitigation (avoid, minimize, and then compensate) has been applied;

(B) Creation, restoration, and enhancement opportunities have also been considered, and preservation is the best mitigation option;

(C) The impact area is small, and/or impacts are to a Category III or IV wetland;

(D) Preservation of a high quality system occurs in the same water resource inventory area (WRIA) or watershed basin where the wetland impact occurs;

(E) Preservation sites include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation;

(F) The preservation site is determined to be under imminent threat, specifically, sites with the potential to experience a high rate of undesirable ecological change due to on-site or off-site activities. “Potential” includes permitted, planned, or likely actions that are not adequately protected under existing regulations (e.g., logging of forested wetlands); and

(G) The area proposed for preservation is of high quality and critical for the health of the watershed or basin. Some of the following features may be indicative of high quality sites:

(i) Category I or II wetland rating;

(ii) Rare wetland type (e.g., bogs and mature forested wetlands);

(iii) Habitat for threatened or endangered species;

(iv) Wetland type that is rare in the area;

(v) Provides biological and/or hydrological connectivity;

(vi) High regional or watershed importance (e.g., listed as priority site in watershed plan); and

(vii) Large size with high species diversity (plants and/or animals) and/or high abundance.

(H) Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20:1. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost.

(i) Wetland Mitigation Banks.

(1) Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:

(A) The bank is certified under state rules;

(B) The director determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

(C) The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the certified bank instrument.

(2) Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the certified bank instrument.

(3) Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, bank service areas may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions.

(j) Credit/Debit Method. To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the joint guidance “Wetland Mitigation in Washington State Parts I and II” (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a-b, Olympia, WA, March, 2006), the director may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in “Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report,” (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised).

(k) In-Lieu Fee. To aid in the implementation of off-site mitigation, the city may develop an in-lieu fee program. This program shall be developed and approved through a public process and be consistent with federal rules, state policy on in-lieu fee mitigation, and state water quality regulations. An approved in-lieu fee program sells compensatory mitigation credits to permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then transferred to the in-lieu program sponsor, a governmental or nonprofit natural resource management entity. Credits from an approved in-lieu fee program may be used when subsections (k)(1) through (6) of this section apply:

(1) The approval authority determines that it would provide environmentally appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts.

(2) The mitigation will occur on a site identified using the site selection and prioritization process in the approved in-lieu fee program instrument.

(3) The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the approved in-lieu fee program instrument.

(4) Land acquisition and initial physical and biological improvements of the mitigation site must be completed within three years of the credit sale.

(5) Projects using in-lieu fee credits shall have debits associated with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant’s qualified wetland scientist using the method consistent with the credit assessment method specified in the approved instrument for the in-lieu fee program.

(6) Credits from an approved in-lieu fee program may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the approved in-lieu fee instrument.

(l) Advance Mitigation. Mitigation for projects with pre-identified impacts to wetlands may be constructed in advance of the impacts if the mitigation is implemented according to federal rules, state policy on advance mitigation, and state water quality regulations.

(m) Alternative Mitigation Plans. The director may approve alternative critical areas mitigation plans that are based on best available science. Alternative mitigation proposals must provide an equivalent or better level of protection of critical area functions and values than would be provided by the strict application of this chapter.

The director shall consider the following for approval of an alternative mitigation proposal:

(1) The proposal uses a watershed approach consistent with Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Ecology Publication No. 09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009).

(2) Creation or enhancement of a larger system of natural areas and open space is preferable to the preservation of many individual habitat areas.

(3) Mitigation according to subsection (e) of this section is not feasible due to site constraints such as parcel size, stream type, wetland category, or geologic hazards.

(4) There is clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the proposed mitigation site.

(5) The plan shall contain clear and measurable standards for achieving compliance with the specific provisions of the plan. A monitoring plan shall, at a minimum, meet the provisions in FMC 22.93.060(d).

(6) The plan shall be reviewed and approved as part of overall approval of the proposed use.

(7) A wetland of a different type is justified based on regional needs or functions and values; the replacement ratios may not be reduced or eliminated unless the reduction results in a preferred environmental alternative.

(8) Mitigation guarantees shall meet the minimum requirements as outlined in FMC 22.93.060(d)(2)(A)(viii).

(9) Qualified professionals in each of the critical areas addressed shall prepare the plan.

(10) The city may consult with agencies with expertise and jurisdiction over the resources during the review to assist with analysis and identification of appropriate performance measures that adequately safeguard critical areas. (Ord. 1574 § 6, 2016; Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.080 Standards – Subdivisions.

The subdivision and short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers is subject to the following:

(a) Land that is located wholly within a wetland or its buffer may not be subdivided.

(b) Land that is located partially within a wetland or its buffer may be subdivided; provided, that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot is located outside of the wetland and its buffer.

(c) Access roads and utilities serving the proposed subdivision may be permitted within the wetland and associated buffers only if the city determines that no other feasible alternative exists and when consistent with Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter. (Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.090 Signs and fencing of wetlands.

(a) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland buffer and the clearing limits identified by an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field with temporary “clearing limits” fencing in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur. The marking is subject to inspection by the director prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

(b) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer.

(1) Permanent signs shall be made of an enamel-coated metal face and attached to a metal post, or another nontreated material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:

Protected Wetland Area Do Not Disturb Contact City of Fircrest Regarding Uses, Restrictions, and Opportunities for Stewardship

(2) The provisions of subsection (b)(1) of this section may be modified as necessary to assure protection of sensitive features or wildlife.

(c) Fencing.

(1) The director shall determine if fencing is necessary to protect the functions and values of the critical area. If found to be necessary, the director shall condition any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter to require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the wetland.

(2) The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on site.

(3) Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. (Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.100 Wetland buffers.

(a) Buffer Requirements. The standard buffer widths in Table 22.93.B, below, have been established in accordance with the best available science. They are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State wetland rating system for western Washington.

(1) The use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the measures in Table 22.93.C, below, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses.

(2) If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 22.93.C, then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required. For example, a 75-foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100-foot buffer without them.

(3) The standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

(4) Additional buffer widths are added to the standard buffer widths. For example, a Category I wetland scoring 32 points for habitat function would require a buffer of 225 feet (75 plus 150).

Table 22.93.B Wetland Buffer Requirements for Western Washington 

	Wetland Category	Buffer width (in feet) based on habitat score

	 	3 – 4 (Low)	5 (Medium Low)	6 – 7 (Medium High)	8 – 9 (High)

	Category I: Based on total score	75	105	165	225

	Category I: Bogs and Wetlands of High Conservation Value	190	225

	Category I: Forested	75	105	165	225

	Category II: Based on score	75	105	165	225

	Category III (all)	60	105	165	225

	Category IV (all)	40

 

Table 22.93.C Required Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands  

	Disturbance	Required Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	• Direct lights away from wetland

	Noise	• Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland

	• If warranted, enhance existing buffer with native vegetation plantings adjacent to noise source

	• For activities that generate relatively continuous, potentially disruptive noise, such as certain heavy industry or mining, establish an additional 10-foot, heavily vegetated buffer strip immediately adjacent to the outer wetland buffer

	Toxic runoff	• Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered

	• Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 feet of wetland

	• Apply integrated pest management

	Stormwater runoff	• Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development

	• Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer

	• Use low intensity development techniques (per PSAT publication on LID techniques)

	Change in water regime	• Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns

	Pets and human disturbance	• Use privacy fencing or plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion

	• Place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract or protect with a conservation easement

	Dust	• Use best management practices to control dust

	Disruption of corridors or connections	• Maintain connections to offsite areas that are undisturbed

	• Restore corridors or connections to offsite habitats by replanting

(b) Conditions for Increasing Buffer Widths or Enhancing Buffers.

(1) Buffer is not vegetated with plants appropriate for the region. The recommended widths for buffers are based on the assumption that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion or with one that performs similar functions. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with nonnative species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions in the buffer are provided. Generally, improving the vegetation will be more effective than widening the buffer.

(2) Buffer has a steep slope. The effectiveness of buffers at removing pollutants before they enter a wetland decreases as the slope increases. If the buffer for a wetland is to be based on the score for its ability to improve water quality rather than habitat or other criteria, then the buffer should be increased by 50 percent if the slope is greater than 30 percent.

(3) Buffer is used by sensitive species. If the wetland provides habitat for a particularly sensitive species (such as a threatened or endangered species), the buffer width should be increased to provide adequate protection for the species based on its particular life history needs. Buffer requirements for certain priority species may be obtained from the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

(c) Buffer Averaging. The widths of buffers may be averaged if this will improve the protection of wetland functions, or if it is the only way to allow for reasonable use of a parcel. 

(1) Averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

(A) The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a “dual-rated” wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower rated area; and

(B) The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher-functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower functioning or less sensitive portion; and

(C) The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

(D) The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than 75 percent of the standard width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III, and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.

(2) Averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

(A) There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging; and

(B) The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a report from a qualified wetland expert; and

(C) The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

(D) The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than 75 percent of the standard width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III, and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.

(d) Buffers on Mitigation Sites. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter and based on expected or target category of the proposed wetland mitigation site.

(e) Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed or enhanced condition. Removal of invasive nonnative weeds is required for the duration of the mitigation bond.

(f) Buffer Uses. The following uses may be permitted within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter, provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:

(1) Conservation and restoration activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife.

(2) Passive recreation. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical area report, including:

(A) Walkways and trails; provided, that those pathways are limited to minor crossings that have no adverse impact on water quality. They should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland located only in the outer 25 percent of the buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. They should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width for pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings area may be acceptable; and

(B) Wildlife viewing structures.

(3) Educational and scientific research activities.

(4) Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facilities within an existing right-of-way; provided, that the maintenance or repair does not increase the footprint or use of the facility or right-of-way.

(5) The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops, and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

(6) Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a buffer with the entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer boundary; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column will be disturbed.

(7) Enhancement of a wetland buffer through the removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to the species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.

(8) Stormwater management facilities. Stormwater management facilities are limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales. They may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only; provided, that:

(A) No other location is feasible;

(B) The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland; and

(C) Stormwater management facilities are not allowed in buffers of Category I or II wetlands.

(9) Nonconforming uses. Repair and maintenance of nonconforming uses or structures, where legally established within the buffer, provided they do not increase the degree of nonconformity. (Ord. 1574 § 7, 2016; Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.110 Residential density and on-site density transfer.

The purpose of on-site density transfer is to cluster development in a manner that provides protection for wetlands and allows transfer of residential density from a wetland and/or wetland buffer to an area on the same site that is neither wetland nor buffer. A request for on-site density transfer shall be considered pursuant to the planned development review process in Chapter 22.76 FMC.

Those portions of the wetland and/or wetland buffer in which regulated activities are proposed to occur shall not be considered in calculating density transfer. Density transfer shall be determined as follows:

(a) For sites containing regulated wetland buffer areas, full density credit may be transferred from the buffer area to the nonbuffer area.

(b) For sites containing regulated wetland areas, density transfer shall be calculated from the following table.

On-Site Density Transfer 

	Percentage of site in wetland	Amount of credit

	0 – 25%	75%

	26 – 50%	50%

	51 – 100%	25% 

(Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.120 Stormwater management impacts to wetlands.

Repealed by Ord. 1574. (Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).


22.93.130 Alternate review process – Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 individual permits.

When an Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permit is required for a project involving wetlands, the Army Corps permitting process may be substituted for the city permitting process. If a proposal reviewed and conditioned by the Corps satisfies the intent of this chapter, no further wetland review shall be required by the city. If a proposal reviewed and conditioned by the Corps does not satisfy the intent of this chapter, then a critical areas report shall be prepared in accordance with FMC 22.93.030, and modifications made to the project if warranted, in order to demonstrate compliance with this chapter. All permits and approvals required by other city development regulations shall be required. (Ord. 1375 § 2, 2005).

22.97.010 Designation of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas.

(a) Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas include:

(1) Areas with which State or Federally Designated Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Species Have a Primary Association.

(A) Federally designated endangered and threatened species are those fish and wildlife species identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service that are in danger of extinction or threatened to become endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service should be consulted for current listing status.

(B) State-designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are those fish and wildlife species native to the state of Washington, identified by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, that are in danger of extinction, threatened to become endangered, vulnerable, or declining and are likely to become endangered or threatened in a significant portion of their range within the state without cooperative management or removal of threats. State-designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are periodically recorded in WAC 232-12-014 (state endangered species) and WAC 232-12-011 (state threatened and sensitive species). The state Department of Fish and Wildlife maintains the most current listing and should be consulted for current listing status.

(2) State Priority Habitats and Areas Associated with State Priority Species. Priority habitats and species are considered to be priorities for conservation and management. Priority species require protective measures for their perpetuation due to their population status, sensitivity to habitat alteration, and/or recreational, commercial, or tribal importance. Priority habitats are those habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species. A priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type or dominant plant species, a described successional stage, or a specific structural element. Priority habitats and species are identified by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.

(3) Habitats and Species of Local Importance. Habitats and species of local importance are those identified by the city, including but not limited to those habitats and species that, due to their population status or sensitivity to habitat manipulation, warrant protection. Habitats may include a seasonal range or habitat element with which a species has a primary association, and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term.

(4) Naturally Occurring Ponds Under 20 Acres. Naturally occurring ponds are those ponds under 20 acres and their submerged aquatic beds that provide fish or wildlife habitat, including those artificial ponds intentionally created from dry areas in order to mitigate impacts to ponds. Naturally occurring ponds do not include ponds deliberately designed and created from dry sites, such as canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, temporary construction ponds, and landscape amenities, unless such artificial ponds were intentionally created for mitigation.

(5) Waters of the State. Waters of the state include lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington, as classified in WAC 222-16-031 (or WAC 222-16-030 depending on classification used).

(6) Lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers planted with game fish by a governmental entity.

(7) State Natural Area Preserves and Natural Resource Conservation Areas. Natural area preserves and natural resource conservation areas are defined, established, and managed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources.

(8) Areas of Rare Plant Species and High Quality Ecosystems. Areas of rare plant species and high quality ecosystems are identified by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources through the Natural Heritage Program.

(9) Land useful or essential for preserving connections between habitat blocks and open spaces.

(b) All areas within the city meeting one or more of these criteria, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of Chapter 22.92 FMC and this chapter and shall be managed consistent with the best available science, such as the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Management Recommendations for Priority Habitat and Species.

(c) Mapping. The approximate location and extent of habitat conservation areas are shown on the adopted critical area map contained within the comprehensive plan. In addition, the following maps are hereby adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter:

(1) Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife Priority Habitat and Species maps;

(2) Washington State Department of Natural Resources, Official Water Type Reference maps, as amended;

(3) Washington State Department of Natural Resources Natural Heritage Program mapping data;

(4) Anadromous and resident salmonid distribution maps contained in the Habitat Limiting Factors reports published by the Washington Conservation Commission; and

(5) Washington State Department of Natural Resources State Natural Area Preserves and Natural Resource Conservation Area maps.

These maps are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants, and/or property owners and should be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified. They are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation. (Ord. 1375 § 6, 2005).

22.99.010 Designation of frequently flooded areas.

(a) Frequently Flooded Areas. Frequently flooded areas shall include:

(1) Areas Identified on the Flood Insurance Map(s). The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Pierce County, and Incorporated Areas” dated March 7, 2017, and any revisions thereto, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study and the FIRM are on file at City Hall, 115 Ramsdell Street, Fircrest WA.

(2) Areas Identified by the Director. Those areas of special flood hazard identified by the director, or his or her designee, based on review of base flood elevation and floodway data available from federal, state, city, or other valid sources when base flood elevation data has not been provided from the Federal Insurance Administration [“A” zone of the flood insurance map(s)].

(b) Use of Additional Information. The director may use additional flood information that is more restrictive or detailed than that provided in the flood insurance study conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to designate frequently flooded areas, including data on channel migration, historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, location of restrictive floodways, maps showing future build-out conditions, maps that show riparian habitat areas, or similar information.

(c) Flood Elevation Data. When base flood elevation data is not available (“A” zones), the director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer this chapter.

(d) Designation Made by Director. The flood insurance maps are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants and/or property owners and the public and should be considered a minimum designation of frequently flooded areas. As flood insurance maps may be continuously updated as areas are reexamined or new areas are identified, newer and more restrictive information for flood hazard area identification shall be the basis for regulation.

(e) Maintenance of Records. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study or required through subsection (c) of this section, the director shall obtain and record the as-built elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. The director shall also maintain for public inspection all records of floodplain hazards, certificates of floodproofing, and flood elevation data. (Ord. 1596 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1375 § 4, 2005).


22.99.020 Critical area report – Additional requirements.

22.99.030 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. The provisions of this chapter do not imply that land outside frequently flooded areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These provisions shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 1375 § 4, 2005).


22.99.040 Performance standards – General requirements.

The following standards shall be adhered to in all frequently flooded areas, except as otherwise provided for in this chapter:

(a) Development Permit. A development permit shall be obtained before land is altered or a new use is commenced within a frequently flooded area. For application of this chapter, development shall include any manmade alteration to land, including but not limited to buildings, structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials within the area of special flood hazard.

(b) All Other Necessary Permits. The director shall verify that all necessary permits have been obtained from those governmental agencies from which prior approval is required by federal, state, or local law including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

(c) Before Regulatory Floodway. In areas where the base flood elevation is provided, but where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, including fill, shall not be permitted within zones A1 – 30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

(d) Areas Without Base Flood Elevation Data. Where base flood elevation data is not available (“A” zones) and there is insufficient data available from federal, state, or other sources, the director shall determine the base flood elevation using approved engineering methods and historical data, such as high water marks, photographs of past flooding, and other available information. If there is insufficient data available for the director to make a determination of the base flood elevation and standards requiring a base flood elevation cannot be implemented, the director shall require measures that ensure the proposed structures will be reasonably safe from flooding. At a minimum, the base flood elevation should be set at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade to avoid higher flood insurance rates.

(e) Construction Materials and Methods.

(1) Structures Shall Be Located Outside the Floodplain. All structures, utilities, and other improvements shall be located on the buildable portion of the site out of the floodplain unless there is no buildable site area out of the floodplain. For sites with no buildable area out of the floodplain, structures, utilities, and other improvements shall be placed on the highest land on the site, oriented parallel to flow rather than perpendicular, and sited as far from the watercourse and other critical areas as possible. However, in no case shall stormwater treatment or flow control facilities be allowed within the floodplain. If the director detects any evidence of active hyporheic exchange on a site, the development shall be located to minimize disruption of such exchange.

(2) Methods That Minimize Flood Damage. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using flood-resistant materials and using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

(3) Utility Protection. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

(f) Elevation Certificate Following Construction. Following construction of a structure within the floodplain where the base flood elevation is provided, the applicant shall obtain an elevation certificate that records the elevation of the lowest floor. The elevation certificate shall be completed by a surveyor or engineer licensed in the state of Washington and shall be submitted to the city for recording.

(g) Anchoring.

(1) Anchoring Requirement. All new construction and substantial improvements within the floodplain shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.

(2) Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes placed within the floodplain must be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.

(h) Fill and Grading. Fill and grading within the floodplain shall only occur on a determination from a qualified professional that the fill or grading will not block side channels, inhibit channel migration, increase flood hazards to others, or be placed within a channel migration zone, whether or not the city has delineated such zones as of the time of the application. (Ord. 1375 § 4, 2005).

Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as geologically hazardous areas:

(a) Erosion hazard; and

(b) Landslide hazard. (Ord. 1375 § 5, 2005).


22.100.020 Designation of specific hazard areas.

(a) Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are at least those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “moderate to severe,” “severe,” or “very severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard. Erosion hazard areas are also those areas impacted by shoreland and/or stream bank erosion and those areas within a river’s channel migration zone.

(b) Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Examples of these may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Areas of historic failures, such as:

(A) Those areas delineated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “severe” limitation for building site development;

(B) Those areas mapped by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable (U or class 3), unstable old slides (UOS or class 4), or unstable recent slides (URS or class 5); or

(C) Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Washington State Department of Natural Resources;

(2) Areas with all three of the following characteristics:

(A) Slopes steeper than 15 percent;

(B) Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and

(C) Springs or ground water seepage.

(3) Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to the present) or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch;

(4) Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials;

(5) Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action;

(6) Any area with a slope of 40 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and is measured by averaging the inclination over at least 10 feet of vertical relief. (Ord. 1375 § 5, 2005).


22.100.030 Classification of geologically hazardous areas.

All geologic hazard areas should be classified according to the following categories for each geologic hazard type:

	Classification	Documentation and Data Sources

	Known or Suspected Risk	Documentation or projection of the hazard by a qualified professional exists.

	Risk Unknown	Documentation or projection of the lack of hazard by a qualified professional exists, or data are not available to determine the presence or absence of a geologic hazard.

(Ord. 1375 § 5, 2005).


22.100.040 Mapping of geologically hazardous areas.

(a) The approximate location and extent of geologically hazardous areas are shown on the adopted critical area map contained within the comprehensive plan. In addition, the following maps are hereby adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter:

(1) U.S. Geological Survey landslide hazard and seismic hazard maps;

(2) Washington State Department of Natural Resources seismic hazard maps for Western Washington;

(3) Washington State Department of Natural Resources slope stability maps; and

(4) Federal Emergency Management Administration flood insurance maps.

(b) These maps are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants and/or property owners and may be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified. They are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation. (Ord. 1375 § 5, 2005).


22.100.050 Activities allowed in geologically hazardous areas.

The following activities are allowed in geologically hazardous areas pursuant to FMC 22.92.110 and do not require submission of a critical area report:

22.100.090 Performance standards – Erosion and landslide hazard areas.

Activities on sites containing erosion or landslide hazards shall meet the standards of FMC 22.100.080 and the specific following requirements:

(a) Buffer Requirement. A buffer shall be established from all edges of landslide hazard areas. The size of the buffer shall be determined by the director to eliminate or minimize the risk of property damage, death, or injury resulting from landslides caused in whole or part by the development, based upon review of and concurrence with a critical area report prepared by a qualified professional.

(1) Minimum Buffer. The minimum buffer shall be equal to the height of the slope or 50 feet, whichever is greater.

(2) Buffer Reduction. The buffer may be reduced to a minimum of 10 feet when a qualified professional demonstrates to the director’s satisfaction that the reduction will adequately protect the proposed development, adjacent developments, and uses and the subject critical area.

(3) Increased Buffer. The buffer may be increased where the director determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed and existing development;

(b) Alterations. Alterations of an erosion or landslide hazard area and/or buffer may only occur for activities for which a hazards analysis is submitted and certifies that:

(1) The development will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions;

(2) The development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent properties; and

(3) Such alterations will not adversely impact other critical areas;

(c) Design Standards. Development within an erosion or landslide hazard area and/or buffer shall be designed to meet the following basic requirements unless it can be demonstrated that an alternative design that deviates from one or more of these standards provides greater long-term slope stability while meeting all other provisions of the applicable critical areas chapters. The requirement for long-term slope stability shall exclude designs that require regular and periodic maintenance to maintain their level of function. The basic development design standards are:

(1) The proposed development shall not decrease the factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 1.5 for static conditions and 1.2 for dynamic conditions. Analysis of dynamic conditions shall be based on a minimum horizontal acceleration as established by the current version of the International Building Code;

(2) Structures and improvements shall be clustered to avoid geologically hazardous areas and other critical areas;

(3) Structures and improvements shall minimize alterations to the natural contour of the slope, and foundations shall be tiered where possible to conform to existing topography;

(4) Structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation;

(5) The proposed development shall not result in greater risk or a need for increased buffers on neighboring properties;

(6) The use of retaining walls that allow the maintenance of existing natural slope area is preferred over graded artificial slopes; and

(7) Development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage;

(d) Vegetation Retention. Unless otherwise provided or as part of an approved alteration, removal of vegetation from an erosion or landslide hazard area or related buffer shall be prohibited;

(e) Seasonal Restriction. Clearing shall be allowed only from May 1st to October 1st of each year; provided, that the city may extend or shorten the dry season on a case-by-case basis depending on actual weather conditions, except that timber harvest, not including brush clearing or stump removal, may be allowed pursuant to an approved forest practice permit issued by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources;

(f) Utility Lines and Pipes. Utility lines and pipes shall be permitted in erosion and landslide hazard areas only when the applicant demonstrates that no other practical alternative is available. The line or pipe shall be located aboveground and properly anchored and/or designed so that it will continue to function in the event of an underlying slide. Stormwater conveyance shall be allowed only through a high-density polyethylene pipe with fuse-welded joints, or similar product that is technically equal or superior;

(g) Point Discharges. Point discharges from surface water facilities and roof drains onto or upstream from an erosion or landslide hazard area shall be prohibited except as follows:

(1) Conveyed via continuous storm pipe downslope to a point where there are no erosion hazard areas downstream from the discharge;

(2) Discharged at flow durations matching predeveloped conditions, with adequate energy dissipation, into existing channels that previously conveyed stormwater runoff in the predeveloped state; or

(3) Dispersed discharge upslope of the steep slope onto a low-gradient undisturbed buffer demonstrated to be adequate to infiltrate all surface and stormwater runoff, and where it can be demonstrated that such discharge will not increase the saturation of the slope;

(h) Subdivisions. The division of land in landslide hazard areas and associated buffers is subject to the following:

(1) Land that is located wholly within a landslide hazard area or its buffer may not be subdivided. Land that is located partially within a landslide hazard area or its buffer may be divided; provided, that each resulting lot has sufficient buildable area outside of, and will not affect, the landslide hazard area or its buffer.

(2) Access roads and utilities may be permitted within the landslide hazard area and associated buffers if the city determines that no other feasible alternative exists; and

(i) Prohibited Development. On-site sewage disposal systems, including drain fields, shall be prohibited within erosion and landslide hazard areas and related buffers. (Ord. 1375 § 5, 2005).
