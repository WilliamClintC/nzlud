Additional time required to respond to a request may be based on the need to clarify the intent of the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, or to determine whether any of the information requested is exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request. The city may ask the requestor to clarify what information the requestor is seeking. If the requestor fails to clarify the request, the city need not respond to it.

Payment for the cost of reproduction of all public records shall be made at the time the request for public records is submitted. If there is uncertainty as to the amount required, the amount tendered shall be based upon the rates and charges adopted by resolution of the city council pursuant to this chapter. If the actual amount of the cost of reproduction exceeds the amount tendered, the balance shall be paid upon delivery of the requested copy or copies. In the event the amount tendered exceeds the actual costs, the balance shall be refunded by the city within a reasonable amount of time. Except as specifically provided herein, there shall be no refunds. The charges for photocopying shall be established by the city clerk and approved by resolution of the city council. In the event the city retains the use of outside services to make copies of records, tapes and/or documents, the actual costs charged by such outside services shall be paid by the person requesting the record. Nothing herein shall be construed to apply to charges for accident reports pursuant to RCW 46.52.085.

The following procedures shall apply unless inconsistent with an order of the Chelan County superior court:

A. When the city is required to prepare a verbatim written transcript of any proceeding of the city in response to a writ of review or other action filed in the superior court or any other state or federal court, the cost of preparing the same shall be borne by the party filing the action pursuant to rates and charges as proposed by the city clerk and approved by resolution of the city council. The party filing such action shall pay to the city clerk the estimated costs, as determined by the city clerk, of the preparation of the transcript based on the aforementioned rates and charges, including copying costs and the city clerk shall thereafter have the transcript prepared.

B. Should the actual cost incurred by the city in the preparation of the transcript exceed the amount deposited with the city clerk, the party making such deposit shall be required to reimburse the city for such additional amount within ten days of notification that such amount is due or prior to the time the transcript is required to be filed with the court, whichever occurs first.

Additional pages of one or more signatures may be added to the petition by filing the same with the city clerk prior to such terminal date. No signatures shall be accepted or withdrawn after such terminal date. Any signer of a filed petition may withdraw his or her signature by a written request for withdrawal filed with the receiving officer prior to such terminal date. Such written request shall so sufficiently describe the petition as to make identification of the person and the petition certain. The name of any person seeking to withdraw shall be signed exactly the same as contained on the petition and, after the filing of such request for withdrawal, prior to the terminal date, the signature of any person seeking such withdrawal shall be deemed withdrawn.

E. Petitions containing the required number of signatures shall be accepted as prima facie valid until their invalidity has been proved.

F. A variation on petitions between the signatures on the petition and that on the voter’s permanent registration caused by the substitution of initials instead of the first or middle names, or both, shall not invalidate the signature on the petition if the surname and handwriting are the same.

G. Signatures, including the original, of any person who has signed a petition two or more times shall be stricken.

H. Signatures followed by a date of signing which is more than ninety days prior to the date of filing of the petition shall be stricken. (Ord. 719 § 10, 1983).

If the signatures are found by the clerk to be insufficient the petition may be amended in that respect within ten days from the date of the certificate. Within ten days after submission of the amended petition the clerk shall make an examination thereof and append a certificate thereto in the same manner as before. If the second certificate shall also show the number of signatures to be insufficient, the petition shall be returned to the person filing it. (Ord. 719 § 11, 1983).

Instead, the city may use the small works roster procedures for public works projects as set forth herein.

The small works roster shall consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the roster, and where required by law are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in this state.

1. A contract awarded from the small works roster need not be advertised. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation.

As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least five contractors on the small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the roster.

If the estimated cost of the work is from one hundred thousand dollars to two hundred thousand dollars, the city may choose to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors on the small works roster, but must also notify the remaining appropriate contractors on the small works roster that quotations on the work are being sought.

a. Publishing notice in a legal newspaper in general circulation in the area where the work is to be done;

b. Mailing a notice to these contractors; or 

c. Sending a notice to these contractors by facsimile or other electronic means.

3. For purposes of this resolution, “equitably distribute” means that the city may not favor certain contractors on the small works roster over other contractors on the small works roster who perform similar services. At the time bids are solicited, the city shall not inform a contractor of the terms or amount of any other contractor’s bid for the same project.

4. A written record shall be made by the city representative of each contractor’s bid on the project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by telephone inquiry.

5. At least once every year a list of the contracts awarded pursuant to this section shall be furnished to the city council and made available to the general public. The list shall contain the name of the contractor or vendor awarded the contract, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed or items purchased under the contract, and the date it was awarded. The list shall also state the location where the bid quotations for these contracts are available for public inspection.

E. Determining Lowest Responsible Bidder. All contracts awarded pursuant to this section shall be awarded to the “lowest responsible bidder” as defined in RCW 43.19.1911, as the same exists now or may hereafter be amended.

2.80.110 Requirement and responsibility to comply with enforced codes.

A. The enforced codes were adopted pursuant to the city’s police powers to protect the public’s health, safety, and welfare. It is mandatory to comply with the provisions of the enforced codes.

B. It is unlawful for any person to violate any enforced code. In addition to the violator, there is a rebuttable presumption that the owner of a vehicle, building, structure, premises, personal property or land upon or within which a violation has occurred or is occurring is also responsible for the violation, so long as the owner had or has actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time the violation occurred or is occurring.

C. Any adult who is responsible for the care or supervision of a juvenile less than eighteen years of age is liable for any violation of the enforced codes committed by the juvenile, so long as the responsible adult had or has actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time the violation occurred or is occurring. (Ord. 1502 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2015).


2.80.120 Alternative enforcement procedures.

Upon determining a violation has occurred or is occurring, the enforcement officer, in the enforcement officer’s opinion of the determination of the seriousness and severity of the violation, may utilize one or a combination of the following enforcement procedures, as well as any other remedies available under law, in order to abate the violation:

A. Correction Notice. The enforcement officer may issue a correction notice requiring a violator abate a violation by a specific date. The correction notice may not impose monetary penalties or costs and is not subject to appeal.

B. Correction Order. The enforcement officer may issue a correction order requiring a violator abate a violation be corrected by a specific date. The correction order may impose monetary penalties and costs according to Section 2.80.160.

1. A failure to comply with the requirements of a correction order constitutes a second or subsequent violation and may result in the issuance of an additional notice or order.

2. It shall be a separate violation for each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation occurs.

C. Revocation Order. The enforcement officer may issue a revocation order revoking a permit, or ordering activity conducted pursuant to a permit to cease, when the enforcement officer determines any one or more of the following exists:

1. The permittee is not complying with the terms of the permit, license or approved plans;

2. The permit or license was issued in error, either of law or fact;

3. The activity for which the permit or license was issued constitutes an illegal activity;

4. The permit or license was procured by fraud or the false representation of facts, misleading statements, evasions or the suppression of material facts; or

5. The condition or activity which is the subject of the permit or license is a hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare.

D. Abatement. The enforcement officer may abate a violation. The process the enforcement officer abates a violation is based upon the type of violation, and the enforcement officer’s reasonable opinion of the violation’s impact upon the health and safety of the public, as follows:

1. Abatement upon Notice. When the violator is known and can be notified of the violation, the enforcement officer may abate a violation upon the failure of the violator to abate the violation after the following periods of alternative notices to the violator and the enforcement officer’s issuance of a correction order requiring the violation to be abated by a specific time:

a. Three Days. When the violation causes or constitutes or reasonably appears to cause or constitute an imminent or immediate danger to the health or safety of persons or property, upon notice to the violator of three days;

b. Seven Days. When the violation does not cause or constitute an imminent or immediate danger to the health or safety or persons or property, but will develop into such a condition, through the passage of time, upon notice to the violator of seven days;

c. Fifteen Days. In all other cases, upon notice to the violator of fifteen days.

2. Abatement without Notice. Whenever any violation causes or constitutes or reasonably appears to cause or constitute an imminent or immediate danger to the health or safety of persons, and the violator is not known or cannot be contacted, the enforcement officer may abate the violation, without notice.

3. Abatement by Suit. The enforcement officer may proceed by a suit in the Chelan County superior court to enjoin, abate, or remediate a violation in the manner provided by Chapter 7.48 RCW. In any action brought in the superior court, when it is established that a violation exists, the superior court shall, together with the imposition of monetary penalty and costs, enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the case, which order shall direct either:

a. That the violation be abated by the violator within the time determined by the court, but not more than thirty days; and/or

b. That the violation may be abated by the city, with the city’s costs and attorneys’ fees to be imposed upon the violator.

Proceeding under the provisions of this subsection (D)(3) shall not prejudice the city’s ability to proceed to abate the violation under subsections (D)(1) or (2) of this section.

4. Method of Abatement. The city may abate the violation with its own forces, or through an independent party.

5. Costs of Abatement. The violator shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city in abating the violation, and the city shall have a lien for such costs on the property on which the violation was located, to be enforced or collected as a lien for labor and materials, pursuant to Chapter 60.04 RCW, except that the lien shall not terminate for lack of action to foreclose.

E. Criminal Prosecution. A third violation of the same provision of an enforced code within a two-year period shall constitute a misdemeanor.

F. Correction Agreement. The enforcement officer may enter into a correction agreement with the violator, the result of which is to abate the violation. A correction agreement is a contract between the city and the violator where the violator agrees to abate a violation within a specified time and according to specified conditions. The following shall govern the rights and responsibilities of the violator and the city pursuant to a correction agreement, which shall be specifically stated in the correction agreement:

1. The name and address of the violator;

2. The street address or a description sufficient for identifying the building, structure, premises, or land where the violation is occurring;

3. A description of the violation, and the section of the enforced code that is violated;

4. The necessary action to be taken to abate the violation, together with the date or time by which violation must be corrected;

5. The enforcement officer may enter and inspect the property to determine compliance with the correction agreement;

6. The violator waives the right to an appeal of the violation and/or the method of abatement; and

7. If the terms of the correction agreement are not satisfied, the violator shall be assessed a monetary penalty commencing on the date set for abatement, plus costs, and the city may enter the property and abate the violation without notice, pursuant to subsection D of this section.

Nothing in this subsection prevents the enforcement officer from extending the time for abating the violation, or modifying the required abatement if, in the enforcement officer’s reasonable opinion, the violator has exhibited due diligence and/or substantial progress in abating the violation but that unforeseen circumstances render the abatement under the original conditions unattainable.

G. Judicial Relief. Nothing in this chapter prevents the city from filing a complaint or petition in a court of competent jurisdiction to seek any relief authorized by law before first seeking compliance through enforcement mechanisms identified in this section, when civil, administrative enforcement options or criminal prosecution would not prove timely or effective. (Ord. 1502 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2015).


2.80.130 Required elements of notices and orders.

A. Content of All Notices and Orders. Notices and orders authorized by this chapter shall include such information necessary to apprise the violator of the violation, the action to be taken by the violator pursuant to the notice or order, and the monetary penalties and/or costs that may be imposed upon the violator upon failing to act according to the notice or order. Such information may include, but is not limited to the following:

1. The date of the violation;

2. The name and address of the violator, if known to the enforcement officer;

B. Additional Content – Noncumulative Monetary Penalties. In cases where notice or order does not seek to impose cumulative monetary penalties, the notice or order shall also include the following additional information:

1. A statement whether the violation is a first or repeat violation, and if a repeat violation, whether it is a second or subsequent violation; and

2. The monetary penalty.

C. Additional Content – Cumulative Monetary Penalties. In cases where the notice or order seeks to impose cumulative monetary penalties for continuing violations of an enforced code, notices or orders shall also include the following additional information:

1. The violator shall automatically incur a daily monetary penalty, pursuant to whether the violation is a first, second or subsequent violation if the violator fails to timely correct the violation;

2. Daily monetary penalties shall accrue during an appeal period unless the violator prevails on appeal; and that accrued monetary penalties shall not exceed five times the amount of the daily monetary penalty for any single violation from the first date of the violation through the date a final decision is rendered after an appeal; and

3. The violator may appeal the imposition of cumulative daily monetary penalties only.

D. Failure to Include Information. The failure to include all information set out in subsections A, B and C of this section shall not render a notice or order void or unenforceable so long as the notice or order reasonably apprises the violator of the violation and the action to be taken by the violator pursuant to the notice or order, but shall be considered in calculating the total monetary penalty assessed against the violator. (Ord. 1502 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2015).


2.80.140 Service of notices and orders.

A. Service. The enforcement officer shall cause notices or orders to be served upon the violator, either personally, or by mailing a copy of it to the violator’s last known address and by conspicuously affixing or posting it on the building, structure, premises, personal property, or land upon or within which the violation has occurred or is occurring. If cumulative daily monetary penalties are sought, service by posting may only be done if the violator cannot be personally served within Chelan County and if an address for mailed service cannot be ascertained by reference to public records. If the violator is the owner of the property that is the site of the violation, but does not live at the site of the violation, and if the personal address of the violator is unknown, the enforcement officer may serve the notice or order by mailing it to the billing address for the property that is on file in the Chelan County assessor’s office.

B. Additional Persons to Be Served. If known or disclosed from the Chelan County assessor’s office, one copy of the notice or order may be served on the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust or other lien or encumbrance of record or any lease of record or the holder of any other estate or legal interest of record in any building, structure, land, personal property or premises on which a violation has occurred or is occurring. The failure to effect service on any person permitted to be served according to this subsection shall not invalidate any proceeding under this chapter as to any other person duly served or relieve any such person from any duty or obligation imposed by this chapter.

C. Service Requirements for Nuisance Vehicles. A notice or order concerning a nuisance vehicle must be served upon:

1. The last registered and legal owner of record of the nuisance vehicle, unless the nuisance vehicle is in such a condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership; and

2. The owner of record of the property upon which the nuisance vehicle is located.

D. Service by Posting. If the violator is served by posting it shall be treated in the same manner as service by mailing.

E. Proof of Service. Proof of service shall be made by a written declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the person effecting service, declaring the time and date of service, and the manner by which service was made. Additionally, if served by posting and cumulative penalties are sought, the declaration shall include the facts showing the efforts used in attempting to serve the person personally or by mail. (Ord. 1502 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2015).


2.80.150 Prohibition against issuance of permits.

The city shall not issue any permit to a violator or to a business, corporation, limited liability company or partnership in which a violator has an interest, until the enforcement officer has verified the violation has been abated. (Ord. 1502 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2015).


2.80.160 Monetary penalties and costs.

A violator shall incur monetary penalties and costs under a notice or order, to be collected and enforced by the city, as follows:

A. Initial Monetary Penalty. A violator shall incur an initial monetary penalty according to the schedule in subsection C of this section.

B. Cumulative Daily Monetary Penalty. In addition to the initial monetary penalty assessed in subsection A of this section, a violator shall incur a cumulative daily monetary penalty according to the schedule in subsection C of this section, for each day the violator fails to comply with a notice or order by the date specified in the notice or order; provided, a cumulative daily monetary penalty shall not accrue if the notice or order does not advise the violator of the right to appeal the accrual of the cumulative daily monetary penalty, pursuant to Section 2.80.130(C).

C. Schedule of Monetary Penalties. The monetary penalties for first, second and subsequent violations of an enforced code within any two-year period shall be set out on the city’s rate resolution.

D. Accrual of Cumulative Daily Monetary Penalties During Appeal. Cumulative daily monetary penalties shall accrue during the period where a violation has been appealed unless the violator prevails on appeal. Accrued monetary penalties shall not exceed five times the amount of the daily monetary penalty for any single violation from the first date of the violation through the date of a final decision on an appeal.

E. Maximum Accrual of Cumulative Daily Monetary Penalties. The accrual of cumulative daily monetary penalties pursuant to a notice or order shall be limited to an amount equal to five times the daily monetary penalty.

F. Costs Incurred by the City. In addition to monetary penalties, the violator shall be assessed the costs incurred by the city.

G. Payment Does Not Excuse Nonabatement of a Violation. Payment of any monetary penalties associated with the violation does not relieve the violator of the duty to abate the violation.

H. Collection of Monetary Penalties and Costs.

1. Payment. Monetary penalties and costs shall be paid to the city ten calendar days after a notice or order is served on the violator is served or thirteen days after a notice or order is mailed to the violator. If a violation or the cumulative daily monetary penalty is appealed, monetary penalties and costs are due thirteen calendar days after the final decision from such appeal is mailed to the violator. The provisions of Title 3 and/or the city’s rate resolution for dishonored checks and late fees and interest shall apply to payments due under this chapter.

2. Approved Collection Methods. The enforcement officer and/or the city attorney or the city attorney’s designee is authorized to take any action authorized by law to collect monetary penalties and costs. The violator shall reimburse the city for its costs incurred to collect monetary penalties and costs.

3. Authority to Negotiate Settlement. The enforcement officer and/or the city attorney may negotiate a settlement, compromise or otherwise dispose of an action for the collection of monetary penalties and costs when to do so would be in the best interest of the city.

I. Lien. Upon a failure to pay monetary penalties and costs when due, the city shall have a lien on the property on which a violation occurs. Such lien shall be subordinate to all previously existing special assessment liens imposed on the property and shall be superior to all other liens, except for state and county taxes. The claim of lien shall contain sufficient information regarding the notice or order, a description of the property to be charged with the lien, the owner of record and the total of the monetary penalties and costs. The claim of lien may be amended from time to time to reflect changed conditions. (Ord. 1502 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2015).


2.80.170 Inspection – Notice of compliance.

It shall be the violator’s obligation to request the enforcement officer inspect property to verify the violation has been abated. The enforcement officer shall serve a notice of compliance to the violator in the manner provided in Section 2.80.140 upon the enforcement officer’s verification that:

A. All violations identified in the notice or order have been abated;

B. All necessary permits have been issued and finalized; and

A. Appeal – Purpose. The violator may appeal the enforcement officer’s decision that a violation exists, the method of abatement or the amount of the monetary penalty to the city administrator, pursuant to this section, which shall be referred to as an “administrative appeal.” The purpose of the administrative appeal process is to afford an appellant with an opportunity to appeal the enforcement officer’s decision that a violation exists, the method of abatement, or the imposition of a monetary penalty quickly, and without the delays associated with an appeal to the hearing examiner under Section 2.80.220. Filing an administrative appeal is not a condition to the filing of an appeal under Section 2.80.220.

B. Filing an administrative appeal. The provisions of Section 2.80.220(B) shall apply to the administrative appeal, except for Section 2.80.220(B)(5).

C. Procedure. Because the administrative appeal is intended to afford an appellant a review of the enforcement officer’s decision within a short period of time, the procedures for the conduct of an administrative appeal shall be abbreviated.

1. Hearing Date. The hearing date shall be not less than three, nor more than thirty, days from the date the notice of appeal is filed with the city clerk.

2. Notices. Notices of all proceedings shall be based on the contact information provided by the appellant in the notice of appeal. The appellant shall be responsible for contacting the city clerk, the enforcement officer and the city administrator regarding all processes relating to the administrative appeal.

3. Hearing. The hearing shall be limited to two hours. The provisions of Sections 2.80.220(C) and (D) shall generally apply to the administrative appeal, and the city administrator shall exercise their discretion in conducting the hearing, balancing the right of the appellant to be heard, with the length of time allowed for an administrative appeal.

4. Decision. The city administrator shall issue a written decision within five business days of the hearing, generally following the guidelines for the content of decisions in Section 2.80.220(D), except that findings of fact and conclusions are not required.

5. Appeal to Hearing Examiner. The appellant may appeal the decision of the city administrator to the hearing examiner, as set out in Section 2.80.220, except that the appeal shall be filed no more than five calendar days from the date of the decision of the city administrator.

Except for an appeal from an administrative appeal under Section 2.80.210, an appeal of a notice or order shall be in writing, signed by the person appealing, and shall be filed with the city clerk no more than ten calendar days from the date the notice or order was served on the appellant or, if not served personally, no more than thirteen calendar days after the notice or order was mailed as provided in Section 2.80.140. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by the filing fee established by city council.

3. Content of Notice of Appeal. The notice of appeal shall include the following information:

a. The appellant’s name, address, telephone number and electronic mail address;

d. The grounds for the appeal, including any alleged error of fact or law in the notice or order;

e. The relief sought by the appellant; and

f. A certification under oath by the appellant that the information in the notice of appeal is true.

4. Administrative Denial of Untimely Appeals. The enforcement officer may administratively deny an appeal as untimely if the notice of appeal is not timely filed. The administrative denial shall be in writing and served in compliance with Section 2.80.140. An appellant may appeal the enforcement officer’s administrative denial by filing an appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction within thirty days of the denial.

5. Failure to Appeal. Failure to appeal a notice or order constitutes a waiver of all right to an appeal and contest the violation or imposition of monetary penalties and/or costs.

C. Pre-Hearing Procedures.

1. Hearing Date. As soon as practical after receiving the notice of appeal, and after coordinating with the hearing examiner, the enforcement officer shall set a date, time and place for the hearing of the appeal, which shall be not less than thirty calendar days nor more than ninety calendar days from the date the notice of appeal was filed with the city clerk.

2. Notice of Hearing. The enforcement officer shall provide the appellant with notice of the time and place of the hearing by mail to the address provided by the appellant on the notice of appeal at least twenty calendar days prior to the date of the hearing.

3. Hearings Concerning Nuisance Vehicles. If the appeal concerns a nuisance vehicle, the enforcement officer shall also send written notice of time and place of the hearing, by certified mail, to the following persons:

a. The owner of the land where the nuisance vehicle is located, as shown on the records of the Chelan County auditor; and

b. The last registered and legal owner of record of the nuisance vehicle, unless the nuisance vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.

4. Subpoenas. The hearing examiner, at the request of a party, may subpoena witnesses necessary for the presentation of their respective cases. The subpoena may be served by the city or appellant either personally or by mailing a copy of the subpoena to the witness’s last known address. Proof of service shall be made by written declaration and executed by the person effecting service, declaring the time and date of service and the manner by which service was made. It shall be a misdemeanor to knowingly ignore the directives of a subpoena under this subsection.

5. Submission of Materials. The enforcement officer and appellant shall deliver to the hearing examiner and to each other all materials relevant to the appeal, including, but not limited to, staff reports, legal memoranda, exhibits, names of potential witnesses, along with a brief summary of any witness’s expected testimony, and any affidavits or declaration, at least seven calendar days before the scheduled hearing.

6. Pre-Hearing Conference. The hearing examiner may adopt procedures prior to an appeal hearing which will make the appeal hearing more efficient.

D. Appeal Hearings. The city has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation occurred, the required corrective action conforms to the enforced code and the monetary penalties are correctly imposed. The scope of review in an appeal hearing is de novo, except that the hearing examiner shall defer to the enforcement officer’s legal interpretation of the enforced code, unless the enforcement officer’s interpretation is arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous. Otherwise appeal hearings shall comply with the requirements of open record hearings at Chapter 19.30.

1. Special Provisions for Hearings Concerning Nuisance Vehicles.

a. The owner of the property on which a nuisance vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing or present a written statement in time for consideration at the hearing and deny responsibility for the presence of the nuisance vehicle on the property.

b. The city may offer evidence to rebut the owner’s denial.

c. If the hearing examiner determines after hearing that the nuisance vehicle was placed on the owner’s property without the owner’s consent and that the owner did not subsequently acquiesce in its presence, then the city shall not be authorized to assess the monetary penalty and costs for the nuisance vehicle against the property upon which the nuisance vehicle is located or collect them from the owner.

E. Decision. The hearing examiner shall determine whether the city has established by a preponderance of evidence that a violation occurred and that the abatement conforms to the requirements of the enforced code, and shall issue a written decision that affirms, vacates, or modifies the notice or order and include the following:

1. Findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the decision;

2. The required abatement action, if any;

3. The date and time by which the abatement action, if any, must be completed;

7. The date and time when the city may abate the violation if the required corrective action is not taken within the time provided in the decision and that the appellant will be responsible for the city’s costs in completing the abatement.

8. If the appeal involves a nuisance vehicle, if the hearing examiner determines that a vehicle is a nuisance vehicle, the hearing examiner shall direct the Chelan County sheriff to dispose of the nuisance vehicle, or part thereof, under applicable law, and to give notice to the Washington State Patrol and the Washington Department of Licensing that the nuisance vehicle has been wrecked.

F. Cost of Appeal. The hearing examiner shall assess the costs of an appeal, including, but not limited to the hearing examiner’s fees and reasonable costs of staff time, if the hearing examiner finds the appeal was frivolous, or when an appellant fails to appear at an appeal hearing, unless for good cause shown for such failure.

G. Notice of Decision. The hearing examiner shall transmit their decision to the enforcement officer within ten calendar days after the appeal hearing. The enforcement officer shall serve the appellant with a copy of the decision in the same manner as serving notice of the appeal hearing.

Under the mode of “Payment by Bonds,” the ordinance levying assessments for the payment of the cost and expense of local improvements shall provide that the sum charged against each lot, tract and parcel of land and other property or any portion of such sum may be paid during the thirty day period following the first publication of a notice by the city treasurer that such assessment roll is in his hands for collection, and that thereafter the sum remaining unpaid may be paid in equal annual installments, the number of which installments shall be less by two than the number of years, which the bonds issued to pay for the improvement may run, with interest upon the whole unpaid sum so charged at a rate fixed by said ordinance, and each year thereafter one of such installments together with the interest due thereon and all installments thereafter to become due shall be collected in the same manner as shall be provided by law for the collection of assessments for such improvements in cases where no bonds are issued: Provided, that the lien of any such assessment may be discharged at any time after the said thirty days by paying the entire unpaid portion thereof, with all penalty and cost attaching, together with all interest thereon to date of delinquency of the installment thereof next falling due.

Any installments not paid prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period during which such installment is due and payable, shall thereupon become delinquent.

During the progress of the work, at the last of each month, the city engineer shall issue an estimate of the amount of work completed during the month, a complete estimate when the work is completed during the month, a complete estimate when the work is completed and a final estimate after a period of thirty days from said complete estimate. The final estimate shall include, in addition to a statement of the amount of money due the contractor, a statement of the amount of money expended for abstracts, advertising and engineering prior to the date set for the completion of the contract.

The city clerk shall on or about the tenth day of the month following the issuance of the estimate by the city engineer deliver to the contractor money or warrants in an amount equal to eighty-five percent of such estimate.

Upon delinquency a penalty of five percent, shall attach to, and become part of all such assessments. Delinquent assessments shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum until paid.

Whenever, on the first day of January of any year, two installments of any local improvement district assessments shall be delinquent, or the final installment thereof shall have been delinquent for more than one year, the city treasurer shall, on or before the first day of June in such year, proceed with foreclosure of all such delinquent assessments or installments thereof, as the case may be, by proceedings in the Superior Court of the state of Washington in and for Chelan County, therefore in an action brought in the name of the city of Chelan in accordance with the provisions of RCW 35.50.030, and all acts amendatory thereof.

In such cases the taxpayer shall make monthly returns similar to the annual returns provided for herein on or before the 10th day of the month, under oath or affirmation, covering the business of the previous month.

In all other cases where a person commences during any tax year to engage in any business, occupation, pursuit or privilege, he shall be entitled to a license for the remainder of such tax year for the required fee apportioned in the ratio of said remainder to a full tax year.

3. Operating License Revocation. If an owner lapses in renewing the annual licenses or fails to provide adequate renewal criteria, an operating license shall be revoked by the city under Section 5.15.100. The exception to these criteria for continuation of an operating license is a temporary hardship exception, which includes submission of proof, acceptable to the city, that: (a) a medical condition of the owner or family member jeopardizes the ability of the owner to operate the short-term rental; or (b) the death of the spouse or family member jeopardizes the ability of the owner to operate the short-term rental; or (c) structural integrity of the short-term rental deems it uninhabitable for tenants and is not self-imposed. The city may attach a time limit to this hardship exception. A time limit may be set by the administrator but shall not exceed six months. A one-time extension may be approved upon request if one of the conditions of this section still applies.

The owner or authorized agent shall either: (i) provide an annual mailing, or otherwise distribute by hand, a flier to neighbors within a two-hundred-fifty-foot radius of the short-term rental property address containing the owner and/or qualified person contact information, or (ii) post a small placard or sign as permitted by Chapter 17.58, Signs, near the adjacent street advising neighbors and tenants of the same information where it can be seen from the public right-of-way. The purpose of this notice is so that adjacent property owners and residents can contact a responsible person to report and request resolution of problems associated with the operation of the short-term rental. If the permanent contact information changes during the license period, the new information must be mailed or distributed again, or changed on the placard or sign.

b. Renewals. Renewal applications may provide evidence of placard in lieu of annual mailings or distribution.

c. Electronic Availability. In addition, the city will make a database electronically accessible within which any person can enter in an address of a short-term rental and obtain the owner/authorized agent and/or qualified person’s name and telephone number.

6. No Pending Actions or Violations. At the time of application, the owner of a short-term rental shall not have received a civil citation regarding compliance of the subject short-term rental property with any provision of the Chelan Municipal Code. A voluntary assurance of compliance, negotiated compliance agreement, or deferred sentence agreement will satisfy the requirement that there be no pending actions or violations.

This record shall be made available for city inspection upon request to investigate under subsection (A)(3) of this section.

2. City Authority.

a. Certain types of complaints are subject to the city’s regulatory authority under other sections of the Chelan Municipal Code (noise complaints, nuisance, disorderly conduct, etc.). Other complaints related to occupancy and on-site parking are subject to the city’s code enforcement authority pursuant to this chapter. It is not intended that the owner, agent or qualified person act as a peace officer or code enforcement officer or put themselves in an at-risk situation. However, reasonable initial inquiries or complaints related to noise, disturbances, occupancy or parking may first be made to the owner or qualified person.

b. Complaints specifically related to the good neighbor guidelines, or the condition, operation or conduct of occupants of the short-term rental, should first be made to the owner or qualified person. If there is a failure to respond or a clearly inadequate response by the owner or representative, a complaint may be submitted to the city on a form provided by the city and the city will respond or investigate as needed. The city will first seek voluntary compliance or resolution, but if the city finds that substantial evidence supports further action given the complaint(s), the city will follow the warning procedures set forth in Chapter 2.80.

3. Records. On request and in compliance with the public records law, the city shall provide the owner, authorized agent and/or qualified person with the information in the complaint.

4. Grounds for Warning. Repeated failure of the owner or qualified person to timely and reasonably respond to a complaint(s) relayed by city staff is considered grounds for a warning and potential revocation under Section 5.15.100. Issuance of a noise citation to a tenant may be grounds for a warning to the owner, only if, under the circumstances in the reasonable judgment of the administrator, the owner should be held responsible. Issuance of a public nuisance citation may be grounds for a warning in the appropriate circumstances.

5. Administrative Rules. The administrator shall have the authority to establish administrative rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out, furthering, and enforcing the provisions of this chapter. A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the office of the city clerk and be posted on the city website. (Ord. 1570 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).

8.30.100 Methods and techniques.

The following shall be the official methods and techniques utilized for testing noise emissions from vehicles in the city:

A. The Pass-By Technique for Motor Vehicles. A measuring site shall be selected which shall be open and free of sound-reflecting surfaces within a one-hundred-foot radius of the position of the microphone. The sound level meter shall be properly operating and calibrated. Fifty feet shall be measured between the path of travel of the vehicle to be tested and the microphone which shall be four feet above the ground. The recorded reading shall be the highest sound level obtained as the vehicle passes by, disregarding unrelated peaks due to ambient sounds. These measurements of motor vehicle noise shall be in compliance with WAC 204-56-010 and WAC 204-56-020 issued by the Department of Ecology. When a clear one-hundred-foot radius is not feasible, the noise level adjustment schedule in the above-cited codes may be used.

B. The Pass-By Technique for Snowmobiles. A measuring site shall be selected, which shall be open and free of sound-reflecting surfaces within a one-hundred-foot radius of the position of the microphone. The sound level meter shall be properly operating and calibrated. Fifty feet shall be measured from the path of travel of the snowmobile to be tested to the microphone, which shall be four feet above the snow pack level of the path of travel of the snowmobile. The snowmobile shall pass by at full throttle, and the recorded reading shall be the highest sound level obtained as the snowmobile passes by, disregarding unrelated peaks due to ambient sounds. The measurement of snowmobile noise using the pass-by technique shall be in compliance with the Forest Service Winter Test Procedures, Test Report 7120-5.

C. The Shoreline Pass-By Technique for Motorized Watercraft. A properly operating and calibrated sound level meter shall be set up directly at the shoreline of a body of water, in a position four feet above the level of the water. No sound-reflecting surfaces shall be within a one-hundred-foot radius of the microphone. As a motorized watercraft passes within the scope of the measurement of the sound level meter, the recorded reading shall be the highest sound level obtained, disregarding unrelated peaks due to ambient sounds. The measurements of motorized watercraft noise using the pass-by technique shall be in reasonable compliance with the Society of Automotive Engineers test procedure J34.

D. The Fixed-Distance Pass-by Technique for Watercraft. A properly operating and calibrated sound level meter shall be set up four to five feet above the water surface and no closer than two feet from a dock or deck surface. Aside from the tester and the subject, the site shall be free of large obstructions, such as boats, buildings, hills, large piers, etc., for a distance of one hundred feet around the microphone and the subject’s test path. The water shall be free from rough waves, and the wind shall not be blowing strongly. At least two buoys or markers shall be placed the correct distance (either fifty or one hundred feet) from the microphone. The test craft shall pass at full throttle one to three feet from the far side of the markers. The meter shall be set at fast response and the highest sound level for the run shall be applicable. Both sides of the boat should be tested and the average of the two shall be the sound level of the watercraft. The measurement of watercraft using this pass-by technique is based upon Society of Automotive Engineers test procedure J34.

E. The Half-Meter Method for All Motor Vehicles Under Ten Thousand GVWR or GCWR (Excluding Motorcycles). The microphone for a properly operating and calibrated sound level meter shall be placed at the same height as the center of the exhaust outlet. The microphone shall be no closer to the ground or pavement than eight inches when the exhaust is lower than this height (see Figure 1 attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk). The sound level meter shall be positioned with its longitudinal axis parallel to the ground, twenty inches (± one inch) from the axis of the outlet (see Figure 2 on file in the city clerk’s office). For exhaust outlets located under the vehicle body, the sound level meter shall be located at the specified angle and at least eight inches from the nearest part of the vehicle (see Figure 3 on file in the city clerk’s office). For exhaust outlets with different exhaust angles or dual side-by-side exhaust, the microphone positions illustrated on Figure 4, on file in the city clerk’s office, shall be duplicated within above specified tolerances.

The engine shall be at normal operating temperature with the transmission in neutral. Measurement shall be made at three quarters of maximum RPM. If RPM data is unavailable, three thousand RPM shall be used.

The recorded exhaust system sound level of a stationary vehicle shall be the highest reading obtained during the test, disregarding peaks due to extraneous ambient noise. When there is more than one exhaust outlet, the sound level shall be for the loudest outlet. When there are two or more exhaust outlets separated by less than twelve inches, measurements shall be made on the outlet closest to the side or rear of the vehicle (see Figure 4 on file in the city clerk’s office).

This measurement technique follows California Highway Patrol Title 13, Register 75, Number 48, Article 9.

F. The Half-meter Method for Motorcycles. A properly operating and calibrated sound level meter shall be placed directly behind the exhaust pipe, tilted at an upward angle of forty-five degrees (Figure 5, on file in the city clerk’s office, illustrates this microphone position). The stationary motorcycle shall then maintain a steady engine speed of one-half maximum (“red line”) engine speed, or the speed in RPM calculated at sixty percent of the speed at which maximum horsepower is attained. The measurement of motorcycle noise using the half-meter method is based upon the Motorcycle Industry Council’s stationary test MIC/E - 76.

G. Methods for Monitoring in Noise-sensitive Areas. The measuring site shall be on property purported to be receiving excessive noise, and shall be at least ten feet from the property line in closest proximity to the noise source. The measuring point shall be at least ten feet from any building, wall or other sound-obstructing object, and no individual other than the operator shall be within ten feet of the sound level meter.

The properly operating and calibrated sound level meter shall be pointed toward the noise source and be at least four feet above the ground. Monitoring shall proceed for the duration needed to determine whether provisions of Section 8.30.070 have been violated. The operator shall keep an accurate record of the dBA levels recorded and their durations, regarding unrelated peaks due to extraneous ambient sound. (Ord. 654 § 1000, 1980).


8.30.110 Violations.

Any person who causes a vehicle to emit a noise which is proven through the measurements in Section 8.30.100 of this chapter to exceed the levels of Sections 8.30.050 through 8.30.070, or which violates Section 8.30.040 in the discretion of the law enforcement officer, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars or be imprisoned in the city jail for a period of not longer than thirty days or both. Any vehicle found in violation of this chapter shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be subject to abatement by a sustaining order, confiscation order or injunction order issued by the court.

Any vehicle found in violation of this chapter shall report to the Chelan County sheriff within thirty days of conviction to be tested for compliance with this chapter, or show cause (demolition, etc.) why this is not possible. (Ord. 1287 § 6, 2004; Ord. 654 § 1100, 1980).


8.30.120 Enforcement.

A law enforcement officer may direct a vehicle or watercraft suspected to be in violation of this chapter to submit to noise measurement. (Ord. 654 § 1200, 1980).


8.30.130 Undue hardship.

Should any person anticipate any activity that may not comply with the provisions of this chapter, and can demonstrate that undue hardship would be rendered upon them by compliance with this chapter, that person may apply for relief from the provisions of this chapter to be granted at the discretion of the city. Such relief may have stip-ulations that provide other dBA limitations, time of day limitations and expiration dates. (Ord. 654 § 1300, 1980).

Chapter 8.42 GRAFFITI REGULATIONS

Sections:

8.42.010    Purpose and intent.

8.42.020    Definitions.

8.42.030    Graffiti regulations.

8.42.035    Removal of graffiti – Violations, penalties and enforcement.

8.42.040    Violation.


8.42.010 Purpose and intent.

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. Graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive to the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. It is appropriate to require people convicted of defacement to restore the property. However, defacement is typically committed quickly and secretively and witnesses to the defacement typically do not exist, so it is rare that property subjected to defacement is restored by those persons who cause the defacement. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city and its citizens. This chapter intends to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property by an offender. (Ord. 1371 § 1 (part), 2008).

(Ord. 1050 § 1, 1996).


12.28.040 Application eligibility.

A. Whenever a developer is required to construct a street project as a condition of further property development as required by an ordinance of the city or where the developer is required to construct water or sewer facilities as a result of a determination of the director or city council, where the project and/or water or sewer facilities, all collectively referred to as “improvements,” benefit nonparticipating properties, the developer may apply for a latecomer agreement to establish a reimbursement area that includes other properties benefiting from the improvements. Such application shall be filed with the director prior to commencing work on the improvements.

B. In order to be eligible for a latecomer agreement, the cost of the improvement must not be less than fifty thousand dollars. The cost of the improvement shall be determined, based upon a construction contract for the project, bids, engineering or architectural estimates, receipts or other information deemed by the director to be a reliable basis for determining cost.

6. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste-or-odor-producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the director as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other public agencies having jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;

7. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;

8. Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5;

9. Materials which exert or cause:

 a. Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries and lime residues or of dissolved solids such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, 

b. Excessive discoloration such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, 

c. Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works,

d. Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting “slugs” as defined in this chapter;

10. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.

E. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection D of this section, and which in the judgment of the director, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the director may:

1. Reject the wastes;

2. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewer;

3. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

4. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of Chapter 13.08 of this code.

If the director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the director, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.

F. Grease, oil and sand separators shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such separators shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All separators shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.

G. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.

H. When required by the director, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.

I. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods of the Examination of Water and Wastewater” published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples.

J. No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial concern provided that the following criteria are met:

1. The city has the physical capacity for treatment; and

2. The industrial waste is compatible with the biological treatment process as determined by the city. (Ord. 829 § 4 (part), 1987).

The owner of the moorage facility or property to which said vessel or floating structure is moored shall provide the proper pump and connection to said system. Alternatively, any vessel or other floating structure used for permanent residential or commercial purposes which have effective means aboard to treat sanitary drainage and eliminate all liquid effluent may be exempted from the requirement to discharge to a sanitary sewer, provided the treatment system on the vessel discharges no liquid overboard, and provided further, that any discharge to the atmosphere is odorless and complies fully with all limits set by local and state agencies. (Ord. 829 § 4 (part), 1987).


13.06.080 Powers and authority of inspectors.

A. The director and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

B. The director and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the city holds an easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying within said easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the easement pertaining to the private property involved. (Ord. 829 § 4 (part), 1987).


13.06.090 Failure to connect.

If any sewer connection required in this chapter is not made within the time provided, the director is authorized and directed to cause the same to be made and file a statement of the cost thereof with the city clerk and thereon a warrant shall be issued by the city clerk against the sewer revenue fund for the payment of such cost. Such amount, together with a penalty of ten percent thereof, plus interest at the rate of ten percent per year upon the total amount of such cost and penalty, shall be assessed against the property upon which the building or structure is situated and shall become a lien thereon. Such total amount when collected shall be paid into said water and sewer revenue fund. (Ord. 829 § 4 (part), 1987).


13.06.100 Violations, penalties and enforcement.

Except as otherwise expressly provided, any violation of this chapter shall be enforced according to the uniform procedures set out in Chapter 2.80. (Ord. 1502 § 4 (Exh. G), 2015: Ord. 829 § 4 (part), 1987).

13.12.010 Billing and payment procedure.

A. Since the city provides year-round facilities for supplying water and collecting water, all users shall be billed for these services on a continuing basis. Billings will terminate upon disconnection from the system, but service will not be resumed until payment of a new connection, reconnection, or restoration fee for both sewer and water service, where applicable. Active military personnel shall not be required to pay a reconnection fee upon return from military activities. The city finance director shall be the sole determinant of determining active military eligibility. Billing will be on a monthly basis, and bills shall be due and payable upon receipt. Restoration fees shall apply to the first reconnection occurring after a nonirrigation water meter is removed from an unimproved lot. Subsequent reconnections shall be subject to payment of the reconnection fee in effect at the time of reconnection. Property qualifying for restoration fees pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the payment of any other connection charges.

B. Unpaid bills shall be delinquent on the first working day following the twenty-fifth day of each month and shall be assessed a delinquency fee in the amount of five percent of the outstanding current balance of water and/or sewer charges, representing the additional cost to the city for administration of the account; provided, however, the total amount of the delinquency fee shall not exceed the applicable amount that would be charged by the city for a new connection, including base charges and applicable local connection charges. Public entities, as defined in subsection C of this section, shall not be assessed the five percent delinquency fee on any outstanding balance due.

C. “Public entities” are defined as the United States of America or agencies thereof, the state of Washington, or political subdivisions or agencies thereof, school districts, irrigation districts, water districts, fire districts, or any other like public entities.

D. For inactive properties including, but not limited to, demolished buildings, any property that is thirty-six months in arrears of payment, either consecutively or collectively, shall automatically forfeit all general facilities charges (GFCs) and ERUs associated with said property. In full consideration of forfeiting the GFCs and ERUs, the city shall remove the accrued delinquent amount from the forfeited accounts, including late penalties, and send notice to property owner of same. Service to a property under this section can only occur by paying new connection charges at the then-current rate, as if it were a vacant property. No credits will be issued for past payments on the property account.

E. Voluntary relinquishment of GFCs and ERUs associated with an inactive property, including but not limited to demolished buildings, is allowed at any time prior to being thirty-six months in arrears of payment. In full consideration of forfeiting the GFCs and ERUs, the city shall remove the accrued delinquent amount from their accounts, including late penalties, and send notice to property owner of same. No additional refunds or credits will be issued for past payments made on the property account. If a portion of GFCs and/or ERUs are to be retained by the property owner, past due amounts on the retained GFCs must immediately be paid in full, prior to finalizing relinquishment of remaining GFCs and ERUs. Service to a property under this section can only be restored by paying full new connection charges at the then-current rate, as if it were a vacant property.

F. If a bill is over thirty days delinquent from the original date it was due and payable, the finance director may send the customer a shutoff notice.

G. Late Fees. Customers accruing a late fee will be allowed one waiver every twelve months upon verbal or written request to the finance director or his/her designee. All waivers will be noted in the customer’s utility account master file with the date such waiver was granted. (Ord. 1563 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 1459 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1342 §§ 1, 2, 2007; Ord. 1268 § 1, 2003: Ord. 1199 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1009 § 1, 1995: Ord. 900 § 1, 1990; Ord. 852 § 1, 1983: Ord. 722 § 1, 1983: Ord. 674 § 16, 1980).


13.12.020 Billing calculations.

The amount billed to the water customer for water service shall be calculated on the basis of the monthly base rate, which rate and gallons used will be established by resolution. In addition, all water used in excess of those amounts established shall be billed at the adopted rate per thousand gallons. When a single meter serves a number of customers or family units, the minimum gallonage and the base rate shall be increased in proportion to the number of customers or units served. After the winter season, the first billing shall reflect an allowance of the monthly gallons used since the prior meter reading. (Ord. 1563 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 1342 § 3, 2007: Ord. 1009 § 2, 1995: Ord. 674 § 17, 1980).

13.12.040 Payment – Owner responsibility.

The owner of the premises to which the water service is attached shall be responsible for the payment of all connections, shutoff/turn-on fees, service charges and liens. Accounts shall be established and remain in the owner’s name and bills shall be sent to the owner. (Ord. 1563 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 1342 § 4, 2007: Ord. 674 § 19, 1980).


13.12.050 Remission of utility service charges.

The finance director, or his/her designee, is hereby authorized to adjust or waive fees/charges under the following circumstances:

A. Excess water usage due to broken lines, leaks, or unexplained water consumption occurring in winter months to unread meters. If requested by the customer, the finance director is authorized to allow a one-time adjustment to a customer’s utility bill for excess water usage when a broken line, leak, or unexplained usage has occurred during the winter months when meters are not read. The customer is required to make a written request within thirty days of mailing of the bill showing excess usage. If the overage is due to a leak, the customer is to provide proof of repair of the leak. The finance director is authorized to waive up to fifty percent of any excess water over what is typically billed to the customer based on a review of the customer’s account. No late fees or penalties shall be incurred by the customer making such request until the customer has been mailed a revised billing and had thirty days to pay the adjusted amount due.

B. Residence rendered uninhabitable by fire or natural disaster. If a single-family residence is destroyed or rendered uninhabitable due to fire or natural disaster and a customer requests water service be temporarily disconnected, the finance director may waive charges for water and/or sewer service, and for the fee for reconnecting water service, for a reasonable time, up to twenty-four months, to allow the customer to repair or reconstruct the single-family residence.

C. The city shall not be held liable for damages caused because of any leakage, frozen pipes, or break along the curbline or on the premises. (Ord. 1563 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 1498 § 1, 2015: Ord. 1457 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1342 § 5, 2007: Ord. 674 § 20, 1980).

The finance director shall collect all the rates and charges provided for and accruing from time to time, and all such sums when collected shall be paid by the finance director into the fund entitled Water and Sewer Revenue Fund. The finance director shall pay from such fund into the Chelan 1947 Water and Sewer Bond Redemption Fund, created by Ordinance 210 of said city, all of the sums required by said ordinance to be paid into such fund at the time or times so required.

All new water connections that are served by the city’s main booster station shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount established by Ordinance 602 and subsequently by resolution of the city council. All funds collected shall be paid into the city’s “Chelan Hills-Gaukroger Water Improvements Fund” and shall only be used for water system improvements benefiting the areas served by this booster station. (Ord. 1563 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 1342 § 1, 2007; Ord. 674 § 21, 1980).


13.12.070 Delinquency – Lien.

All charges for water and sewerage service or connections and all charges for turning water on after the same has been cut off as provided in Section 13.12.080, together with the penalties and interest thereon as provided in this chapter, shall be a lien on the property upon which such connection is made or water delivered or sewerage service rendered respectively, superior to all other liens or encumbrances except those for general taxes and special assessments. Enforcement of such lien or liens shall be in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of the same and for delinquent water and sewerage service charges. (Ord. 1563 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 674 § 22, 1980).

13.20.090 Unfiltered water – Large-scale recreational development.

A. The city council may approve a written agreement to provide a city water service customer with unfiltered and untreated water if the following minimum conditions are met:

1. The water to be provided pursuant to the agreement shall be used for irrigation and temporary construction related purposes associated with large scale recreational development only. Construction purposes may include use of untreated water for dust abatement, erosion control, revegetation, and other uses necessary during project construction. Any other use of water provided by the city pursuant to the agreement is expressly prohibited, including but not limited to agricultural, fire protection, or residential irrigation purposes.

2. All of the land to be served by the city pursuant to the agreement must be located inside of the city limits.

3. The number of acres to be irrigated with untreated water provided by the city is a minimum of fifty acres in size or the annual quantity of water needed for the large scale recreational development exceeds two hundred acre-feet; provided, however, that the instantaneous rate of water delivery and total annual quantity shall be limited in accordance with subsections (A)(4), (A)(5), and (A)(8) of this section.

4. In no event shall the rate of delivery of untreated and unfiltered municipal water exceed thirteen and one-half gallons per minute for every ten acre-feet sought by the applicant.

5. The city engineer has performed an analysis of the city water availability based on the city’s municipal water rights (in terms of instantaneous rate and annual quantity limitations) and city’s water demand and determined that adequate municipal water is available to serve the applicant’s recreational development on an interim basis. For purposes of this analysis, “adequate water” will be considered available where the combined amount of the city’s water demand, as reasonably determined by the city in consultation with its engineer, and the applicant’s proposed use total no more than eighty percent of the city’s existing municipal water rights. The analysis will not include water rights or water demand associated with:

a. City parks, the city-owned golf course, and other city uses that are not part of or connected to the city’s treated water system; and

b. Water rights acquired by the city, transferred to the city or otherwise added to the city’s treated water system after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, unless the city elects to include said water rights as set forth in subsection B of this section. 

The analysis will consider as part of the city’s municipal water demand all previously approved agreements for delivery of untreated and unfiltered water pursuant to this section.

6. The applicant has agreed to reimburse the city for all of the city’s costs associated with the processing of the application for an agreement, the preparation of the agreement, and the delivery of the unfiltered and untreated water to the applicant’s recreational development, including but not limited to any city engineering and legal expenses.

7. The applicant’s use of the city’s water services for irrigation of large scale recreational development as set forth herein will be subject to reduction or suspension in the event of a shortage of water available to the city for municipal purposes, as determined by the city, in its sole discretion. 

8. The agreement between the city and the applicant contains a formula for reduction and/or termination of untreated and unfiltered municipal water delivery in the event the city’s water demand meets or exceeds ninety percent of the amounts allowed under the city’s existing municipal water rights (in terms of either instantaneous demand or annual quantity limitations), as reasonably determined by the city in consultation with its engineer. For purposes of this formula, the “city’s water demand” shall (a) include current demands associated with delivering treated water to city water service customers and city facilities, current demands associated with the delivery of untreated and unfiltered water delivered to customers under previously approved agreements pursuant to this section, and current amounts of untreated and unfiltered water delivered to the applicant, and (b) exclude those water rights and water demand outlined in subsections (A)(5)(a) and (A)(5)(b) of this section. The agreement shall contain a provision requiring the applicant waive any and all claims against the city arising from the reduction or termination of the amount of water being provided pursuant to the agreement. In the event of a reduction or termination as set forth above, the applicant shall be solely responsible for making alternative arrangements to purchase or otherwise obtain other water rights for use on applicant’s property. In the event the extension of the city’s water services is terminated as set forth herein, then the agreement between the city and the applicant shall also terminate and be of no further force or effect between the city and the applicant. Since the extension of the city’s water services pursuant to an agreement is only an interim solution for the applicant, the agreement shall contain a clause requiring the applicant to obtain independent water rights for applicant’s large scale recreational development.

9. The applicant shall install, own, repair, and maintain all piping, pumping and storage facilities associated with the delivery of water pursuant to the agreement. In the event any withdrawal, pumping, or piping facilities currently owned by the city will be used by the applicant, the agreement shall address responsibility for said facilities and the applicant’s financial participation in the repair, maintenance, and replacement of said facilities.

10. The applicant shall install, own, repair and maintain a flow meter at the withdrawal facilities that shall record the instantaneous and totalized flows for the project pursuant to the agreement. Records of maximum instantaneous and totalized flows shall be provided to the city on an annual basis, or as otherwise requested by the city. Annual data shall be provided no later than January 31st of the next year.

11. The application to the city for use of untreated and unfiltered water shall, at a minimum, contain the following information:

a. The legal description of the property on which the water will be used; 

b. A detailed description of the proposed large scale recreational development and the uses to be made of the unfiltered water; 

c. The amount of acres to be irrigated and the total acre-feet sought by the applicant on an annual basis;

d. The rate at which the applicant desires to have water withdrawn from the point of diversion;

e. The proposed point of diversion;

f. The timeline for development; and

g. Such other information reasonably requested by the city to fully evaluate the application. 

12. In the event the proposed point of diversion identified by the applicant is an existing point of diversion for the city’s water rights, then the agreement shall address all costs to be paid by the applicant associated with any modifications to the withdrawal facilities. In the event the proposed point of diversion identified by the applicant is not an existing point of diversion for the city’s water rights, then the agreement shall contain a condition that the applicant is solely responsible for processing a change application to add the proposed point of diversion to the city’s existing water rights. As part of the agreement, the city may impose reasonable mitigation measures to offset any impact to city-owned property or facilities. 

13. The agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions determined by the city, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to address the particular application for use of the city’s unfiltered and untreated municipal water.

14. The agreement between the city and the applicant shall be filed on record at the applicant’s expense and run with the land served by the city water, and be binding upon all subsequent owners of the land. 

B. Any municipal water rights acquired by the city after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section may, in the sole discretion of the city, be included as part of the city’s existing municipal water rights for purposes of subsections (A)(5) and (A)(8) of this section.

C. The written agreement between the city and the applicant for the extension of city unfiltered and untreated water to the applicant’s large scale recreational development as described in subsection A of this section shall include a provision for payment to the city by the applicant based upon water consumption pursuant to rates and charges established by the city in the agreement.

D. The provisions of Title 13 of the Chelan Municipal Code and all other city ordinances, resolutions, and regulations not in conflict with the provisions of this section shall apply to the applicant and the applicant’s property.

E. All applications submitted to the city pursuant to this section shall be processed in the order the applications are received by the city. (Ord. 1315 § 1, 2005).

13.34.010 Purpose.

The city of Chelan and the area surrounding it have greatly expanded in industry, business, housing and population, and it is and has been the policy of the city to encourage this growth in an orderly and responsible manner so as to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare and protect to the greatest degree possible the quality of life of the citizens affected. Realizing that it has been through the extension of water and sewer utility services by the city that expansion has been possible, it is and has been the policy of the city that property to which these utility services are extended ultimately become annexed to the city. This chapter confers upon the city administration all necessary and reasonable authority to carry out this policy. In addition, the city recognizes the need to provide connections to the city sewer system for properties located outside of the urban growth area as the same is defined in the city’s comprehensive plan and as the term is defined in Chapter 36.70A RCW, the Growth Management Act. City sewer services may be extended outside of the city’s urban growth area under the limited circumstances as defined in this chapter. (Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004: Ord. 1244 § 1, 2002: Ord. 1181 § 1 (part), 2000).


13.34.020 Policy – Utility extension – Inside urban growth area.

It is the policy of the city that city utility services be extended to property outside the city’s corporate boundaries, but within the city’s urban growth area, only if such extension is consistent with sound urban planning, and that such properties ultimately be annexed into the city at a time deemed appropriate by the city. (Ord. 1290 § 1, 2004: Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004: Ord. 1244 § 2, 2002: Ord. 1181 § 1 (part), 2000).


13.34.030 Policy – Sewer extension – Outside urban growth area.

It is the policy of the city that city sewer services may be extended to property located outside the city’s corporate boundaries and outside the city’s urban growth area only under the following circumstances:

A. Connections to the city’s sewer service for new subdivisions shall only be allowed for a short or long plat that is completely within six-tenths of one mile of the one-thousand-one-hundred-foot mark of the shoreline of Lake Chelan. Sewer connections shall not be allowed for any short plat or long plat of land outside of the city’s urban growth area when the parcel size of any parcel within the plat is less than two and one-half acres.

B. The city council expressly finds:

1. The extension of sewer utility service is necessary to protect basic public health and safety and the environment;

2. Sewer utility services are financially supportable at rural densities and do not permit urban development; and

3. Extension of the sewer utility service will not adversely impact the capacity of the city’s sewage treatment plant. (Ord. 1290 § 2, 2004: Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004).


13.34.040 Applications for extension of utility services outside the city’s corporate boundaries.

In addition to standard applications for water and/or sewer service, all applications for the extension of utility service outside the city’s corporate boundaries shall provide such other information as may be required by the city including, without limitation, a full description of the current uses and proposed future uses of the property for which the extension of utility service is requested. (Ord. 1290 § 3, 2004: Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004).


13.34.050 Application – Sewer extension – Outside urban growth area.

Repealed by Ord. 1290. (Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004).


13.34.060 Utility extension agreement.

All applicants (an “owner”) for the extension of utility services to property (the “property”) outside the city’s corporate boundaries shall execute a “utility extension agreement” in a form deemed necessary by the city administrator, which conditions the provision of such service on the following terms:

A. Agreement to Run with the Property. The utility extension agreement shall describe the property, shall be recorded with the Chelan County auditor’s office, and shall constitute a covenant running with the property. All covenants and provisions of the utility extension agreement shall bind the owner and all other persons subsequently acquiring any right, title or interest in or to the property.

B. Warranty of Title. The utility extension agreement shall be executed by the owner of the property, who shall warrant that they are authorized to enter into the utility extension agreement.

C. Costs of Design, Engineering and Construction of Extension. The owner shall pay all costs of design, engineering, review, construction and inspection of the extension, which shall be accomplished to city standards and conform to plans approved by the public works director.

D. Capacity Commitment Payments. The owner shall pay for the city’s reservation of sewer and/or water capacity, which is calculated as a percentage of the connection fee for the utility service. Such payments shall be made under the payment schedule determined by the city.

E. Easements and Permits. The owner shall secure and obtain, at the owner’s sole cost and expense, all permits, easements and licenses necessary to construct the extension.

F. Dedication of Capital Facilities. The owner shall dedicate all capital facilities constructed as part of the utility extension, at no cost to the city, upon the completion of construction, approval and acceptance by the city.

G. Connection Charges. The owner shall pay the connection charges set by the city as a condition of connection to the city’s utility services.

H. Agreement Not to Protest Annexation. The owner shall provide the city with an irrevocable power of attorney to allow the city to execute a petition for annexation on behalf of the owner, or the owner shall execute a petition for annexation of the property when requested to do so by the city, and the owner shall not otherwise object to the annexation of the property to the city.

I. Waiver of Right to Protest LID. If, at the time of execution of the utility extension agreement, the city has plans to construct certain improvements that would specially benefit the property, the utility extension agreement shall specifically describe the improvement. The owner shall waive the right to protest the formation of any such LID or ULID, and shall comply with the requirements set out in subsection H of this section regarding annexation.

J. Development of Property to Conform to Codes and Standards. The owner shall comply with all requirements of the city’s comprehensive land use plan, zoning and building codes, and the city’s development standards when developing or redeveloping the property.

K. Termination of Noncompliance. In addition to all other remedies available to the city for the owner’s noncompliance with the terms of the utility extension agreement, the city shall have the ability to disconnect the utility services from the property, and for that purpose may at any time enter upon the property. (Ord. 1290 § 5, 2004: Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004).


13.34.070 Failure of annexation – Reduction of city’s corporate boundaries.

In the event the property that is the subject of an utility extension agreement is not annexed into the city due to a decision by the city to not annex the property, or because the property is located outside the city’s urban growth area, the provisions of the utility extension agreement shall continue in full force and effect, and shall require the property owner or successor in ownership to commence additional annexation petitions at any time as requested by the city. (Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004).


13.34.080 Reduction of the city’s corporate boundaries.

In the event that the property that is the subject of an utility extension agreement is annexed to the city, but then is removed from the city as a result of the reduction of the city’s corporate boundaries (except when initiated by resolution of the city council), the city’s duty to provide utility service to any such property shall cease. (Ord. 1282 § 1 (part), 2004).


13.34.090 Exceptions.

The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the following:

A. The requirement that an application for annexation be made before an extension of utility services is granted shall not apply to water filtration utility services provided by the city to Isenhart Irrigation District and the Chelan River Irrigation Districts, pursuant to a written agreement between said districts and the city, as approved by the city council.

B. To development that occurs within the urban growth area for the city of Manson, as the same exists now or may hereafter be amended.

13.40.010 Purpose and definitions.

The purpose of this chapter is to obtain water rights to support new development within the city’s urban growth area (includes areas within the existing city limits and areas outside the city limits and within the city’s approved urban growth area). This purpose shall be achieved through the transfer of water rights to the city or the payment of fees to the city to be used to acquire additional water rights as a condition of connection to the city’s municipal water system. The purpose for requiring a transfer of water rights or payment in lieu thereof is to enhance the public health, safety, and welfare through a provision designed to enable the city to meet the future water service needs of property within the city’s urban growth area.

For purposes of this chapter, the following defined words shall apply:

An “applicant” shall mean the property owner(s) involved in the action that triggers the transfer of water rights under this chapter, whether that be through annexation in Section 13.40.030 or through a permit or approval process set forth in Section 13.40.040, all as more fully described in this chapter.

A “utility extension” shall mean an extension of domestic water service by an applicant within the meaning of Chapter 13.34 of the Chelan Municipal Code, that triggers the requirement for the applicant to enter into a utility extension agreement with the city before the city will provide water service to the applicant. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).


13.40.020 Types of water rights.

This chapter shall apply to all of the various types of water rights or rights to water that are appurtenant to or associated with the real property that is subject to this chapter (excluding shares in an irrigation district formed pursuant to Chapter 87.03 RCW), and shall include all associated real and personal property interests in and to the water rights at issue. For example, the various types of water rights subject to this chapter include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: permits, certificates, and claims issued by or on file with the Washington State Department of Ecology, or any of its predecessors. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).


13.40.030 Annexations.

Prior to approval of any annexation of land to the city through a petition method of annexation, water rights associated with the property proposed for annexation shall be transferred to the city, subject to the provisions of Section 13.40.080. Alternatively, the city and the applicant may enter into an agreement, at the election of the city, for the transfer to the city of the water rights associated with the annexing property at such future point in time as the city determines appropriate. The purpose of the future transfer provision is to accommodate potential delays encountered in the process to transfer the water rights to the city, the submission of an application within the scope of Section 13.40.040, or continued use of water rights associated with uses in existence at the time of annexation and anticipated to continue until further development of the annexation area property occurs. As part of the agreement, the city may require (A) the applicant to acquire adequate water rights and transfer the same to the city, and/or (B) the applicant to deposit an amount of money into the city water fund not to exceed the payment in lieu of transfer provided in Section 13.40.050, which sum is refundable, without interest, in the event there is a successful transfer of water rights pursuant to the agreement referred to herein. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).


13.40.040 Short plats, subdivisions, binding site plans, planned developments, utility extensions, and other permits.

A. Except as set forth in subsection B of this section, upon application for a short plat, subdivision, binding site plan, planned development, utility extension, or other permit that involves the providing of domestic water service by the city, the applicant shall transfer water rights associated with the property to the city, subject to the provisions in Section 13.40.080. Alternatively, at the election of the city, the applicant and city may enter into an agreement to transfer the water rights to the city at a later time. The purpose of this deferment provision is to accommodate potential delays encountered in the process to transfer the water rights to the city, or the continued use of the water rights associated with uses in existence at the time of the application and anticipated to continue until further development of the property that is the subject of the application. As part of the agreement, the city may require (1) the applicant to acquire adequate water rights and transfer the same to the city, and/or (2) the applicant to deposit an amount of money into the city water fund not to exceed the payment in lieu of transfer provided in Section 13.40.050, which sum is refundable, without interest, in the event there is a successful transfer of water rights pursuant to the agreement referred to herein.

B. An applicant applying for a building permit for a single-family residence is exempt from the requirements to transfer water or make a payment in lieu of transferring water as set forth in this chapter. Upon application for a building permit (except for a single-family residence) on a legal lot of record, the applicant shall transfer water rights consistent with Section 13.40.040 and this chapter, or, alternatively, the city may forego the water right transfer and require a payment in lieu of the water right as set forth in Section 13.40.050.

C. As part of the determination made pursuant to this section, the city shall take into consideration, and may provide appropriate credit to the applicant, if the property identified by the applicant in the action triggering the application of this chapter has previously complied with the provisions of this chapter and (1) water rights associated with said property were previously conveyed to the city, or (2) a payment in lieu was made by the applicant to the city and the funds have not been refunded by the city. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).


13.40.050 Amount of water and payment in lieu.

A. Water Use Determination. The amount of water rights to be transferred to the city pursuant to Sections 13.40.030 and 13.40.040 shall be sufficient to serve the estimated equivalent residential units (“ERUs”) of anticipated water usage for the area that is the subject of the annexation or application based upon the city’s regulations applicable to (or, in the case of an annexation, will be applicable to) development of the property in effect at the time the petition for annexation or the application is submitted. In the event the applicant desires to irrigate common areas, open space, recreational areas, and the like, with water provided through the city’s domestic system, then the water demand for said features shall be converted to ERUs by the public works director (working with the city engineer and the city attorney) for purposes of determining how much additional water the applicant must transfer to the city for said uses. The determination of how much water the city will deliver to the property at issue (expressed in ERUs) shall be made by the public works director (working with the city engineer and city attorney) and the determination communicated in writing to the applicant within forty days of the city’s receipt of a valid petition for annexation triggering Section 13.40.030 or a complete application is received triggering Section 13.40.040. In the case of an annexation or the extension of water service outside of the city limits, in no event shall the ERUs of anticipated water usage be less than the number of ERUs required for development in the R-1 Zoning District. In the calculation of the amount of water rights that must be transferred to the city, credit shall be provided for any existing and previously approved connections to the city’s municipal water system that are currently in use on the subject property. In addition, if the applicant has an exempt well or wells and desires to transfer the water rights associated with said wells, as currently provided for in RCW 90.44.105, then credit shall also be provided for the water use associated with said wells to the extent the water rights associated with said wells are successfully transferred to the city.

B. Excess Water Rights. To the extent the water rights associated with the subject property exceed the anticipated water usage for the subject property as determined pursuant to subsection A of this section, the city and the applicant may agree as follows with respect to any such excess water rights: (1) to transfer any amount of the excess water rights to the city and, in exchange, the city shall pay the applicant for the excess water rights to be transferred to the city an amount of money agreed upon by the city and the applicant or (2) to transfer the excess water rights to the city in exchange for ERU credits associated with water provided through the city’s domestic water system to be applied to other property owned by the applicant within the city’s approved urban growth area, subject to the provisions of this chapter. In the event the excess water rights are transferred to the city, the transfer will be processed simultaneously with and as a part of the transfer process outlined in Section 13.40.080, and the city shall be responsible for the proportionate share of the transfer costs attributable to the excess water rights, as agreed to by the city. The intent of this subsection is to provide the city means to acquire excess water rights that are no longer needed by the applicant.

C. Payment in Lieu. In the event: (1) no water rights are associated with the property that is the subject of a Section 13.40.030 annexation or a Section 13.40.040(A) application; or (2) the water rights associated with said property are less than the public works director (working with the city engineer and city attorney) determines to be sufficient to serve the estimated ERUs of anticipated water usage for the property that is subject to the requirements of this chapter as determined by the public works director pursuant to subsection A of this section; or (3) the water rights successfully transferred to the city are less than the public works director (working with the city engineer and city attorney) determines to be sufficient to serve the estimated ERUs of anticipated water usage for the property that is the subject to the requirements of this chapter as determined by the public works director pursuant to subsection A of this section; or (4) a building permit application is sought (except for a single-family residence) and the city does not require water rights to be transferred as set forth in Section 13.40.040(B), then the city may elect to have the owner(s) of the subject property pay to the city, at the then current market value as determined by the public works director (working with the city engineer and city attorney), a sum of money that represents the current market value of the water rights the city estimates will be necessary to serve the property as determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection A of this section.

D. Payment of Costs. The applicant shall pay the city for all costs associated with (1) the city’s determination and evaluation of the anticipated water demand and usage for the subject property and, if determined to be necessary by the city, the current market value of an ERU of water, and (2) completing the transfer of the water rights to the city consistent with this chapter. If the applicant is making a payment to the city in lieu of transferring water rights to the city, then the applicant shall also pay the city’s estimated costs of processing the future transfer and acquisition of the water rights. The term “costs” as used in this subsection shall include, but is not limited to, city staff time, engineering fees, attorneys’ fees, application fees, Chelan County water conservancy board fees, publication fees, and any other fees or charges associated with processing and recording the transfer and acquisition of water rights.

E. Commitment by City. Effective upon the date the water rights are successfully transferred and conveyed to the city as required by this chapter and for a period of ten years thereafter, the city shall make available to the property that was subject to the application of this chapter, water usage in amounts at least equal to the amount of water usage transferred to the city by the applicant. The requirement of the city to make available this water usage shall not be construed to require the city to construct any city water system extensions or improvements that may be necessary to serve said property or the applicant. Any such city water system extensions or improvements shall be constructed by the owner of said property at the owner’s expense. Nothing herein precludes the city from making commitments to provide municipal water service as part of an annexation agreement, when the owner of property subject to the annexation is required to pay some sum to the city as set forth in subsection C of this section. In the event (1) a building permit is denied solely because of water unavailability, and (2) the property for which said building permit is sought was previously subject to the provisions of this chapter resulting in a transfer and conveyance of water rights or the payment in lieu thereof to the city (which payment has not been refunded by the city), then the party seeking the building permit, as the sole and exclusive remedy, shall receive a payment equal to the ERU(s) originally attributed to the property identified in the building permit at the value established at the time of the original application (all as determined by the public works director), without interest from the date of the original application.

F. Appeal. Any decision committed to the public works director will be reviewed by the city administrator; provided the affected applicant serves a written notice to the city requesting the review within fourteen calendar days of the issuance of the written recommendation of the public works director. If a written notice requesting review is not timely served upon the city, then the public works director’s recommendation shall be the final decision of the city. If a written notice requesting review is timely served on the city, the city administrator shall review the recommendation of the public works director and issue a final decision within twenty calendar days of the service of the notice requesting review on the city. Any final decision within the limited scope of this subsection may be appealed for abuse of discretion by filing an appeal in the Chelan County superior court within twenty-one calendar days of the date of the final decision. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).


13.40.060 Payments made by the city.

All money paid by the city to owners pursuant to the application of this chapter shall be paid by the city water fund. Those water rights purchased pursuant to this chapter shall become assets of the city domestic water utility and part of the city’s water system. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).


13.40.070 Payments received by the city.

All money paid to the city pursuant to this chapter shall be paid to the city water fund. All money paid to the city pursuant to this chapter shall be used by the city water utility for the following purposes: (A) purchase of water rights and to process applications for new water rights for the city to be added to the city domestic water utility system; and (B) alternatively, to the extent permitted by the laws of the state of Washington, the city may, but is not required to, use the money deposited into the city water fund pursuant to this chapter to finance water conservation measures that enhance the city’s municipal water system effectiveness. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).


13.40.080 Form of transfer and conveyance of water right.

The transfer of water rights pursuant to this chapter shall be in such forms as may be approved by the city. The applicant shall execute all documents required by the city and/or any other governmental entity that may be necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. Those documents may include, but are not limited to, change in point of diversion, change in place of use, change in purpose of use, and any other documents or forms. The city will diligently pursue approval of the water right transfer. In order for a water right transfer to be completed, the water right transfer must (A) ultimately be approved by the Department of Ecology and all appeal periods must have expired without challenge, and (B) be changed to a municipal water right. The applicant must convey the water right to the city by statutory warranty deed or other appropriate conveyance instrument, as determined by the city, upon completion of the water right transfer; provided, however, that the actual conveyance may be delayed to coincide with the city’s approval of the petition for annexation or application described in this chapter, or as otherwise set forth in an agreement between the applicant and the city. (Ord. 1362 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1322 § 1 (part), 2006).

(Ord. 1139 § 2 (part), 1999).


14.06.060 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.

A. The responsible official shall determine whether the city will be the lead agency for all projects, applications, and proposals involving SEPA review.

B. When the city is not the lead agency, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency unless the city determines a supplemental environmental review is necessary under WAC 197-11-600.

C. If the responsible official receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or WAC 197-11-922 through WAC 197-11-940, he or she may object to the determination with the agency which made the determination. If the objection is not resolved within fourteen days of receipt of the determination, the responsible official shall petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946.

If the SEPA and MTCA documents are issued together with one public comment period under WAC 197-11-253(6), the city shall decide jointly with the Department of Ecology which agency receives the comment letters and how copies of the comment letters will be distributed to the other agency.

G. For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the city’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. A state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority list in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal.

H. The responsible official shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify other agencies with jurisdiction. (Ord. 1139 § 2 (part), 1999).

B. Environmental Checklist Not Needed. A checklist is not needed if the city and the applicant agree that an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency.

C. Environmental Checklist to Determine Lead Agency. The responsible official shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency for making the threshold determination.

D. Completing Environmental Checklist. For private proposals, the applicant is required to complete the environmental checklist. The city may provide assistance as may be reasonably necessary. For city proposals the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

E. The responsible official shall use the environmental checklist substantially in the form found in WAC 197-11-960 to assist in making threshold determinations for proposals, except for:

1. Public proposals on which the lead agency has decided to prepare its own EIS;

2. Proposals on which the lead agency and applicant agree an EIS will be prepared; and

3. Projects which are proposed as planned actions, which shall be governed by the requirements of WAC 197-11-315(2).

F. For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197- 11- 164, the city shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with or as part of a planned action ordinance; or developed after the ordinance is adopted. In either case, a proposed modified environmental checklist form must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a thirty-day review prior to use. (Ord. 1139 § 2 (part), 1999).


14.06.140 Threshold determination –Reliance on plans, laws and regulations.

A. The responsible official, in reviewing the environmental impacts of a project and making the threshold determination, shall determine that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection and mitigation measures in the city’s comprehensive plan and development regulations adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, and in other applicable local, state or federal laws or rules provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for some or all of the specific adverse environmental impacts of the project. In conducting this review the responsible official shall:

1. Determine whether applicable regulations require studies that adequately analyze all of the project application’s specific probable adverse environmental impacts;

2. Determine whether applicable regulations require measures that adequately address such environmental impacts;

3. Determine whether additional studies are required and/or whether the project permit application should be conditioned with additional mitigation measures;

4. Provide prompt and coordinated review by government agencies and the public on compliance with applicable environmental laws and plans, including mitigation for specific project impacts that have not been considered and addressed at the plan or development regulation level;

5. Review and document consistency with the comprehensive plan and land use code development regulations; and

6. Consult the procedures set forth in WAC 197-11-158.

B. In its review of a project permit application, the city may determine, pursuant to the criteria of RCW 43.21C.240(1) and (2), the requirements for environmental analysis, protection and mitigation measures in the applicable development regulations, comprehensive plan and/or in other applicable local, state or federal laws provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the application.

C. If the city’s comprehensive plan and development regulations adequately address a project’s probable specific adverse environmental impacts, as determined under subsection (D)(1) of this section, or RCW 43.21C.240(1) and (2), the city shall not impose additional mitigation under SEPA during project review.

D. A comprehensive plan, development regulation or other applicable local, state or federal law provides adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of an application when: 

1. The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; and

2. The city has designated as acceptable certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards or other land use planning required or allowed by Chapter 36.70A RCW.

E. In its decision whether a specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or law of another agency with jurisdiction with environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the city shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. In making this deferral, the city shall base or condition its project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws.

F. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city in its review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analyses and requirements under other laws, as provided in Chapter 43.21C RCW. (Ord. 1139 § 2 (part), 1999).


14.06.150 Threshold determination – Mitigated DNS.

A. As provided in this section and WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official, or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

1. Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the city is lead agency.

2. Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C. The responsible official’s written response to the request for early notice shall:

1. State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific areas of concern that are leading the city to consider a DS.

2. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, and may revise the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal:

1. If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS if the city determines that no additional information or mitigation measures are required.

2. If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures, clarifications, changes, or conditions must be in writing and must be specific.

4. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies, or other documents.

E. A mitigated DNS is issued under either WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a fourteen-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355, which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application. If the mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), the city shall not act upon a proposal for which a mitigated DNS has been issued for fourteen days after the date of issuance.

F. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any matter specifically prescribed by the city. Failure to comply with the designated mitigation measures shall be grounds for suspension and/or revocation of any permit issued.

G. If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) relating to the withdrawal of a DNS.

H. The city’s response under subsection C of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 1139 § 2 (part), 1999).


14.06.160 Optional DNS process.

A. If the responsible official has a reasonable basis for determining that significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely, the responsible official may elect to use the single integrated comment period to obtain comments on the notice of application and the likely threshold determination for the proposal as set forth in this section. If this process is used, a second comment period will typically not be required when the DNS is issued.

B. If the optional process set forth in this section is used, the responsible official shall:

1. State on the first page of the notice of application that it expects to issue a DNS for the proposal, and that:

a. The optional DNS process is being used;

b. This may be the only opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the proposal;

c. The proposal may include mitigation measures under applicable codes, and the project review process may incorporate or require mitigation measures regardless of whether an EIS is prepared; and

d. A copy of the subsequent threshold determination for the specific proposal may be obtained upon request (in addition, the city may choose to maintain a general mailing list for threshold determination distribution).

2. List in the notice of application the conditions being considered to mitigate environmental impacts, if a mitigated DNS is expected.

3. Comply with the requirements for a notice of application and public notice in RCW 36.70B.110, as set forth in Title 19 of this code.

4. Send the notice of application and environmental checklist to:

a. Agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal; and

b. Anyone requesting a copy of the environmental checklist for the specific proposal (in addition, the city may choose to maintain a general mailing list for checklist distribution).

C. If the responsible official indicates on the notice of application that a DNS is likely, an agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status during the comment period on the notice of application in accordance with Section 14.06.060 of this code and WAC 197-11-948.

D. The responsible official shall consider timely comments on the notice of application and either:

1. Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with no comment period using the procedures in subsection E of this section;

2. Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with a comment period using the procedures in subsection E of this section, if the responsible official determines a comment period is necessary;

3. Issue a DS; or

4. Require additional information or studies prior to making a threshold determination.

E. If a DNS or mitigated DNS is issued under subsection (D)(1) or (D)(2) above, the responsible official shall send a copy of the DNS or mitigated DNS to the Department of Ecology, agencies with jurisdiction, those who commented, and anyone requesting a copy. A copy of the environmental checklist need not be recirculated. (Ord. 1139 § 2 (part), 1999).

The purpose of this chapter is to comply with the provisions of the Washington State Growth Management Act of 1990, Chapter 17, Chapter 36.70A RCW, as amended, to supplement the development requirements contained in the Chelan Municipal Code, and to establish special standards for the use and development of lands based on the existence of critical areas including critical aquifer recharge areas, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, frequently flooded areas, geologically hazardous areas, and wetlands. Those critical areas are of special concern to the city. The standards and procedures established in this chapter are intended to protect critical areas and the public health, safety, and welfare by preventing the adverse impacts of development listed in this section while accommodating the rights of property owners to reasonable use of their property. By regulating development and alterations to critical areas this chapter seeks to:

A. Protect members of the public and public and private resources and facilities from injury, loss of life, property damage or financial losses due to flooding, erosion, landslide, seismic events or steep slope failure;

B. Protect unique fragile and valuable elements of the environment, including ravines and wetlands;

C. Mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to those areas;

D. Provide city officials with the information and authority to protect critical areas and implement the policies of the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW, the city of Chelan comprehensive plan, and the Growth Management Act of 1990. (Ord. 1397 § 7 (Exh. 6) (part), 2009: Ord. 944 § 1 (part), 1992).


14.10.020 Definitions.

When used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings unless the context indicates otherwise:

“Administrator” means the planning director or his or her designee.

“Alteration” means any human-induced action that changes the existing condition of a critical area. Alterations include, but are not limited to: grading; filling; dredging; draining; channelizing; discharging pollutants except stormwater; paving, construction, application of gravel; modifying for surface water management purposes; vegetation removal or any other human activity that changes the existing landforms, vegetation, hydrology, wildlife or wildlife habitat of a critical area.

“Geotechnical engineer” is a person with a Washington State license in civil engineering who has at least four years of professional employment as a geotechnical engineer with experience in landslide, erosion and seismic hazards identification and mitigation.

“Geotechnical report” means a report that evaluates the site conditions and mitigating measures necessary to ensure that the risks associated with geologic hazards are eliminated on the site proposed to be altered. The geotechnical report shall be prepared by either an engineering geologist licensed by the state of Washington or a professional civil engineer licensed by the state of Washington. A civil engineer must also have four years of geotechnical experience evaluating geologically hazardous conditions and site development activities, such as landform recognition; unstable geologic units; roads; structural footings, foundations and retaining walls; swimming pools and sport courts; and other activities such as timber removal, site disturbance and mining.

“Hydrogeologic evaluation” means a systematic study of geologic and ground water resources, focusing on near-surface geologic, ground water, and pollution sensitivity, for the purpose of determining any potential risk to human health, ground water quality, and the environment. The hydrogeologic report shall be prepared by a hydrogeologist licensed by the state of Washington.

“Intermittent stream” means a stream that flows for only part of the year, including streams that flow for only hours or days after significant rainfall or during snowmelt.

“Landslide hazard areas” means areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), aspect, structure, hydrology or other factors. The landslide hazard area includes areas that would be affected by landslide runout or concurrent debris flows.

•    A qualified professional for geological hazards must be an engineering geologist, geologist or engineer licensed in the state of Washington, with experience evaluating the type of geologic hazard known or suspected to occur at the subject site.

•    A qualified professional for aquifer recharge areas must be a hydrogeologist, geologist or engineer licensed in the state of Washington, with experience in preparing hydrogeologic evaluations.

“Ravine” means a steep-sided valley of a stream (whether perennial or intermittent) created by the wearing action of the stream and includes the sidewalls and the valley between the sidewalls.

“Ravine channel” means the area along a ravine including its channel, sidewalls, and adjacent hillside. A ravine channel has a minimum width of two hundred feet, centered on the ravine stream channel. Where the top of ravine is more than one hundred feet from the stream, the border of the ravine channel is fifty feet from the top of ravine. The top of ravine is defined as the abrupt break in slope of a ravine sidewall where the sidewall meets the surrounding hillside. The top of ravine also exhibits the boundary between little or no soil cover on the ravine sidewall and deeper soil profile of the surrounding hillside.

“Ravine sidewall area” means that portion of a ravine that abuts and rises from the ravine valley floor. Ravine sidewalls contain slopes predominantly in excess of forty percent, although portions may be less than forty percent. The toe of a ravine sidewall is the stream valley floor. The top of a ravine sidewall is typically a distinct line where the slope abruptly levels out. Where there is no distinct break in slope, the top is where the slope diminishes to less than twenty percent. Minor natural or manmade breaks in the slope of ravine sidewalls shall not be considered as the top. Benches with slopes less than twenty percent and containing developed or developable areas shall be considered as the top.

“Regulated wetland” means a wetland designated in this chapter.

“Seismic hazard area” means any area subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake-induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, or surface faulting.

“Slope,” when used as a noun, means an inclined ground surface, the inclination of which is expressed as a ratio (percentage) of vertical distance to horizontal distance by the following formula: y1-y2/x1-x2, where y1 and y2 are points on the vertical axis and x1 and x2 are points on the horizontal axis.

“Steep slope area” means any area in the city or its UGA in which slopes measure thirty percent or greater over a vertical distance of at least ten feet. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least ten feet of vertical distance.

“Streams” are surface water contained within a defined bed or channel, whether permanent or intermittent. This definition does not include ditches, canals, stormwater runoff devices or other entirely artificial watercourses. A stream which has been altered to carry naturally occurring waters is a stream within this definition.

“Wetland(s)” or “wetland areas” means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support (and that under normal circumstances do support) a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

3. This chapter shall not alter the city’s responsibility for the enforcement of the State Environmental Policy Act or the International Building Code.

B. General Exemptions. The activities listed below are exempt from the provisions of this chapter. Exempt activities shall be conducted using all reasonable methods to avoid impacts to critical areas. The decision to declare an activity exempt shall be a Type IB procedure, subject to Title 19. Exemption from this chapter shall not be considered permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risks from natural hazards. Incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity shall be restored or rehabilitated at the responsible party’s expense. Applications for any development proposals submitted to the city and accepted as complete prior to the date of approval of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall also be exempt from the provisions of this chapter. Such proposals may be subject to other applicable codes of the city, state or federal government. The provisions of this chapter and any administrative rules promulgated hereunder shall not apply to the following:

1. Emergencies that threaten the public health, safety or welfare or the environment; provided, that once the immediate threat has been addressed, the actions undertaken as a result of the emergency shall be subject to and brought into full compliance with these regulations and any adverse impacts on critical areas shall be mitigated;

2. Maintenance and repair of structures and developments lawfully existing prior to the adoption of this chapter. “Maintenance” consists of usual actions necessary to prevent a decline, lapse or cessation from a lawfully established condition. “Repair” consists of the restoration of a development comparable to its original condition within two years of sustaining damage or partial destruction; provided, that the maintenance or repair activity remains consistent with the provisions of this chapter and does not increase its nonconformity. This exemption is limited to activity that does not intrude further into the critical area or its buffer and does not increase the potential impact to the critical area or to public safety, health, or welfare (including any increase in the potential of soil movement or risk of harm or damage to existing uses or development, or the public safety);

3. Normal and routine maintenance or repair of existing buildings, structures, roads, utilities, levees, or drainage or irrigation systems, provided the activity does not further alter, encroach upon, or increase impacts to critical areas or associated buffers;

4. Agricultural activities in existence on May 11, 1992. This includes the grazing of livestock; mowing of hay, grass or grain; and tilling, discing, planting, seeding, harvesting and related activities for pasture, food crops, grass seed or sod; provided, that such activities do not involve any expansion into the critical area or its buffer;

5. Site investigative work necessary for land use application submittals such as surveys, soil logs, test pits, percolation tests and other related activities. In every case, critical area impacts shall be minimized and disturbed areas shall be immediately restored to conditions that are equivalent to undisturbed conditions;

6. Education, scientific research, and passive recreational activities, including, but not limited to: fishing, bird watching, hiking, hunting, boating, horseback riding, skiing, swimming, canoeing, and bicycling, within critical areas and their buffers, provided the activity does not alter the function of the critical area or its buffers, or increase risk to life or property. This exemption also applies to associated facilities (e.g., benches, trash receptacles, interpretive signs) provided they are located so that they will not interfere with the function of the critical area or its buffer or create a significant disturbance to vegetation; and

7. Forest practices regulated by the state of Washington.

C. Public Agency and Utility Exception.

1. If application of this title would prohibit development or other alteration by a public agency or public utility, the agency or utility may apply for an exception pursuant to this section. To qualify for an exception the agency or utility must demonstrate that:

a. There is no other practical alternative to the proposed development which has less impact on critical areas;

b. The application of this title would unreasonably restrict the ability to provide utility services to the public;

c. The proposed use does not pose a threat to the public health, safety or welfare;

d. The proposal protects critical area functions and values to the extent feasible and provides for mitigation in accord with the provisions of this title; and

e. The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.

2. Where a permit is required, a request for exception shall be submitted to the city with the permit application materials. Whether or not a permit is required, the request shall be supplemented with an explanation as to how the public agency and utility exception criteria are satisfied. The administrator may require additional information or studies to supplement the exception request.

3. A public agency and utility exception shall be processed according to the provisions of Title 19, Administration of Development Regulations, governing a Type IB review process.

D. Reasonable Use Exception.

1. If the application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the subject property, development or other alteration that is consistent with the current zoning of the development site, the general purposes of this chapter, and the public interest may be allowed; provided, that the hearing examiner after a public hearing finds that:

a. This chapter would otherwise deny any reasonable use of the property that would have been permitted prior to adoption of this chapter; and

b. There is no other reasonable use with less impact on the critical area; and

c. The proposal does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety or welfare, on or off the property; and

d. The inability of the proponent to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of actions taken after the effective date of this chapter; and

e. Any proposed alteration of the critical area or its buffer is the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property; and

f. No other reasonable use can be made of the property that will have a lesser adverse impact on the critical area and adjoining and neighboring lands; and

g. Any alteration is the minimum necessary to allow reasonable use of the property.

2. Where a permit is required, a request for a reasonable use exception shall be submitted to the city with the permit application materials. Whether or not a permit is required, the request shall be supplemented with an explanation as to how the reasonable use exception criteria are satisfied. The city may require additional information or studies to supplement the reasonable use exception request.

3. Where a request for a reasonable use exception is granted, impacts to critical areas and buffers shall be mitigated consistent with the purpose and standards of this chapter to the greatest extent feasible.

4. A reasonable use exception shall be processed according to the provisions of Title 19, Administration of Development Regulations, governing a Type IB review process.

E. Reference Maps and Materials. The city shall maintain reference maps and materials that provide information on the general locations of critical areas and their functions and values. Since boundaries are generalized, the application of this chapter and the actual type, extent, and boundaries of critical areas shall be determined and governed by the designation and classification sections for each critical area. In the event of any conflict between the maps and the provisions of this chapter or the site-specific conditions, the provisions and/or site-specific conditions shall prevail. Reference materials shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following (or, where applicable, any subsequent or amended version):

The city shall maintain a generalized critical areas map and other reference materials, per subsection E of this section, which may be used to locate known and potential critical areas. The city shall make the reference materials available for reference in the city offices and on the city website.

2. Preliminary Evaluation. Submittal of a critical areas review checklist shall be required prior to any development or other alteration in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a known or potential critical area, whether or not a permit is required for such an alteration. The application for any development proposal for which a permit is required shall include submittal of a checklist by the applicant and completion of the checklist by city staff. Each checklist shall indicate whether any critical area(s) is located on the site. Said checklist shall be provided by the city. The first page shall be completed by the applicant and shall provide the administrator with the information necessary for the preliminary evaluation of the proposed alteration.

3. On receipt of a critical areas review checklist, the administrator shall conduct a preliminary evaluation, which shall include visiting the site and reviewing the following information:

a. Any pertinent information provided by the applicant;

b. The city’s generalized critical areas map and other relevant reference materials; and

c. Any other pertinent information including but not limited to the information on the critical areas review checklist and (when required) a SEPA checklist.

Based on the preliminary evaluation, the administrator shall determine whether or not sufficient information is available to evaluate the proposal.

4. If the administrator determines that the information presented is not sufficient to adequately evaluate the impact on critical areas of a proposed alteration, he or she shall notify the applicant that a critical area study is required. In the event that multiple critical areas occur on a given site, each critical area shall be addressed independently and all critical areas shall be addressed collectively for the purpose of determining development standards and appropriate mitigating measures.

5. In the case of landslide or erosion hazard areas, should the applicant question the presence of such areas on the site, the applicant may submit a geotechnical assessment prepared by a qualified professional for geological hazards. If the geotechnical assessment demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the administrator, that the proposed site is not located in any landslide or erosion hazard area, then the requirements of this chapter shall not apply. The geotechnical assessment shall include at a minimum the following:

a. A discussion of the surface and subsurface geologic conditions of the site;

b. A site plan of the area delineating all areas of the site subject to landslide and erosion hazards based on mapping and criteria referenced in this section. A map meeting the criteria set forth for a geotechnical report shall be included.

G. Vegetation Removal.

1. Critical areas review is required prior to removal of any vegetation, including nonnative vegetation, from a critical area or its buffer, whether or not development is proposed or a development permit is being sought. This provision applies to noxious weeds and invasive plant species, with the exception of hand removal or spot-spraying. If the administrator determines, based on a preliminary evaluation, that a critical area study is required, such removal of vegetation shall be incorporated in a mitigation plan designed to prevent erosion and facilitate establishment of a stable community of native plants. In all cases, including spot-spraying of noxious weeds and invasive plant species, any herbicide use must conform to all applicable laws, including labeling laws.

2. Unauthorized Vegetation Removal. Vegetation removal conducted without the appropriate review and approvals shall be mitigated in conformance with an approved mitigation plan meeting the standards of this chapter.

H. Critical Area Study. If the administrator determines that the site of a proposed development includes, is likely to include, or is adjacent to one or more critical areas, a critical area study may be required. When required, the expense of preparing the critical area study shall be borne by the applicant. The content, format and extent of the critical area study shall be approved by the administrator.

1. The requirement for a critical area study may be waived by the administrator if there is substantial evidence that:

a. There will be no alteration of the critical area(s) and/or the required buffer(s); and

b. The proposal will not impact the critical area(s) in a manner contrary to the purpose, intent and requirements of this chapter and the city’s comprehensive plan; and

c. The minimum standards of this chapter will be met.

2. No critical area study is required for proposals that are exempt from the provisions of this chapter as set forth under subsection B of this section, General Exemptions.

3. Every critical area study shall be completed by a qualified professional who is knowledgeable about the specific critical area(s) in question, and approved by the administrator.

4. At a minimum, a required critical area study shall contain the following information:

a. Applicant’s name and contact information; permits being sought; and description of the proposal;

b. A copy of the site plan for the alteration proposal, drawn to scale and showing:

i. Identified critical areas, buffers, and the proposed alteration with dimensions;

iii. A description of the proposed stormwater management plan and any other plans that could affect surface hydrology or ground water infiltration for the development and consideration of impacts to drainage alterations and slope stability;

c. The names and qualifications of the persons preparing the report and documentation of any fieldwork performed on the site;

d. Identification and characterization of all critical areas within, or within two hundred and fifty feet of, the project area or within any proposed buffer;

e. An assessment of the probable cumulative impacts to critical areas resulting from the proposed development of the site;

f. An analysis of site development alternatives;

g. A description of reasonable efforts made to apply mitigation sequencing, as defined in these regulations, to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to critical areas;

h. A mitigation plan as set forth in subsection (J)(3) of this section;

i. A discussion of the performance standards proposed to ensure that ecological functions of critical areas are protected and health and safety hazards associated with critical areas are precluded;

j. Financial guarantees proposed to ensure compliance with mitigation plan and performance standards; and

k. Any additional information required for specific critical areas as listed in subsequent sections of these regulations.

5. The administrator may request any other information reasonably deemed necessary to understand impacts to critical areas.

I. Development Standards.

1. Upon review of the critical area study, the administrator may require compliance with all or part of the development standards listed in this chapter. At a minimum, the administrator shall require that development mitigate any impacts that degrade the functions and values of critical areas in accordance with the mitigation provisions in subsection J of this section.

2. The administrator shall waive all or part of the development standards required by this chapter if he or she determines that the potential impact of the proposal (including impact on critical areas and impact on the public health, safety, and welfare) and the protection measures proposed have been previously reviewed pursuant to this chapter under separate application and that an adequate degree of protection has been provided.

J. Mitigation Requirements.

1. The applicant shall avoid all impacts that degrade the functions and values of critical areas. If alteration is unavoidable, all adverse impacts to critical areas and buffers resulting from the proposal shall be mitigated in accordance with an approved critical areas report and SEPA documents. The location of the mitigation site shall be consistent with best available science and may be on site or off site.

2. Mitigation Sequencing. Applicants shall use the least intrusive type of mitigation feasible, and shall demonstrate that less intrusive types of mitigation have been evaluated. The types of mitigation, from least to most intrusive, are:

a. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

b. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps (such as project redesign, relocation, or timing) to avoid or reduce impacts;

c. In the case of frequently flooded areas and geologically hazardous areas, minimizing or eliminating the hazard by restoring or stabilizing the hazard area through engineered methods or other methods designed by a qualified design professional;

d. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment to historic conditions or the conditions existing at the time the project was initiated;

e. Reducing or eliminating the impact or hazard over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

f. In the case of critical aquifer recharge areas, frequently flooded areas, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, and wetlands, compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and

g. Monitoring the impact using a planned evaluation process and taking appropriate corrective measures.

3. Mitigation Plan. When mitigation is required, the applicant shall submit for approval a mitigation plan as part of the critical area study. Mitigation plans shall be prepared by a qualified professional and shall be consistent with the relevant impacts indicated during mitigation sequencing. Mitigation measures specified in the mitigation plan shall be maintained over the life of the use and/or development. Approval of a mitigation plan shall be a Type IB procedure, subject to Title 19. The mitigation plan shall include a written report identifying:

a. Mitigation objectives, including:

i. A description of the anticipated impacts to critical areas and their buffers, the type or types of mitigation proposed, and the purposes of the measures proposed, including site selection criteria; identification of compensation objectives; identification of critical area functions and values; and dates for beginning and completion of any on-site mitigation activities;

ii. The impacts of any proposed alteration of a critical area or buffer, including proposed mitigation activities, on the development site, other properties and the environment;

iii. A review of the best available science supporting the proposed mitigation and a description of the report author’s experience to date in critical areas mitigation; and

iv. An analysis of the likelihood of success of the proposed mitigation.

b. Measurable criteria for evaluating whether or not the objectives of the mitigation plan have been successfully attained and whether or not the requirements of these regulations have been met. For any vegetation components of mitigation, mitigation plans shall include a performance standard of one hundred percent survival for the first year of growth post installation, with no less than eighty percent survival at the end of the third year and fifth year.

c. Descriptions and specifications for any on-the-ground mitigation activities, including, but not limited to:

i. Proposed construction sequence, timing, and duration;

ii. Grading and excavation details;

iii. Erosion and sediment control measures;

iv. A planting plan specifying plant species, quantities, locations, sizes, and spacing; and

v. Measures to protect and maintain plants until established.

d. Where on-the-ground mitigation activities are proposed, construction and post-construction monitoring programs.

i. The purpose of the construction monitoring program is to monitor adherence to the mitigation specifications and any other requirements of these regulations.

ii. The purpose of the post-construction monitoring program is to determine whether mitigation objectives are being achieved and, if not, prescribe corrective measures. The program shall include a schedule for monitoring the project over a period adequate to establish that mitigation objectives have been met, generally at least five years from completion of the mitigation project, and shall describe the methods to be used in monitoring.

e. A list of potential corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates project objectives are not being achieved.

4. Monitoring and Reporting. The mitigation project shall include a five-year monitoring plan, or other monitoring time frame specified by local, state or federal permitting agencies, and scaled drawings of existing and proposed conditions. A monitoring report shall be submitted by the project proponent to the administrator according to the schedule specified in the mitigation plan, to document monitoring outcomes and any contingency actions. Monitoring reports associated with single-family residential development may be prepared by the property owner or applicant at the end of years one, three and five; provided, that the report fully addresses the performance standards and any other maintenance requirements prescribed by the mitigation plan, and provides as-built plans and comprehensive photo documentation. The city has the right to request that property owners and applicants hire a qualified professional to prepare the report if it is not adequate.

K. Surety/Bonding. If a development proposal is subject to mitigation, maintenance, or monitoring plans, the city may require an assurance device or surety, in a form acceptable to the city attorney. (Ord. 1533 § 6 (Exh. 5) (part), 2017: Ord. 1397 § 7 (Exh. 6) (part), 2009: Ord. 952 § 2, 1992; Ord. 944 § 1 (part), 1992).


14.10.050 Appeal from decisions.

A. The administrator’s decision to approve, condition or deny a proposed alteration based on this chapter, unless otherwise specifically provided by ordinance, may be appealed to the city hearing examiner. Any appeal shall be in writing and submitted within ten days of the date of the city’s decision. The provisions of Chapter 19.06 shall govern the appeal procedure.

B. Any decision of the hearing examiner regarding the reasonable use exception or a decision of the administrator, unless otherwise specifically provided by ordinance, shall be final. There shall be no further appeal to any other municipal board, officer, or the legislative authority of the city. Unless otherwise specifically provided by ordinance, any board decision shall be reviewable for unlawful, arbitrary, capricious or corrupt action or nonaction by writ of review before the Chelan County superior court; provided, that the application for writ of review shall be made to the court within ten days from any decision so to be reviewed. The costs of transcription of all records ordered certified by the court for such review shall be borne by the applicant at the rate prescribed by the administrator of this title. Such costs shall not exceed the amount necessary to reimburse the city for its expenses actually incurred. (Ord. 1397 § 7 (Exh. 6) (part), 2009: Ord. 944 § 1 (part), 1992).


14.10.060 Designation, classification, and protection.

 A. Wetlands.

1. Designation. Wetlands in Chelan shall be designated according to the definition of wetlands in RCW 36.70A.030(21). Wetlands meeting the criteria of that definition shall be subject to these critical areas regulations.

2. Classification. Wetlands shall be classified according to the Washington State Wetlands Rating System for Eastern Washington (Department of Ecology Publication No. 14-06-30, or as amended). Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the regulated wetland exists on the date of the adoption or revision of the rating system by the Department of Ecology. As of the date of this writing, the rating system includes the following four categories:

a. Category I. Generally, such wetlands are not common and make up a small percentage of the wetlands in Eastern Washington. Category I wetlands include alkali wetlands, bogs and calcareous fens, wetlands with high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Natural Heritage Program/DNR, mature and old-growth forested wetlands over one-quarter acre with slow-growing trees, forested wetlands with stands of aspen, and wetlands that perform many functions well, as measured by the rating system (scores between twenty-two and twenty-seven points). Category I wetlands are those that:

i. Represent a unique or rare wetland type;

ii. Are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands;

iii. Are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or

iv. Provide a high level of functions.

b. Category II. Such wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace. They provide high levels of some functions. Category II wetlands occur more commonly than Category I wetlands, but still need a high level of protection. Category II wetlands are:

i. Forested wetlands in the channel migration zone of rivers;

ii. Mature and old-growth forested wetlands over one-quarter acre containing fast-growing trees;

iii. Vernal pools; or

iv. Those wetlands that perform functions well, as measured by the rating system (scores between nineteen and twenty-one points).

c. Category III. Such wetlands have generally been disturbed in some manner, and are often less diverse and/or more isolated in the landscape than Category II wetlands. They may not require as much protection as Category I and II wetlands. Category III wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions, as measured by the rating system (scores between sixteen and eighteen points).

d. Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions, as measured by the rating system (scores fewer than sixteen points), and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that we should be able to replace, and in some cases improve. These wetlands do provide some important functions, and should be afforded some degree of protection.

3. Critical Areas Review.

a. Preliminary Evaluation.

i. A preliminary evaluation shall evaluate known or potential wetlands on or within three hundred feet of the site of a proposed alteration.

ii. At a minimum, the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) maps, the city’s generalized critical areas map, and any critical areas study that identifies wetlands in the vicinity of a development site shall be used in completing a critical areas checklist and in the city’s review for the purpose of determining whether a critical areas study will be required.

b. Identification and Delineation. Wetlands in shoreline jurisdiction shall be delineated using the procedure outlined in the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements.

c. In addition to the general requirements for critical area studies, the required critical area study for any wetland shall include the following:

i. An overview of the methodology used to conduct the study;

ii. As part of the identification and characterization, a written assessment and accompanying maps of the wetlands and buffers within three hundred feet of the project area, including the following information at a minimum:

(A) Wetland delineation and required buffers;

(B) Existing wetland acreage;

(C) Wetland category;

(D) Vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic characteristics;

(E) Soil and substrate conditions;

(F) Topographic elevations, at two-foot contours; and

(G) A discussion of the water sources supplying the wetland and documentation of hydrologic regime (locations of inlet and outlet features, water depths throughout the wetland, evidence of recharge or discharge, evidence of water depths throughout the year such as algal layers and sediment deposits).

iii. As part of the mitigation plan, a habitat and native vegetation conservation strategy that addresses methods to protect and enhance on-site habitat and wetland functions, including the following information at a minimum:

(A) Any proposed changes in wetland acreage;

(B) Any proposed changes in vegetation and fauna;

(C) Any proposed changes in surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions including an analysis of existing and future hydrologic regime, and proposed hydrologic regime for enhanced, created, or restored mitigation areas;

(D) Location of mitigation site or sites in the watershed and relationship to existing water bodies and to associated wetlands and related wetlands that may be greater than three hundred feet from the project site;

(E) Any proposed changes in soil and substrate conditions and topographic elevations;

(F) Existing and proposed adjacent site conditions;

(G) Required wetland buffers (including any buffer reduction and mitigation proposed to increase the plant densities, remove weedy vegetation, and replant the buffers); and

(H) Ownership of mitigation site or sites.

d. An applicant should be aware that Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act and other federal and state statutes may apply.

e. The information provided by the study will augment the database for the Chelan area maintained by the city.

4. Development Standards.

a. General. No land surface modifications or alteration may take place and no improvement may be located in a regulated wetland except as specifically provided in this section and as provided by the exemptions described in Section 14.10.040(B).

b. Mitigation.

i. If alteration of a regulated wetland is unavoidable, mitigation shall be adequate to ensure no net loss of wetland area and functions including lost time when the wetland does not perform the function.

ii. Wetland mitigation ratios shall be consistent with the table below.

	Category and Type of Wetland	Creation or Reestablishment	Rehabilitation	Enhancement

	Category I: Bog, natural heritage site	Not considered possible	Case by case	Case by case

	Category I: Mature forested	6:1	12:1	24:1

	Category I: Based on functions	4:1	8:1	16:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	12:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	8:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	6:1

iii. Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans – Version 1, (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, Olympia, WA, March 2006 or as revised), and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Eastern Washington) (Publication No. 10-06-07, November 2010).

iv. To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios above, the administrator may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in “Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Eastern Washington: Final Report” (Ecology Publication No. 11-06-015, August 2012, or as revised).

v. Impacts to wetland buffers shall be mitigated at a 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development.

vi. The requirements of this section are in addition to the provisions of Section 14.10.040(J).

c. Essential Public Facility or Utility. The administrator may permit the placement of an essential public facility or utility in a regulated wetland. The administrator must determine that the public improvement must traverse a regulated wetland because no feasible alternative location exists. Compliance with all provisions of this chapter, including mitigation requirements, shall be required.

d. Buffer Widths. Buffers shall be established adjacent to and outside of all regulated wetlands. The following standard buffer widths shall be applied based on wetland category and habitat scoring unless a critical area study establishes, based on intensity of impacts, wetlands functions, or special characteristics as described in Appendix 8-D of Wetlands in Washington State, Volume 2: Managing and Protecting Wetlands (Department of Ecology Publication No. 05-06-008) as modified for the wetlands rating system in Department of Ecology Publication 14-06-030, 2014 Washington State Rating System for Eastern Washington Appendix 8-D, or as thereafter amended), that a greater or lesser buffer width would serve to protect the functions and values of a particular wetland:

	Wetland Category	Standard Buffer Width	Additional Buffer Width if Wetland Scores 3-4 Habitat Points	Additional Buffer Width if Wetland Scores 5-7 Habitat Points	Additional Buffer Width if Wetland Scores 8-9 Habitat Points

	Category I: Based on total score	75 ft	Add 15 ft	Add 45 ft	Add 75 ft

	Category I: Forested	75 ft	Add 15 ft	Add 45 ft	Add 75 ft

	Category I: Natural heritage wetlands	190 ft	NA	NA	NA

	Category II: Based on total score	75 ft	Add 15 ft	Add 45 ft	Add 75 ft

	Category II: Forested	75 ft	Add 15 ft	Add 45 ft	Add 75 ft

	Category III (all)	60 ft	Add 30 ft	Add 60 ft	NA

	Category IV (all)	40 ft	NA	NA	NA

The standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

e. Buffer Width Reduction with Enhancement. Buffers may be reduced by a maximum of twenty-five percent provided:

i. The critical area study demonstrates that the reduction will not:

(A) Adversely affect water quality;

(B) Destroy, damage, or disrupt a significant fish or wildlife habitat area, including scenic vistas;

(C) Adversely affect drainage and/or stormwater retention capabilities;

(D) Lead to unstable earth conditions or create erosion hazards; and

(E) Be materially detrimental to any other property in the area of the subject property or the city as a whole.

ii. The remaining buffer is enhanced with vegetation to a condition that is comparable to a comparable undisturbed plant community in the ecoregion. Enhanced buffers shall be monitored and maintained to the same standard as on-the-ground mitigation.

f. Buffer Width Reduction at Road Crossing. The required buffer may be administratively modified where a legally established road crosses a wetland buffer. The administrator may approve a modification of the minimum required buffer width to the waterward edge of the improved road if a study submitted by the applicant and prepared by a qualified professional demonstrates that the part of the buffer on the upland side of the road sought to be reduced:

i. Does not provide additional protection of the wetland; and

ii. Provides insignificant biological, geological or hydrological functions relating to the waterward portion of the buffer adjacent to the wetland.

g. Wetlands and wetland buffers shall be retained in their natural condition, with the following exceptions:

i. The following activities may occur in wetlands or wetland buffers:

(A) Education, scientific research, and low impact recreation facilities, including unpaved walkways or trails and associated facilities (e.g., benches, trash receptacles, interpretive signs) located in the outer twenty-five percent of the buffer area; wildlife viewing structures; and fishing access areas without vehicle access; provided they are designed and approved as part of an overall site development plan;

(B) Selective pruning of trees for safety or view protection is allowed in wetland buffers. Where trees pose a significant safety hazard, they may be removed from wetland buffers. All other tree removal in wetland buffers shall be minimized through site design, and mitigated when the loss of a tree or trees results in loss of ecological function;

(C) Existing and ongoing agricultural activities (provided no expansion into undisturbed wetland areas occurs);

(D) Maintenance of existing facilities, structures, ditches, roads and utility systems;

(E) Site investigative work necessary for land use application submittals such as surveys, soil logs, percolation tests and other related activities. In every case, critical area impacts shall be minimized and disturbed areas shall be immediately restored; and

(F) Artificial wetland construction approved as part of an overall site development plan or restoration or enhancement plan.

ii. Where wetland or wetland buffer disturbance is unavoidable during adjacent construction, restoration and revegetation with native plant materials in accordance with an approved mitigation plan will be required.

B. Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas.

1. Designation. To date there has been no site-specific delineation of critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs) for the city or its UGA, although general maps have been prepared by the Source Water Assessment Program of the Washington State Department of Health, Division of Environmental Health, Office of Drinking Water (SWAP).

a. Until CARAs have been delineated (based on site-specific modeling), the city of Chelan designates the following lands within the city and its urban growth area as potential CARAs:

i. Areas of hydrologic susceptibility, including water bodies, surface water intake protection areas, and wellhead protection areas shown on the map prepared for Chelan County by the SWAP; wetland areas shown on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map or on the city’s generalized sensitive areas map; areas in which soils show permeability ratings of more than twenty inches per hour as shown in the Chelan County Soil Survey; and any other lands that have been specifically identified as critical aquifer recharge areas based on reliable scientific data; and

ii. Areas in which contamination potential is high, including landfills; agricultural activities that do not incorporate best management practices; industrial facilities with heavy chemical use; underground storage tanks; aboveground storage tanks; commercial facilities that use solvents; hazardous waste or contaminated sites identified by Department of Ecology; or electroplating facilities.

b. Once CARAs have been delineated, the areas identified by the delineation shall be designated as CARAs.

2. Classification. Critical aquifer recharge areas shall be classified as follows:

a. Critical potential: Water bodies, surface water intake protection areas, and wellhead protection areas.

b. High potential: Wetlands, areas in which soils show permeability ratings of more than twenty inches per hour, areas in which contamination potential is high, and any other lands that have been specifically identified as critical recharge areas based on reliable scientific data.

3. Critical Area Review.

a. Preliminary Evaluation. In determining whether or not sufficient information is available to evaluate a proposal, the administrator shall, at a minimum, consider the map of water bodies, surface water intake protection areas, and wellhead protection areas prepared for Chelan County by the SWAP; the city’s wetlands and generalized sensitive areas maps; and the Chelan County Soil Survey, as well as considering the critical areas checklist and conducting a preliminary evaluation. A critical area study shall be required whenever the administrator determines that the information available is not sufficient to evaluate the proposal.

b. Identification. All development in or within two hundred and fifty feet of any known or potential CARA, including all areas of hydrogeologic susceptibility and high contamination potential listed above, shall be subject to these critical areas regulations, including the critical areas review process and the requirement to complete a critical areas review checklist.

c. Critical Area Study. An applicant may request that the city declassify or reclassify a specific area designated as a CARA. The application must be supported by a critical area study that includes a hydrogeologic evaluation. The application to declassify or reclassify an area shall be reviewed by the administrator and a determination made regarding amendment of the map. The hydrogeologic evaluation shall include, at a minimum:

i. Soil texture, permeability and attenuation properties including geologic setting, occurrence and movement of ground water;

ii. Characteristics of the vadose zone (the unsaturated top layer of soil and geologic material) including permeability and attenuation properties;

iii. Depth to ground water and/or impermeable soil layer;

iv. Aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and gradients, attenuation of contaminants;

v. Quantities of ground water and other relevant factors; and

vi. Potential for contamination of ground water due to the proposed action.

4. Development Standards. The following standards apply in all CARAs:

a. If the critical area study or hydrogeologic evaluation identifies significant potential impacts to CARAs, the project applicant will be required to fully document those impacts and provide a discussion of alternatives by which the impacts could be avoided or prevented.

b. The applicant shall provide a detailed mitigation plan for any unavoidable potential impacts. The city may require that the mitigation plan include process control and remediation as appropriate. Best management practices shall be employed to avoid introducing pollutants into the aquifer.

c. All developments in CARAs shall be evaluated for potential to contaminate ground water resources and lake water quality. If the administrator determines that a high potential for contamination exists, he or she may require that further surface water quality controls be installed for a development prior to discharge from a site. Those controls may include wetponds, water quality swales, filtration or sedimentation ponds or other water quality measures designed to protect aquifer and lake water quality.

d. The following uses are prohibited in all CARAs:

i. Mining of any type below the water table;

ii. Processing, storage, and disposal of radioactive substances;

iii. Hydrocarbon extraction;

iv. Commercial wood treatment facilities on permeable surfaces;

v. Wrecking yards;

vi. Landfills for hazardous waste, municipal solid waste, or special waste; and

vii. On-site septic systems on lots smaller than one acre without a treatment system that results in effluent nitrate-nitrogen concentrations below ten milligrams per liter.

e. In addition, the following uses are prohibited in areas of critical potential:

i. Hazardous liquid transmission pipelines;

ii. Sand, gravel, and hard rock mining on land that is not zoned for mining as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter;

iii. Golf courses; and

iv. Cemeteries.

f. Every alteration involving hazardous substance processing or handling that is located in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA shall provide containment devices adequate in size to contain on site any unauthorized release of hazardous substances from any area where those substances are stored, handled, treated, used, or produced. Containment devices shall prevent such substances from penetrating into the ground. This provision also applies to releases that may mix with storm runoff.

g. Every alteration involving hazardous substance processing or handling which is located in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA shall prepare a plan containing procedures to be followed to prevent, control, collect, and dispose of any unauthorized release of a hazardous substance.

h. Storage Tanks.

i. All storage tanks proposed for location in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA must comply with local building code requirements and must conform to the 2003 International Fire Code requirements for secondary containment.

ii. Underground Tanks. All new underground tanks located in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA shall be designed and constructed so as to:

(A) Prevent releases due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational life of the tank;

(B) Be protected against corrosion, constructed of noncorrosive material, steel clad with a noncorrosive material, or designed to include a secondary containment system to prevent the release or threatened release of any stored substance; and

(C) Use material in the construction or lining of the tank that is compatible with the substance to be stored.

iii. Aboveground Tanks. New aboveground storage tanks located in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA must be installed, used and maintained so as to prevent the release of any hazardous substance to the ground, ground waters, or surface water.

i. Agriculture. New agricultural activities in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA shall use best management practices to prevent ground quality degradation from livestock waste. Existing agricultural activities in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA shall be encouraged to use best management practices to prevent ground quality degradation from livestock waste.

j. Sewage Disposal. All residential, commercial or industrial alterations located in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA and within one hundred and fifty feet of a public sewer system shall be connected to the sewer system.

k. Golf Courses. Golf course operations proposed in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA shall be subject to a golf course maintenance plan using best management practices to protect ground water quality. The plan shall detail the proposed use of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, or other maintenance agents, with projected application methods and schedules and measures to prevent pollution of ground water.

l. Commercial Vehicle Repair and Servicing. New commercial vehicle repair and servicing in or within two hundred and fifty feet of a CARA must be conducted over impermeable pads and within a covered structure capable of withstanding normally expected weather conditions. Chemicals used in the process of vehicle repair and servicing must be stored in a manner that protects them from weather and provides containment should leaks occur. No dry wells shall be allowed in CARAs on sites used for vehicle repair and servicing. Dry wells existing on the site prior to facility development must be abandoned using techniques approved by the Washington State Department of Ecology prior to commencement of the proposed activity. Existing commercial vehicle repair and servicing facilities shall be encouraged to comply with the provisions of this subsection.

m. The uses listed in the table below shall be conditioned in accordance with the applicable state and federal regulations as necessary to protect critical aquifer recharge areas:

C. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas.

1. Designation. The city of Chelan designates the following lands within the city and its urban growth area as fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas:

a. All priority habitat and species areas shown on the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (WDFW) priority habitat and species maps, as amended;

b. All areas shown as wildlife habitat on the city’s generalized critical areas map; and

c. All riparian and wildlife corridors shown on the city’s open space map.

2. Classification. The city shall use the following two general classifications of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas:

a. Priority Habitat and Species Areas. All priority habitat and species areas shown on the WDFW priority habitat and species maps (as amended) shall be classified as priority habitat and species areas.

b. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas of Local Importance. Designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas not shown on the WDFW priority habitat and species maps (i.e., any areas shown as wildlife habitat on the city’s generalized critical areas map and any riparian and wildlife corridors shown on the city’s open space map that are not priority habitat and species areas) shall be classified as fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas of local importance.

3. Critical Area Review.

a. Identification and Preliminary Evaluation.

i. At a minimum, the city’s generalized critical areas map, the city’s open space map, the PHS maps, and any critical areas study that identifies fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas in the vicinity of a development site shall be used to determine whether critical area review will be required for a proposed alteration, in completing a critical areas checklist, and in the city’s review for the purpose of determining whether a critical areas study will be required.

ii. Because species populations and habitat systems are dynamic, agency consultation shall be required where activities are proposed within two hundred and fifty feet of a designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation area. The administrator shall consult with the WDFW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to determine the value of the site to federal or state identified endangered, threatened, sensitive, or candidate species; animal aggregations considered vulnerable by the WDFW; and those species of recreational, commercial, or tribal importance that are considered vulnerable by the WDFW. The administrator shall also consult with the WDFW to determine whether the proposed action may affect priority habitat.

iii. In reviewing proposed alterations, the city shall consider the fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas classification in establishing buffer widths, mitigation requirements, and permit conditions. Any decision regarding establishment of buffers, buffer widths, access restrictions, vegetation conservation and restoration requirements, mitigation requirements, or permit conditions outside of shoreline areas subject to the Shoreline Management Act shall be a Type IB procedure subject to Title 19. Lake Chelan and the Chelan River are shorelines subject to the Shoreline Management Act, and buffers have been assigned in the city’s shoreline master program.

b. Critical Area Study. In addition to the general requirements for critical area studies, the required critical area study for any fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall include the following:

i. An evaluation of the presence or absence of regulated species. Consultation with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and review of the priority habitats and species map for the development site and the area within two hundred and fifty feet of the site shall be required in developing the evaluation.

ii. A description of the nature and extent of the association of regulated species with the habitat conservation area and any critical ecological processes (such as feeding, breeding, resting, nesting and dispersal) occurring within the study area.

iii. A description of regulated species habitat requirements, seasonal range dynamics and movement corridor requirements, and relative tolerance of human activities and the cumulative effects of the previous development or future development in the region.

iv. An analysis of habitat quality, based on relative species diversity and species richness, in the study area.

v. An evaluation of the proposed alteration for its influence on the above wildlife factors and on the measures that are recommended to mitigate the potential degradation of animal and plant populations, reproduction rates, and overall habitat quality over the long term.

vi. Mitigation and management recommendations, including the width of any buffer required to protect habitat and species and any requirements for restoration of the buffer. Any relevant WDFW priority habitat and species management recommendations shall be consulted in developing the mitigation and management recommendations and identifying habitat and species protection measures.

c. The information provided by a critical area study will augment the database for the Chelan area maintained by the city.

4. Development Standards. In addition to the general provisions of this chapter and the requirements of the underlying zone, the following minimum standards shall apply to development activities within and adjacent to the specified fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas.

a. The proposed alteration shall be evaluated for its influence on regulated fish and wildlife habitat and species and for its ability to mitigate the potential degradation of animal and plant populations, reproduction rates, and overall habitat quality over the long term.

b. The following standards shall apply in all fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas:

i. All projects shall comply with the applicable federal, state and local regulations regarding protection of species and habitats identified upon a site.

ii. Outside of shoreline areas subject to the Shoreline Management Act, the administrator shall require the establishment of a buffer when, based on a critical area study, such a buffer is needed to protect the functions and values of a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area. Such buffers shall remain undisturbed or, where native vegetation has already been disturbed, shall be restored. Buffer widths shall reflect the classification and sensitivity of the habitat and the intensity of activity proposed, and shall be consistent with best available science.

iii. Within shoreline areas subject to the Shoreline Management Act, buffer widths have been assigned in the city’s shoreline master program (SMP). Such areas shall be subject to all relevant provisions of the city’s SMP. Lake Chelan and the Chelan River are shorelines subject to the Shoreline Management Act.

iv. Selective pruning of trees for safety is allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffers. Where trees pose a significant safety hazard, they may be removed from such buffers. All other tree removal in such buffers shall be minimized through site design, and mitigated when the loss of a tree or trees results in loss of ecological function.

v. Selective pruning of trees for view protection may be allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffers, subject to mitigation and enhancement based on an approved critical area study.

vi. Any approved alteration or development in a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or its buffer shall be required to minimize impacts to native vegetation, including the composition and structure of the native plant community. Where disturbance is unavoidable, the applicant shall restore the area in accordance with the mitigation plan in the critical area study. New plantings shall be maintained in good growing condition and kept free of invasive weeds until well established.

vii. Subdivision of lands within fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be subject to the following:

(A) All division of land shall be accomplished by planned development when a threatened or endangered species is verified to be present.

(B) All division of land shall be accomplished by planned development when twenty-five percent or more of the site falls within one or more designated fish and wildlife conservation areas.

viii. Projects shall be encouraged to participate in habitat preservation projects, such as the WDFW’s Backyard Wildlife Sanctuary Program.

c. The following additional standards shall apply in priority habitat and species areas and their buffers:

i. Any uses and activities allowed within priority habitat and species areas shall be limited to those that will not adversely affect or degrade the habitat and threaten critical ecological processes identified in the critical area study. Buildings, roads, agriculture and other uses requiring large land areas shall not be permitted within priority habitat and species areas. Where feasible, corridors of critical habitat that maintain connections between high-quality habitat units shall be preserved.

ii. No development approval shall be granted unless mitigation of adverse effects will be provided that will ensure continuation of baseline populations for all priority habitats and priority species.

iii. Retention of native vegetation shall be encouraged. Native vegetation shall not be removed except in accordance with an approved critical area study. In such cases clearing shall be limited to those areas necessary and disturbed areas shall be replanted with site-appropriate native vegetation.

iv. Access to priority habitat and species areas or their buffers may be restricted in accordance with the findings of a critical area study, mitigation plan, PHS management recommendations or other best available science. Access restrictions may include fencing and signs, as needed to ensure protection of habitat functions and values. Restrictions may be seasonal.

d. Provided that adequate regional populations are maintained, development may be allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas of local importance when only species and habitats of local importance will suffer population declines or interruption of migration routes or reproduction habits; provided, that endemic species are preserved.

D. Geologically Hazardous Areas. The GMA addresses five kinds of geologically hazardous areas: erosion hazard areas, landslide hazard areas, mine hazard areas, seismic hazard areas, and volcanic hazard areas. There are no known mine hazard areas or volcanic hazard areas in the city of Chelan or its UGA.

1. Designation and Classification. The city of Chelan designates the following lands within the city and its urban growth area as geologically hazardous areas, and classifies them as shown below:

a. Erosion hazard areas, as follows:

i. Steep slope areas, as defined in this chapter.

ii. Areas containing soils that have been identified in the Soil Survey of Chelan County, Washington, as “highly erodible land” and “potentially highly erodible land.”

iii. Ravines, as defined in this chapter.

b. Landslide hazard areas, as defined in this chapter. For the purpose of determining whether a critical areas study will be required, the following areas shall be considered potential landslide hazard areas, subject to the critical areas review process in Section 14.10.040(F):

i. Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mud flows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and those areas downslope of these areas that could be affected by landslide runout or debris torrents.

ii. Any area with a combination of all of the following:

(A) Slopes greater than fifteen percent; and

(B) Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and

(C) Springs or ground water seepage.

iii. Any area potentially unstable as a result of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, channel migration, or undercutting by wave action.

iv. Slopes that are parallel or sub-parallel to planes of weakness in subsurface materials such as bedding planes, joint systems and fault planes.

v. Areas with slope gradients of forty percent or greater not composed of consolidated rock. These will be of at least ten feet of vertical relief.

c. Seismic Hazard Areas. Those areas in seismic design category D0 on the Seismic Design Category Map for Residential Construction in Washington, Sheet 2.

2. Critical Area Review.

a. Preliminary Evaluation.

i. Erosion Hazard Areas. In determining whether a critical area study is required for development in a known or potential erosion hazard area, the administrator shall, at a minimum, consider the generalized sensitive areas map and any geotechnical assessment, geotechnical report, hydrogeologic evaluation, channel migration zone study, or other special or detailed study that may identify such areas.

ii. Landslide Hazard Areas. In determining whether a critical area study is required for development in a known or potential landslide hazard area, the administrator shall consider the generalized sensitive areas; relevant maps published by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources showing areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mud flows, lahars, or landslides; and any geotechnical assessment, geotechnical report, hydrogeologic evaluation, channel migration zone study, or other special or detailed study that may identify such areas.

iii. Seismic Hazard Areas. Until a site-specific map of seismic hazard areas has been adopted, the Seismic Design Category Map for Residential Construction in Washington, Sheet 2, shall be used to make a preliminary identification of such areas for the purposes of determining the need for a critical area study.

b. Critical Area Study. A required critical area study for geologically hazardous areas shall include a geotechnical report, prepared by a qualified professional, adequate to assess any risks of property damage, death, or injury resulting from development of the hazard area and establish mitigation measures. Said geotechnical report shall, at a minimum:

i. Provide a map at a scale of one inch equals two hundred feet showing:

(A) Contour lines at five-foot intervals; and

(B) The location of slopes between fifteen and twenty-nine percent, and slopes of thirty percent or greater; and

(C) Figures for area coverage of each slope category on the site.

ii. Describe site history, including any prior grading, site structures, soil instability, or slope failure.

iii. Determine the soil characteristics and geologic, topographic, soil moisture, ground water, and hydrologic conditions of the site that might be expected to create a significant hazard due to any geologic hazard and show the location of such hazardous areas. Specifically, include:

(A) Slope stability studies and opinion of slope stability;

(B) Erosion vulnerability of site;

(C) Suitability of on-site soil for fill;

(D) A summary of all subsurface exploration data, including subsurface soil profile, exploration logs, laboratory or in situ test results, and ground water information and an interpretation and analysis of the subsurface data; and

(E) Building limitations.

iv. Evaluate the proposed alteration’s influence on the safety and stability of structures and any other risks of property damage, death, or injury resulting from development of the hazard area. Factors such as landscape irrigation, ponds or artificial stream channels, stormwater generation and the effect of street conveyance and utility placement should be included in the review of potential landslide hazard areas.

v. Specify appropriate mitigation measures, including design, development, and construction measures that will be taken to eliminate or minimize identified risks. Specify any recommended setbacks and/or buffers. Include specific engineering recommendations for design and any geotechnical special provisions. Specifically, include:

(A) Proposed angles of cut and fill slopes and site grading requirements;

(B) Structural foundation requirements and estimated foundation settlements;

(C) Soil compaction criteria;

(D) Proposed surface and subsurface drainage; and

(E) Lateral earth pressures.

vi. Include a soil erosion control plan that minimizes erosion from all disturbed areas with preventive measures described in the City of Chelan Surface Water Design Manual (Chapter 5). Said measures may include silt fences, sedimentation ponds or other measures approved by the administrator. Revegetation shall include permanent revegetation measures. Permanent vegetation shall be established within one growing season.

c. If an applicant can demonstrate, through submittal of a geotechnical assessment or best available science, that no landslide or erosion hazards exist on site, and that the proposed development would not increase the potential for landslide or erosion hazards downslope of the site, the requirement for a geotechnical report may be waived by the administrator.

d. Where a geotechnical report has been prepared and approved by the city within the last five years for a specific site, and where the proposed activity and surrounding site conditions are unchanged, said report may be utilized and a new report may not be required. The applicant shall submit a geotechnical assessment detailing any changed environmental conditions associated with the site.

e. In the case of development of an individual lot within a subdivision for which a valid geotechnical report has been prepared and approved by the city within the last five years, and where the only changes in surrounding site conditions are development and mitigation as specified in the report, said report may be utilized and a new report may not be required. The applicant shall submit a geotechnical assessment detailing any changed environmental conditions associated with the site and development affecting the site (e.g., roads, retaining walls, drainage structures, adjacent lots) and shall describe the performance of any mitigation actions at the subdivision.

f. Geologically hazardous areas may be present at the site that cannot readily be identified based upon the criteria of subsection (D)(1) of this section. Geologically hazardous areas of unknown risk include areas where data is not available to determine the presence or absence of a geological hazard. The administrator may require a geologic site assessment and/or geotechnical report to determine the actual presence or absence of a geologically hazardous area.

3. Development Standards.

a. Any development or other alteration that would pose a foreseeable risk to the public, public or private resources and facilities, or the natural environment is prohibited.

b. Erosion Hazard Areas.

i. In order to prevent or mitigate potential hazards to life, property or the natural environment, development in or adjacent to erosion hazard areas shall be discouraged.

ii. Public or private development will be permitted in erosion hazard areas where mitigation approved by the city and adequate to protect members of the public and public and private resources and facilities from injury, loss of life, property damage or financial losses due to erosion, landslide, seismic events or steep slope failure is feasible.

iii. Excavation and grading shall be minimized in all erosion and steep slope areas and shall comply in full with the adopted building code in Chapter 15.04.

iv. Ravines and Ravine Sidewalls.

(A) Development in ravines and ravine channels shall be limited to erosion or sedimentation control features and roadway crossings that provide for adequate drainage and that have been approved by the public works director of the city.

(B) Proposed alterations that are adjacent to ravine sidewalls shall maintain a building setback from the top of the ravine of no less than fifty feet. All drainage within the setback shall be directed one hundred feet away from the ravine sidewall, or if not feasible, to the ravine stream using closed pipe and energy dissipation structure. This section shall not apply to existing piped streams, nor to lands already developed as of the effective date of these regulations. Lands already developed shall manage the ravine setback based on recommendations of a qualified professional to the satisfaction of the administrator.

(C) A fifty-foot undisturbed buffer of native vegetation shall be established from the top, toe, and sides of all ravine sidewalls and bluffs.

(D) The administrator may approve a reduction in the width of the required buffer, to a minimum width of twenty-five feet, when an approved critical area study demonstrates all of the following:

(1) The development proposal will result in minimal risk of soil instability; and

(2) Special mitigation measures regarding design, construction, and maintenance can reasonably be employed to minimize adverse impacts to soil, slopes, and natural vegetation associated with the proposal; and

(3) The proposal represents minimal disruption of existing native vegetation.

(E) The administrator may require increased buffers if an approved critical area study indicates such increases are necessary to mitigate geologic hazards, or as otherwise necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

v. Development may occur in steep slope areas only after the following standards have been met:

(A) Development must be located to minimize disturbance and removal of vegetation and also to protect the most sensitive areas (including areas of erosive soils, areas at risk of erosion by wind or water, and areas of dense vegetation) and retain open space. The use of continuous greenbelt areas shall be encouraged; and

(B) Structures must be clustered where possible to reduce disturbance and maintain natural topographic character. Common access driveways shall be considered as a means of reducing construction disturbances; and

(C) Where possible, structures must conform to the natural contour of the slope and foundations must be tiered to conform to existing topography of the site.

vi. Unless a grading plan prepared by a licensed civil engineer is provided and approved by the administrator, disturbance of a development site shall generally not exceed the following for the slope categories indicated:

Table 2: Maximum Amount of Slope That May Be Disturbed 

	Slope Category	Factor

	Slopes 30 – 40% (60% of the site or more)	0.60

	Slopes 40% + (also see landslide hazard area)	0.30

The overall amount of disturbance allowed on development sites which have any combination of the above slope categories shall be determined by the following formula:

[Square footage of the area within the slope category x slope factor] = Total amount of allowable disturbance for that slope classification.

The total amount of allowable disturbance for the site is the sum of all the allowable disturbance totals for each slope category.

c. Landslide Hazard Areas. Hillsides containing or within two hundred and fifty feet of landslide hazard areas shall be altered only when the administrator concludes, based on environmental information provided by a qualified professional, that:

i. There will be no increase in surface water discharge, subsurface water, or sedimentation to adjacent properties; and

ii. There will be no decrease in slope stability on adjacent properties; and

iii. Either:

(A) There is no hazard as indicated by professional review of potential landslide activity in the recent past in the vicinity of the proposed development and a quantitative analysis of slope stability indicates no significant risk to the proposed development or to the health or safety of humans or the environment of the subject property or adjacent properties; or

(B) The landslide hazard area can be modified or the proposed development can be designed so that the landslide hazard is eliminated or mitigated so that the site is as safe as a site without a landslide hazard; or

(C) The proposal is so minor as not to pose a threat.

d. Seismic Hazard Areas. All development activities in seismic hazard areas shall conform to the applicable building code.

E. Frequently Flooded Areas.

1. Designation. The city of Chelan designates the following lands within the city and its urban growth area (UGA) as frequently flooded areas:

a. All areas of special flood hazard indicated in the Flood Insurance Study for the City of Chelan, Washington, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps, as revised or amended; and

b. Any areas of special flood hazard indicated in the Flood Insurance Study for Chelan County, Washington, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps, as revised or amended, that are within the city or its UGA; and

c. All additional areas of special flood hazard identified by any special or detailed study.

2. Identification. Critical area review shall be required prior to development in any area that appears to be a frequently flooded area to determine whether the proposed development is within an area of special flood hazard. The critical area review shall be conducted using applicable existing flood insurance studies, flood hazard boundary maps, flood insurance rate maps, special or detailed studies, and information prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

3. Development Standards. All development must comply in full with the city’s flood hazard areas provisions, Chapter 15.10, as those provisions may be amended. (Ord. 1533 § 6 (Exh. 6) (part), 2017: Ord. 1397 § 7 (Exh. 6) (part), 2009: Ord. 952 §§ 3 – 6, 1992; Ord. 944 § 1 (part), 1992).


14.10.070 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

 The degree of hazard protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Catastrophic natural disasters can, and will, occur on rare occasions. This chapter does not imply that land outside the critical areas or activities permitted within such areas will be free from exposure or damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, and officers or employees thereof, for any damages that result from the reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

15.10.010 Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose, and objectives.

A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Washington has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Chelan, Washington, does ordain as follows:

B. Findings of Fact.

1. The flood hazard areas of the city of Chelan are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

C. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

1. To protect human life and health;

2. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

7. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;

8. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

D. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 1307 § 2 (part), 2005).


15.10.020 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, terms or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” (as designated as AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)): AO zones have base flood depths that range from one to three feet above the natural ground; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow; AH indicates ponding, and is shown with standard base flood elevations.

“Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the flood plain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also referred to as the “hundred-year flood”). Designated on Flood Insurance Rate Maps by the letters A or V.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 

“Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on the FIRM as Zone V1-30, VE or V.

“Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include (but are not limited to) schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

“Director” means the director of community planning, or such other officer or employee of the city appointed by the mayor to satisfy the administrative requirements of this chapter.

“Elevated building” means for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building that has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, post, piers, pilings, or columns.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the adopted floodplain management regulations.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

“Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at Section 15.10.050(B)(1) (i.e., provided there are adequate flood ventilation openings). 

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of adopted floodplain management regulations.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle:

1. Built on a single chassis;

2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

1. Before the improvement or repair is started; or

2. If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

The term can exclude:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct pre-cited existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been previously identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Water dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry that cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations. (Ord. 1307 § 2 (part), 2005).


15.10.030 General provisions.

A. Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the city. 

B. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Chelan, Washington,” dated January 5, 1978, and any revisions thereto, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and the FIRM are on file at the office of community planning. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in Section 15.10.040(C)(2) shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under Section 15.10.040(C)(2).

C. Noncompliance Shall Be a Nuisance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a nuisance, and the city may take all steps established by this code relating to the regulation of nuisances. 

D. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another chapter, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

E. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

1. Considered as minimum requirements;

2. Liberally construed in favor of the city; and

3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 1307 § 2 (part), 2005).


15.10.040 Administration.

A. Establishment of Development Permit.

1. Development Permit Required. A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 15.10.030(B). The permit shall be for all structures, including manufactured homes, and for all development including fill and other activities. 

2. Application for Development Permit. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the director and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

a. Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;

b. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed; 

c. Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet floodproofing criteria in Section 15.10.050(B)(2); 

d. Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

B. Designation of Administrator. The director shall administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions.

C. Duties and Responsibilities of the Director. The duties of the director shall include, but not be limited to:

1. Permit Review.

a. Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.

b. Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.

c. Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of Section 15.10.050(D) are met. 

2. Use of Other Base Flood Data (In A and V Zones). When base flood elevation data has not been provided (in A or V Zones) in accordance with Section 15.10.030(B), the director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Sections 15.10.050(B) and (D). 

3. Information to be Obtained and Maintained.

a. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or required as in subsection (C)(2) of this section, obtain and record the actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.

b. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required in subsection (C)(2) of this section:

i. Obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed;

ii. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in subsection (A)(2) of this section.

c. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

4. Alteration of Watercourses.

a. Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.

b. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.

5. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (e.g., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation. Such appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of the Rules and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 59-76). 

D. Conditions for Variances.

1. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 

2. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

3. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

4. Variances shall only be issued upon:

a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

5. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from flood elevations should be quite rare.

6. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (D)(1) of this section, and otherwise complies with Sections 15.10.050(A)(1), (2) and (4).

7. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk. (Ord. 1307 § 2 (part), 2005).


15.10.050 Provisions for flood hazard reduction.

A. General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:

1. Anchoring.

a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 

b. All manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.

2. Construction Materials and Methods.

a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

b. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

c. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Locating such equipment below the base flood elevation may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be increased.

c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; 

d. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less).

5. Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source, applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. 

B. Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 15.10.030(B), or Section 15.10.040(C)(2), the following provisions are required:

1. Residential Construction.

a. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation (BFE). 

b. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 

i. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 

ii. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

iii. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

2. Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

a. Be floodproofed so that below one foot or more above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 15.10.040(C)(3); 

d. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (B)(1)(b) of this section.

3. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes in the floodplain to be placed or substantially improved on sites shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.

4. Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:

a. Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days;

b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

c. Meet the requirements of subsection (B)(3) of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.

C. AE and A1-30 Zones with Base Flood Elevations but No Floodways. In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 

D. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.10.030(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that can carry debris, and increase erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

2. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for (a) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and (b) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure either (i) before the repair, or reconstruction is started, or (ii) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or to structures identified as historic places, may be excluded in the fifty percent.

3. If Section 15.10.040(A) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

E. Critical Facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) (one-hundred-year-floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet above BFE or to the height of the five-hundred-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 1307 § 2 (part), 2005).

15.22.150 Nondiscrimination.

A grantee shall make its telecommunications services available to any customer within its franchise area who shall request such service, without discrimination as to the terms, conditions, rates or charges for the grantee’s services; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a grantee from making any reasonable classifications among differently situated customers.

No franchise shall be renewed until any ongoing violations or defaults in the grantee’s obligations under the franchise, or the requirements of this chapter and all applicable laws, statutes, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations, have been cured, or a plan detailing the corrective action to be taken by the grantee has been approved by the city. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).

The city shall consult with the grantee on the construction schedule. The grantee shall complete the relocation by the date specified by the city, unless a later date is set for completion pursuant to RCW 35.99.060(2), or by mutual agreement of the city and the grantee.

C. Except as otherwise provided by law, the costs and expenses associated with relocations or disconnections ordered pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be borne by grantee; provided, however, the grantee shall not be limited in its ability to seek reimbursement for relocation costs when permitted by RCW 35.99.060.

D. The city may require the relocation of grantee’s small wireless telecommunications facilities at grantee’s expense in the event of an unforeseen emergency that creates an immediate threat to the public safety, health or welfare. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.270 Failure to relocate.

If a grantee is required to relocate, change, or alter the small wireless telecommunications facilities constructed, operated and/or maintained hereunder and fails to do so, the city may cause such to occur. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.280 Emergency removal or relocation of facilities.

The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move any small wireless telecommunications facilities located within the rights-of-way as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.290 Damage to grantee’s facilities.

Unless directly and proximately caused by the sole negligence or malicious acts of the city, the city shall not be liable for any damage to or loss of any small wireless telecommunications facility within rights-of-way as a result of or in connection with any public works, public improvements, construction, excavation, grading, filling, or work of any kind in the rights-of- way by or on behalf of the city. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.300 Removal of unauthorized facilities.

Within thirty days following written notice from the director, any grantee, service provider, or other person that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized telecommunications system, facility, or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove such facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. If such grantee fails to remove such facilities or appurtenances, the city may cause the removal and charge the grantee for the costs incurred. A telecommunications or other facility or system is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:

A. Upon expiration or termination of the grantee’s franchise;

B. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way;

C. If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a franchise;

D. If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior issuance of a required utility right-of-way permit;

E. If the system or facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the grantee’s franchise;

B. If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete restoration required hereunder, the grantee shall temporarily restore the affected rights-of-way or other property. Such temporary restoration shall be at the grantee’s sole expense and the grantee shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such permanent restoration.

C. A grantee or other person acting on its behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares and other measures as required for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent injury or damage to any person, vehicle or property by reason of such work in or affecting rights-of-way or any other property.

D. All restoration shall comply with the city’s construction and design standards. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.320 Facilities maps.

Each grantee shall provide the city with an accurate as-built map or maps certifying the location of all telecommunications facilities within the city and particularly within rights-of-way. Each grantee shall provide updated as-built maps annually. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.330 Duty to provide information.

Within thirty days of a written request from the director, or other department as the city administrator may designate, each grantee shall furnish the director with information sufficient to demonstrate that:

A. The grantee has complied with all requirements of this chapter;

B. All fees due the city in connection with the telecommunications services and facilities provided by the grantee have been properly collected and paid by the grantee;

C. All books, records, maps and other documents maintained by the grantee with respect to its facilities within rights-of-way shall be made available for inspection by the director. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.340 Grantee insurance.

A. As consideration for the issuance of a franchise, each grantee shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring both the grantee and the city as an additional insured against claims for injuries to persons, death, or damages to property which may arise from or in connection with the exercise of the rights, privileges, and authority granted to the grantee:

1. Comprehensive general liability insurance, written on an occurrence basis, with limits not less than:

a. Two million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;

b. Two million dollars for property damage resulting from any one accident;

c. Two million dollars for all other types of liability; and

d. Five million dollars in the aggregate for bodily injury and property damage.

2. Automobile liability for owned, non-owned, and hired vehicles with a combined single limit of two million dollars for each accident;

3. Workers’ compensation within statutory limits and employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than one million dollars; and

4. Comprehensive form premises-operations, explosions and collapse hazard, underground hazard and products completed hazard with limits of not less than five million dollars.

5. Excess umbrella liability policy with limits of no less than five million dollars per occurrence and in the aggregate.

B. The liability insurance policies required by this section shall be maintained by the grantee throughout the term of the franchise, and such other period of time during which the grantee is operating without a franchise or is engaged in the removal of its small wireless telecommunications facilities. Failure to maintain such insurance shall be grounds for cancellation. The grantee shall provide an insurance certificate, together with an endorsement including the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, employees, representatives, engineers, consultants, and volunteers as additional insureds, to the city prior to the commencement of any work or installation of any small wireless telecommunications facilities pursuant to said franchise. Payment of deductibles and self-insured retentions shall be the sole responsibility of the grantee. The insurance certificate required by this section shall contain a clause stating that coverage shall apply separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer’s liability. The grantee’s insurance shall be primary and noncontributory insurance as respects the city, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, agents, representatives, engineers, consultants, and volunteers. Any insurance maintained by the city, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, consultants, agents, representatives, engineers, and volunteers shall be in excess of the grantee’s insurance and shall not contribute with it. Receipt by the city of any certificate showing less coverage than required is not a waiver of grantee’s obligations to fulfill the requirements. Grantee may utilize primary and excess liability insurance policies to satisfy the insurance policy limits required in this section. Grantee’s excess liability insurance policy shall provide “follow form” coverage over its primary liability insurance policies.

C. In addition to the coverage requirements set forth in this section, the grantee must notify the city of any cancellation or reduction in said coverage. Within thirty days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event later than fifteen days prior to said cancellation or intent not to renew, the grantee shall obtain and furnish to the city a replacement insurance certificate meeting the requirements of this section.

D. Grantee’s maintenance of insurance as required by this section shall not be construed to limit the liability of grantee to the coverage provided by such insurance, or otherwise limit the city’s recourse to any remedy available at law or equity. Further, grantee’s maintenance of insurance policies required by this franchise shall not be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by grantee.

E. Upon approval by the director and based on conditions set by the city in the franchise, the grantee may self-insure under the same terms as required by this section. Further, the director may modify these insurance requirements as he/she deems necessary to comply with the city’s risk management policies or as otherwise approved by the city’s risk manager; provided, that any such changes provide adequate protection for the city. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.350 General indemnification.

As consideration for the issuance of a franchise, the franchise shall include an indemnity clause substantially conforming to the following:

A. Grantee hereby releases, covenants not to bring suit and agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the city, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, agents, engineers, consultants, volunteers, and representatives from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, or liability to any person arising from injury, sickness, or death of any person or damage to property:

1. For which the negligent acts or omissions of grantee, its agents, servants, officers or employees in performing the activities authorized are the proximate cause;

2. By virtue of grantee’s exercise of the rights granted herein;

3. By virtue of the city’s permitting grantee’s use of the rights-of-way or other city property;

4. Based upon the city’s inspection or lack of inspection of work performed by grantee, its agents and servants, officers or employees in connection with work authorized on a small wireless telecommunications facility, rights-of-way or other city property over which the city has control pursuant to any franchise issued;

5. Arising as a result of the negligent acts or omissions of grantee, its agents, servants, officers or employees in barricading, instituting trench safety systems or providing other adequate warnings of any excavation, construction, or work upon a small wireless telecommunications facility, in any rights-of-way in performance of work or services;

6. Based upon radio frequency emissions or radiation emitted from grantee’s equipment located upon a small wireless telecommunications facility, regardless of whether grantee’s equipment complies with applicable federal statutes and/or FCC regulations related thereto.

B. Grantee’s indemnification obligations pursuant to subsection A of this section shall include assuming potential liability for actions brought against the city by grantee’s own employees and the employees of grantee’s agents, representatives, contractors, and subcontractors even though grantee might be immune under RCW Title 51 from direct suit brought by such an employee. It is expressly agreed and understood that this assumption of potential liability for actions brought against the city by the aforementioned employees is with respect to claims against the city arising by virtue of grantee’s exercise of its rights. In addition to the indemnification obligations throughout this section, the obligations of grantee under this subsection shall be mutually negotiated between the parties. Grantee shall acknowledge that the city would not enter into an agreement without grantee’s waiver thereof. To the extent required to provide this indemnification and this indemnification only, grantee will waive its immunity under RCW Title 51 as provided in RCW 4.24.115.

C. Inspection or acceptance by the city of any work performed by grantee at the time of completion of construction shall not be grounds for avoidance of any of these covenants of indemnification. Provided that grantee has been given prompt written notice by the city of any such claim, said indemnification obligations shall also extend to claims which are not reduced to a suit and any claims which may be compromised prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation. The city has the right to defend or participate in the defense of any such claim and has the right to approve any settlement or other compromise of any such claim.

D. In the event that grantee refuses the tender of defense in any suit or any claim, said tender having been made pursuant to this section, and said refusal is subsequently determined by a court having jurisdiction (or such other tribunal that the parties agree to decide the matter), to have been a wrongful refusal on the part of grantee, then grantee shall pay all of the city’s costs for defense of the action, including all reasonable expert witness fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, the reasonable costs of the city, and reasonable attorneys’ fees of recovering under this subsection.

E. The obligations of grantee under the indemnification provisions of this section shall apply regardless of whether liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damages to property were caused or contributed to by the concurrent negligence of the city, its officers, agents, employees or contractors. The provisions of this section, however, are not to be construed to require the grantee to hold harmless, defend, or indemnify the city as to any claim, demand, suit, or action which arises out of the sole negligence of the city. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a franchise is subject to the provisions of RCW 4.24.115, the parties agree that the indemnity provisions hereunder shall be deemed amended to provide that the grantee’s obligation to indemnify the city hereunder shall extend only to the extent of grantee’s negligence.

F. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, grantee assumes the risk of damage to its small wireless telecommunications facilities located in the rights-of-way and upon city property from activities conducted by the city, its officers, agents, employees and contractors, except to the extent any such damage or destruction is caused by or arises from the sole negligence or malicious action on the part of the city, its officers, agents, employees or contractors. Grantee releases and waives any and all such claims against the city, its officers, agents, employees and contractors. In no event shall the city be responsible for indirect, special, consequential, or punitive damages or losses, including but not limited to lost income or business interruption, whether or not a party has been advised of the possibility of such damage and notwithstanding the theory of liability in which an action may be brought. Grantee further agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city against any claims for damages, including, but not limited to, business interruption damages and lost profits, brought by or under users of grantee’s small wireless telecommunications facilities as the result of any interruption of service due to damage or destruction of grantee’s small wireless telecommunications facilities caused by or arising out of activities conducted by the city, its officers, agents, employees or contractors.

G. These indemnification requirements shall survive the expiration, revocation, or termination of a franchise issued thereunder. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.360 Security fund.

A. Prior to issuance of a franchise pursuant to this chapter, each grantee shall establish a permanent security fund with the city by depositing the amount of fifty thousand dollars, or such other amount as deemed necessary by the director, with the city in cash, bond, or an unconditional letter of credit, based upon both operating history in rights-of-way and city property, and the cost of removal of the grantee’s facilities, which fund shall be maintained at the sole expense of the grantee so long as any of the grantee’s small wireless telecommunications facilities are located within the rights-of-way.

B. The fund shall serve as security for the full and complete performance of this chapter and the franchise including any costs, expenses, damages, or loss the city pays or incurs, including civil penalties, because of any failure attributable to the grantee to comply with the codes, ordinances, rules, regulations, or permits of the city applicable to the construction, maintenance, repair, or removal of small wireless telecommunications facilities in the rights-of-way or upon city property.

C. The city and the grantee shall agree upon and specify in the franchise certain amounts which represent both parties’ best estimate of the damages for failure to comply with the franchise issued hereunder. The liquidated damages provided in the franchise shall be the exclusive monetary remedy for the named breaches. Neither the right to liquidated damages nor the payment of liquidated damages shall bar or otherwise limit the right of the city in a proper case to:

1. Obtain judicial enforcement of a grantee’s obligations by means of specific performance, injunctive relief, mandamus, or other remedies at law or in equity;

2. Consider any substantial violation or breach as grounds for forfeiture and termination of a franchise issued hereunder; and

3. Consider any violation or breach as grounds for nonrenewal or nonextension of a franchise or issuance of a new franchise.

D. Before any sums are withdrawn from the security fund, the city shall give written notice to the grantee:

1. Describing the act, default or failure to be remedied, or the damages, costs, or expenses which the city has incurred by reason of grantee’s act or default regarding the installation, maintenance, repair, or removal of small wireless telecommunications facilities in the rights-of-way, or upon city property or in connection with restoration of the foregoing;

2. Providing a reasonable opportunity for grantee to first remedy the existing or ongoing default or failure regarding the installation, maintenance, repair, or removal of small wireless telecommunications facilities in the rights-of-way or in connection with the restoration of the foregoing, if applicable;

3. Providing a reasonable opportunity for grantee to pay any monies due the city before the city withdraws the amount thereof from the security fund, if applicable; and

4. That the grantee will be given an opportunity to review the act, default or failure described in the notice with the city or his or her designee.

E. Grantees shall replenish the security fund within fourteen days after written notice from the city that there is a deficiency in the amount of the fund.

F. Upon termination or expiration of a franchise all funds remaining in the security fund shall be returned to the grantee within thirty days after removal of grantee’s small wireless telecommunications facilities within the rights-of-way. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.370 Performance and maintenance bonds.

A. Grantee performing work in the rights-of-way must provide a performance bond written by a corporate surety acceptable to the city equal to at least one hundred fifty percent of the estimated cost of completing or removing the telecommunications facilities and restoring the rights-of-way or city property to its preconstruction condition. The director may, at his/her discretion, waive the bonding requirement for specific projects. This bond may be placed for the entirety of the grantee’s projects; provided, that grantee is able to quantify the full estimated cost of its deployment of telecommunications facilities. If a grantee provides a bond on a per project basis, such grantee is permitted to increase the bond for future projects, or if a project is complete, grantee may apply the bond to other projects in the rights-of-way. The purpose of this bond is to guarantee completion or removal of partially completed or nonconforming small wireless telecommunications facilities, and to fully restore the rights-of-way and city property to their preconstruction condition.

B. If required by the city, a grantee shall furnish a two-year warranty bond, or other surety acceptable to the city, upon the completion of grantee’s construction work, including any restoration work, within the rights-of-way. The warranty bond amount will be equal to fifteen percent of the documented final cost of the construction and restoration work.

C. The performance bond shall guarantee, to the satisfaction of the city:

1. Timely completion of construction;

2. Construction in compliance with applicable plans, permits, technical codes and standards;

3. Proper location of the facilities as specified by the city;

4. Restoration of the rights-of-way and any other property affected by the construction;

5. The submission of as-built drawings after completion of the work;

All grantees are required to cooperate with the city and with each other.

A. Each grantee shall meet with the city, other grantees and users of the rights-of-way annually or as determined by the city to schedule and coordinate construction in rights-of-way.

B. All construction locations, activities, and schedules shall be coordinated, as ordered by the director, to minimize public inconvenience, disruption, or damages. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.390 Assignments or transfers of grant of franchise.

A. A franchise may not be directly or indirectly assigned, transferred, or disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation, or other act of grantee, by operation of law or otherwise, unless prompt written notice is provided to the city within sixty days of the assignment. In the case of transfer or assignment as security by mortgage or other security instrument in whole or in part to secure indebtedness, such notice shall not be required unless and until the secured party elects to realize upon the collateral. For purposes of this section, no assignment or transfer of a franchise shall be deemed to occur based on the public trading of grantee’s stock; provided, however, that any tender offer, merger, or similar transaction resulting in a change of control shall be subject to the provisions of a franchise.

B. Any transactions which singularly or collectively result in a change of fifty percent or more of the ownership or working control (for example, management of grantee or its small wireless telecommunications facilities) of the grantee or of the ownership or working control of the grantee’s small wireless telecommunications facilities within the city, or of the ownership or working control having ownership or working control of the grantee or of the grantee’s small wireless telecommunications facilities within the city, or of control of the capacity or bandwidth of the grantee’s small wireless telecommunication facilities within the city, shall be considered an assignment or transfer requiring notice to the city pursuant to a franchise. Such transactions between affiliated entities are not exempt from notice requirements. A grantee shall notify the city of any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by, any other party of control of a grantee within sixty days following the closing of the transaction. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.400 Notice and duty to cure.

In the event that the director believes that grounds exist for revocation of a franchise, the grantee shall be given written notice of the apparent violation or noncompliance, be provided a short and concise statement of the nature and general facts of the violation or noncompliance, and be given a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty days to furnish evidence that:

A. Corrective action has been, or is being, actively and expeditiously pursued to remedy the violation or noncompliance.

B. Rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance.

C. It would be in the public interest to impose some monetary damages, penalty, or sanction less than revocation. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.410 Revocation hearing.

In the event that a grantee fails to provide evidence reasonably satisfactory, as provided hereunder, to the director, he/she shall refer the apparent violation or noncompliance to the city. The city shall provide the grantee with notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard concerning the matter. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.420 Standards for revocation.

If persuaded that the grantee has violated or failed to comply with a material provision of this chapter or of a franchise or applicable codes, ordinances, resolutions, or statutes, the city shall determine whether to revoke the franchise, and issue a written decision relating thereto, considering the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation as reflected by one or more of the following factors:

A. Whether the misconduct was egregious;

B. Whether substantial harm resulted;

C. Whether the violation was intentional;

D. Whether there is a history of prior violations of the same or other requirements;

E. Whether there is a history of overall compliance;

F. Whether the violation was voluntarily disclosed, admitted or cured. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).

Article IV. Small Wireless Deployment


15.22.450 Application process.

A. Overview. In order to manage its rights-of-way in a thoughtful manner which balances the need to accommodate new and evolving technologies with the preservation of the natural and aesthetic environment of the city, the city has adopted this administrative process for the deployment of small wireless facilities. The city and applicant for a franchise and other permits associated with the deployment of small wireless facilities face challenges in coordinating applicable legislative and administrative processes under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. A franchise for the use of the city’s right-of-way is a contract which requires approval by the city council. The small wireless permits are issued by the director of the planning department or his/her designee. Applicants are encouraged and expected to provide all related applications in one submittal, unless they have already obtained a franchise.

B. Application Process. The director of the public works department or his/her designee is authorized to establish franchise and other application forms to gather the information required by this chapter from applicants and to determine the completeness of the application process as provided herein. The application shall include Parts A, B, and C as described below.

1. Franchise. The process typically begins with and depends upon approval of a franchise for the use of the public right-of-way to deploy small wireless facilities if any portion of the applicant’s facilities is to be located in the right-of-way. A complete application for a franchise is designated as Part A. An applicant with a franchise for the deployment of small wireless facilities in the city may proceed to directly apply for a small wireless facility permit/right-of-way permit and related approvals (Parts B and C). An applicant at its option may utilize phased development. Because franchises are required by federal law to be competitively neutral, the city has established a franchise format for use by all right-of-way users.

2. Small Wireless Facility Permits/Right-of-Way Permits. Part B of the application requires specification of the small wireless facility components and locations as further required in the small wireless permit application described in Section 15.22.460.

3. Associated Permit(s). Part C of the application shall attach all associated permits’ requirements such as applications or check lists required under the critical areas, shoreline or SEPA ordinances. Applicants for deployment of small wireless facilities in city design zones or for new poles shall comply with the requirements in Section 17.70.100.

4. Leases. An applicant who desires to attach a small wireless facility to any utility pole or light owned by the city shall include an application for a lease as a component of its application. The director is authorized to approve leases in the form approved for general use by the city council for any utility pole or light pole in the right-of-way. Leases for the use of other public property, structures or facilities shall be submitted to the city council for approval. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.460 Small wireless permit application.

The following information shall be provided by all applicants for a small wireless permit:

A. The application shall provide specific locational information, including GIS coordinates of all proposed small wireless facilities, and specify where the small wireless facilities will utilize existing, replacement or new poles, towers, existing buildings and/or other structures. Ground-mounted equipment, conduit, and junction boxes must be detailed. Detailed schematics and visual renderings of the small wireless facilities, including engineering and design standards, shall be provided by the applicant. The application shall have sufficient detail to identify:

1. The location of overhead and underground public utility, telecommunication, cable, water, sewer drainage and other lines and equipment in the rights-of-way within two hundred fifty feet from the proposed site.

2. The specific trees, structures, facilities, lines and equipment and obstructions, if any, that applicant proposes to temporarily or permanently remove or relocate and a landscape plan for protecting, trimming, removing, replacing, and restoring any trees or areas to be disturbed during construction.

3. All existing proposed improvements related to the proposed location, including but not limited to poles, driveways, ADA ramps, equipment cabinets, street trees and structures within two hundred fifty feet from the proposed site.

4. If the site location includes a replacement or new light pole, then the applicant must submit a photometric analysis of the roadway and sidewalk one hundred fifty feet upstream and downstream of the existing light.

5. Compliance with the aesthetic requirements of Section 17.70.100.

B. The applicant must show written approval from the owner of any pole or structure for the installation of its small wireless facilities on such pole or structure. Such written approval shall include approval of the specific pole, engineering and design standards, as well as assurances that the specific pole can withstand wind and seismic loads, from the pole owner, unless the pole owner is the city. Submission of evidence of a lease agreement between the owner and the applicant is required. For city-owned poles or structures, the applicant must obtain a lease from the city prior to or concurrent with the small wireless permit application and must submit as part of the application the information required in the lease for the city to evaluate the usage of a specific pole.

C. The applicant can batch multiple small wireless facility sites in one application. The applicant is encouraged to batch the small wireless facility sites within an application in a contiguous service area.

D. Any application for a small wireless facility located in the right-of-way adjacent to a parcel zoned for residential use shall demonstrate that it has considered the following:

1. Whether a small wireless facility is currently installed on an existing pole in front of the same residential parcel. If a small wireless facility exists, then the applicant must demonstrate that no technically feasible alternative location exists which is not in front of the same residential parcel.

2. Whether the proposed small wireless facility can be screened from residential view by choosing a pole location that is not directly in front of a window or views.

E. Any application for a small wireless permit which contains an element which is not exempt from SEPA review shall simultaneously apply under Chapter 43.21C RCW. Further, any application proposing small wireless facilities in shoreline management zones or in critical areas must indicate that the application is exempt or comply with the review processes in such codes.

F. The applicant shall submit a sworn affidavit signed by an RF engineer with knowledge of the proposed project affirming that the small wireless facilities will be compliant with all FCC and other governmental regulations in connection with human exposure to radio frequency emissions for every frequency at which the small wireless facility will operate. If facilities which generate RF radiation necessary to the small wireless facility are to be provided by a third party, then the small wireless permit shall be conditioned on an RF certification showing the cumulative impact of the RF emissions on the entire installation. The applicant may provide one emissions report for the entire small wireless deployment if the applicant is using the same small wireless facility configuration for all installations within that batch or may submit one emissions report for each subgroup installation identified in the batch.

G. The applicant shall provide proof of FCC and other regulatory approvals required to provide the service(s) or utilize the technologies sought to be installed.

H. A professional engineer licensed by the state of Washington shall certify in writing, over his or her seal, that both construction plans and final construction of the small wireless facilities and structure or pole and foundation are designed to reasonably withstand wind and seismic loads.

I. A traffic control plan.

J. The small wireless facilities permit shall include those elements that are typically contained in the right-of-way use permit to allow the applicant to proceed with the build-out of the small wireless facility deployment.

K. Recognizing that small wireless facility technology is rapidly evolving, the director is authorized to adopt and publish standards for the technological and structural safety of city-owned structures and to formulate and publish application questions for use when an applicant seeks to attach to city-owned structures.

L. Such other information as the director, in his/her discretion, shall deem appropriate to effectively evaluate the application based on technical, engineering and aesthetic considerations. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.470 Review process.

A. Review. The following provisions relate to review of applications for a small wireless facility permit:

1. Only complete applications for a small wireless permit containing all required submission elements described in Section 15.22.460 shall be considered by the city. Incomplete applications that are not made complete by the applicant within sixty days of initial submission of the application materials shall be deemed withdrawn.

2. In any zone, upon application for a small wireless permit, the city will permit small wireless deployment on existing or replacement utility poles conforming to the city’s generally applicable development and design standard adopted pursuant to Section 17.70.100, except as provided in subsection B of this section.

3. Vertical clearance shall be reviewed by the director to ensure that the small wireless facilities will not pose a hazard to other users of the rights-of-way.

4. Replacement poles and new poles shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction and sidewalk clearance standards, traffic warrants, city ordinances, and state and federal statutes and regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the rights-of-way. Further, the location of any replacement pole or new pole must: be physically possible, cannot obstruct vehicular or pedestrian traffic or the clear zone, not interfere with utility or safety fixtures (e.g., fire hydrants, traffic control devices), and not adversely affect the public welfare, health, or safety.

5. No equipment shall be operated so as to produce noise in violation of the city’s noise standards.

6. Small wireless facilities may not encroach onto or over private property or property outside of the right-of-way without the property owner’s express written consent.

7. The city shall make every reasonable effort, consistent with any applicable provisions of state or federal law, and the preservation of the city’s health, safety and aesthetic environment, to comply with the federal presumptively reasonable time periods for review of facilities for the deployment of small wireless facilities to the fullest extent possible.

B. Small wireless deployment in areas designated as design zones pursuant to Section 17.70.100 as well as new noncity-owned poles, or replacement poles deviating from the pole design standards adopted pursuant to Section 17.70.100, are subject to review pursuant to Chapter 17.70.

C. Eligible Facilities Requests. The design approved in a small wireless facility permit shall be considered concealment elements and such facilities may only be expanded upon an eligible facilities request described in Section 17.70.030 when the modification does not defeat the concealment elements of the small wireless facility.

D. Review of Facilities. Review of the site locations proposed by the applicant shall be governed by the provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 253 and 47 U.S.C. § 332 and other applicable statutes, regulations and case law. Applicants for franchises and the small wireless facility permits shall be treated in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner with other service providers utilizing supporting infrastructure which is functionally equivalent, that is, service providers whose facilities are similarly situated in terms of structure, placement, or cumulative impacts. small wireless facility permit review under this chapter shall neither prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting the ability of an applicant to provide telecommunications services.

E. Final Decision. Any decision by the director shall be final and not be subject to administrative appeals.

F. Public Comment. The city shall provide notice of a complete application for a small wireless facility permit on the city’s website with a link to the application. The notice shall include an email contact and telephone number for the applicant to answer citizen inquiries. The applicant is encouraged to host informational meetings for the public regarding the deployment. The city shall post meeting notices, if any, for informational meetings on its website. These meetings are for the public’s information and are neither hearings nor part of any land use appeal process.

G. Withdrawal. Any applicant may withdraw an application submitted pursuant to Section 15.22.460 at any time, provided the withdrawal is in writing and signed by all persons who signed the original application or their successors in interest. When a withdrawal is received, the application shall be deemed null and void. If such withdrawal occurs prior to the director of public works or his/her designee’s decision, then reimbursement of fees submitted in association with said application shall be prorated to withhold the amount of city costs incurred in processing the application prior to time of withdrawal. If such withdrawal is not accomplished prior to the director of public works or his/her designee’s decision, there shall be no refund of all or any portion of such fee. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.480 Permit requirements.

A. The grantee of any permit shall comply with all of the requirements within the small wireless permit.

B. Small wireless facilities installed pursuant to a small wireless facility permit may proceed to install the approved small wireless facilities without the need for an additional right-of-way use permit if construction is commenced within thirty days of approval by providing email or written notice to the director. Facilities approved in a small wireless permit in which installation has not commenced within thirty days of the approval of a small wireless facility permit shall apply for and be issued a right-of-way use permit to install such small wireless facilities in accordance with the standard requirements of the city for use of the right-of-way.

C. Post-Construction As-Builts. Within thirty days after construction of the small wireless facility, the grantee shall provide the city with as-builts of the small wireless facilities demonstrating compliance with the permit and site photographs.

D. Permit Time Limit. Construction of the small wireless facility must be completed within six months after the approval date by the city, except where the delay is caused by the fiber and/or power providers. The grantee may request one extension to be limited to six months, if the applicant cannot construct the small wireless facility within the original six-month period.

E. Site Safety and Maintenance. The grantee must maintain the small wireless facilities in safe and working condition. The grantee shall be responsible for the removal of any graffiti or other vandalism and shall keep the site neat and orderly, including but not limited to following any maintenance or modifications on the site. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.490 Modifications to small wireless facilities.

A. If a grantee desires to make a modification to an existing small wireless facility, including but not limited to expanding or changing the antenna type, increasing the equipment enclosure, placing additional pole-mounted or ground-mounted equipment, or modifying the concealment elements, then the applicant shall apply for a small wireless facility permit.

B. A small wireless facility permit shall not be required for routine maintenance and repair of a small wireless facility within the rights-of-way, or the replacement of an antenna or equipment of similar size, weight, and height; provided, that such replacement does not defeat the concealment elements used in the original deployment of the small wireless facility, does not impact the structural integrity of the pole, and does not require pole replacement. Further, a small wireless facility permit shall not be required for replacing equipment within the equipment enclosure or reconfiguration of fiber or power to the small wireless facility. Right-of-way use permits may be required for such routine maintenance, repair or replacement. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.500 Consolidated permit.

The issuance of a small wireless permit grants authority to construct small wireless facilities in the rights-of-way in a consolidated manner to allow the applicant, in most situations, to avoid the need to seek duplicative approval by both the public works and the planning departments. If the applicant requires a new franchise to utilize the right-of-way, the franchise approval may be consolidated with the small wireless facility permit review if requested by the applicant. As an exercise of police powers pursuant to RCW 35.99.040(2), the small wireless facility permit is not a right-of-way use permit, but instead a consolidated public works and land use permit and the issuance of a small wireless facility permit shall be governed by the time limits established by federal law for small wireless facilities. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).

Article V. Fees


15.22.510 Application and review fee.

Any applicant for a franchise pursuant to this chapter shall pay an application and review fee or fee deposit in an amount as determined by the city council. This application and review fee covers the actual costs associated with the city’s initial review of the application; provided, however, that the applicant shall be required to pay all necessary permit fees. This application and review fee shall be deposited with the city as part of the application filed pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.520 Other city costs.

The telecommunications carrier shall prepare and maintain a tree trimming schedule to ensure compliance with this provision and to avoid exigent circumstances where tree cutting, trimming or removal is necessary to protect the public safety or continuity of service without the regard for the appearance, integrity or health of the trees that planned maintenance would otherwise allow. The telecommunications carrier shall submit the schedule and a plan showing the location of tree trimming activities and a description of techniques and methodology used in such tree trimming to the director. Except where exigent circumstances do not permit, the telecommunications carrier or public utility shall give the owner the property on which the trees are located at least five business days’ advance written notice of the tree trimming. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).


15.22.570 Joint trenching.

Recognizing that trenching and excavation within public rightsofway can significantly degrade the quality and longevity of street surfacing and seriously inconvenience the public, all grantees shall afford other telecommunications carriers, public utilities, and the city an opportunity to share in the use of their excavations and trenches within public rightsofway. In the event that the city, a telecommunications carrier, or a public utility desires to share in a grantee’s excavation, it shall provide a written request to do so. Joint use of excavations shall be subject to the following conditions:

A. Such joint use shall not unreasonably delay the work of the party causing the excavation to be made;

B. A grantee desiring to share in an excavation may be required to pay the fair and reasonable pro rata cost of said excavation. Such joint use shall be arranged and accomplished on terms and conditions satisfactory to both parties; and

C. Either party may deny such request for safety reasons. (Ord. 1561 § 3 (Exh. A) (part), 2019).1

16.24.040 Approval constitutes development authorization.

 Approval of the general binding site plan constitutes authorization for the applicant to develop the improvements according to the approval. Approval shall not imply approval to convey lots. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.24.050 Forms and filing of general binding site plan.

 A. Within twelve months of approval of a general binding site plan, the applicant shall submit one reproducible and six copies of the general binding site plan to the administrator for signature attesting to consistency with the approved general binding site plan.

B. The general binding site plan shall contain a certificate giving a correct description of the perimeter of the land to be divided as it appears on the general binding site plan and acknowledgment that future subdivision of the land encompassed within the general binding site plan boundary may occur through the recording of a specific binding site plan and that said subdivision may have a different lot configuration than that shown on the binding site plan within areas designated for lot development.

C. The certificate shall include a statement that the general binding site plan has been made with the free consent and in accordance with the desires of all parties with ownership interest. If the general binding site plan is subject to dedication, the certificate or a separate written instrument shall contain the dedication of all streets and other areas to the public, an individual(s), religious society(ies) or to any corporation, public or private as shown on the certificate, and a waiver of all claims for damages against any governmental authority which may be occasioned to the adjacent land by the established construction, drainage and maintenance of said road. The certificate or instrument of dedication shall be signed and acknowledged before a notary public by all parties having ownership interest in the lands divided and recorded. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.24.060 Specific binding site plan procedure.

 A. Application for approval of a specific binding site plan as to part or all of the land covered by the general binding site plan shall be filed with the administrator at such time as the property owner(s) intends to sell or lease a portion of property approved in a general binding site plan. The process of review and approval of a specific binding site plan shall not be used to modify the provisions of the approved general binding site plan other than to divide lots for sale or lease within areas designated for lot development in the general binding site plan.

B. The specific binding site plan shall be reviewed for compliance with the conditions of the general binding site plan, and all other applicable regulations in effect at the time of application for approval of the specific binding site plan. Upon determination of consistency, the specific binding site plan shall be signed by the administrator and filed with the auditor. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.24.070 Effect of approval.

 After a binding site plan is filed with the auditor, all persons, parties, and their successors, heirs or assigns, who own, have, or will have by virtue of purchase, inheritance or assignment any interest in the real property of the subject site or portions thereof, shall be bound by the conditions and inscriptions attending the binding site plan. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.24.080 Alterations.

 Alterations to a general or specific binding site plan that expand the boundaries, change the primary use, modify access location, require over fifty percent reconfiguration of streets, or other utilities, or modify the provisions for approval, shall be modified in accordance with the approval process set out in this chapter for the original general or subsequent specific binding site plan.

16.32.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide the criteria for the review and approval of adjustments to boundary lines between two or more lots or tracts. The intent of a boundary line adjustment is to rectify defects in legal descriptions, to address existing problems pertaining to building encroachment, irregular shaped lots, or substandard lot sizes or to modify lot lines to promote orderly and efficient community growth. A boundary line adjustment may not be used to accomplish the purposes for which platting, replatting, plat alterations or plat vacations are intended and required. A boundary line adjustment shall be reviewed and approved by the administrator as a Type IB project permit application under the development regulations. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.32.020 Limitation.

Boundary lines may only be adjusted between the following lots:

A. Lots created by a recorded land division;

B. Lots exempt from the land division code under Section 16.04.030;

C. Lots previously adjusted pursuant to this chapter; or

D. Lots conveyed by written instrument prior to October 17, 2000. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.32.030 Application.

A. Application. Application for a boundary line adjustment shall not include a land division map, but shall include a record survey for a boundary line adjustment, drawn to scale and accurately dimensioned, clearly showing the following information:

1. Names, addresses, phone numbers of the owner(s) of record of the lots to be adjusted;

2. Assessor parcel numbers for all affected lots;

3. The area and dimensions of each lot; and location and dimensions of all tracts, private or public roads, easements, any drain field(s), or wellhead protection areas that are within or adjacent to any affected lot;

4. All boundary lines shall be referenced with proper bearings and distances;

5. Zoning of lots;

6. Drawing to scale indicating the present boundary line as dashed and the proposed boundary line as solid, both referenced with proper bearings and distances;

7. Present and proposed legal description of the lots to be adjusted, as prepared by a land surveyor; with legal descriptions for the conveyances necessary to complete the adjustment.

B. Additional Documents. A boundary line application shall include the following, in addition to the information in subsection A of this section:

1. A statement of indemnification, consent and waiver of claims, executed by the owner(s) of record of the lots to be adjusted;

2. A plat certificate issued within thirty days prior to the application confirming that the title to the lands subject to the boundary line adjustment are vested with the owner(s) of record;

3. Instruments providing for the conveyance of the adjusted lots by and to the owner(s) of record, with legal descriptions prepared by a land surveyor. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.32.040 Criteria.

The boundary lines separating two or more lots of record may be adjusted under the provisions of this chapter; provided, that such adjustment:

A. Shall not result in the creation of any additional lots or tracts;

B. Shall not create any lot or tract which contains insufficient area and dimensions to meet the requirements for width and area for a building site as established herein, nor shall such adjustment or adjustments create a building setback violation;

C. Shall not adversely affect access, easements or drain fields;

D. Shall not result in any lot being smaller than the minimum lot size required by the zoning code in effect at the time the application is accepted. Whenever any one or more lots involved in the proposed change is smaller than the minimum lot size of the current zoning designation, the change may be approved so long as no resulting lot becomes more nonconforming than the smallest lot prior to the boundary line adjustment;

E. Shall not reduce the overall area in a land division reserved or devoted to open space, parks, or similar requirement;

F. Shall not modify a boundary of a recorded land division;

G. Shall not violate or be inconsistent with any restrictions or conditions of approval for any previously approved land division; and

H. Shall not result in the entire relocation of lots or tracts. Lots may be reoriented within the perimeter of the contiguous lots. (Ord. 1397 § 8 (Exh. 7) (part), 2009).


16.32.050 Approval and recording.

Upon the administrator determining the proposed boundary line adjustment satisfies the requirements of this chapter, the administrator shall endorse the completed application, notify the owner(s) of record, and shall record the completed application and the instruments of conveyance with the auditor. A boundary line adjustment shall not be considered approved until the boundary line adjustment plan has been filed by the administrator with the auditor. The signature of approval by the administrator shall constitute approval by the city for recording of the boundary line adjustment. The applicant shall be responsible for all recording fees.

16.36.140 Condominium conversion.



A. Density. Condominium conversions shall be consistent with the underlying density of the zone. The city may approve a density consistent with the current density of the condominium conversion, if higher than the base zone, provided ten percent of the units are designated as affordable to households earning eighty percent or less of the county area median income. Affordable units shall be subject to minimum fifty-year deed restrictions to ensure long-term use and affordability. All deed restrictions are subject to review and approval by the administrator and city attorney and shall be recorded with the Chelan County auditor.

17.04.010 Short title.

This title shall be known and may be cited as “The city of Chelan Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.” (Ord. 314 § 1 (1), 1962).


17.04.020 Content – Interpretation.

This title shall consist of the text hereof and in addition thereto, a zoning map identified by the appropriate signature of the chairman of the city of Chelan planning commission and council of the city of Chelan. Said title and each and all of its terms are to be read and interpreted in the light of the commitments of said zoning map. If any conflict of the zoning map and text should arise, the text of this title shall prevail. (Ord. 314 § 1 (2), 1962).


17.04.025 Definitions.

Words and phrases appearing in this chapter shall have the meanings set out in Section 19.10.040. (Ord. 1411 § 6(d), 2010).


17.04.030 General purposes.

The general purposes of this title are to:

A. Promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare;

B. Assist in the implementation of the comprehensive plan of the city. (Ord. 314 § 2 (1), 1962).


17.04.040 District classifications.

In keeping with the provisions of Section VII of Chapter 44, Laws of Washington, 1935, as amended, the specific purpose of this title is to classify all territory within the corporate limits of the city into the following districts:

A. R-L – Single-Family Residential District. The R-L District is intended to preserve existing housing stock and provide residential development opportunities for predominantly single-family detached dwelling units. The R-L designation promotes standards that preserve the natural landscape of hillsides and ravines and other critical areas, reduce the risk of geologic and fire hazards, and conserve designated public views. This designation is intended to be applied in areas suitable and desirable for residential use, which are or will become developed by single-family dwellings. Lands should be adequately served at the time of development with roads, utility services and other public facilities commensurate with anticipated population and dwelling unit densities.

B. R-M – Multi-Family Residential District. The purpose of the R-M District is to provide for a mix of residential uses at a broad range of dwelling unit densities that appeal to a variety of income categories and lifestyles. R-M recognizes existing multi-family neighborhoods and offers opportunities for new housing. R-M is applied where access, topography, and adjacent land uses create conditions appropriate for a variety of attached and detached unit types, or where there is existing multi-family development. Such lands should be adequately served at the time of development with roads, utility services and other public facilities commensurate with anticipated population and dwelling unit densities.

C. C-HS – Highway Service Commercial District. The C-HS District provides necessary commercial services to the traveling public and heavy commercial uses not oriented to walk-in convenience shopping. C-HS provides opportunities for vertical or horizontal mixed use housing opportunities which help to make a more vibrant commercial district. The C-HS designation is intended to be applied to lands along principal arterials outside the downtown master plan area with a character of highway-oriented commercial uses.

D. C-W – Waterfront Commercial District. This designation provides areas on lakefront property for heavy waterfront commercial uses. This district is applied to properties along the Lake Chelan shoreline that function as a working waterfront with water-oriented commercial uses.

E. W-I – Warehousing and Industrial District. The W-I District provides appropriately located areas for various warehouse and industrial uses that enhance the city’s economic base, and provide jobs for residents of the area, while at the same time ensuring a high quality of life free from excessive dust, noise, odors, smoke, heavy traffic congestion, and air and water pollution. The W-I District is applied in areas suitable for warehouse and industrial uses which are or will be developed by industries that are not detrimental to agriculture or recreation in the Lake Chelan area and that are located outside the downtown master plan area. W-I is applied to larger land holdings that are topographically level, with arterial transportation access, and where such developments can be designed in a compatible manner. Primary uses include agricultural production, manufacturing enterprises, warehousing, industrial establishments, and compatible commercial services. Secondary uses include workforce housing that is accessory to principal uses and conditionally allowed live-work developments.

F. T-A – Tourist Accommodations District. The purpose of the T-A District is to promote lodging, resort, leisure, and hospitality uses that serve the traveling and recreation-oriented public. This designation is intended to be applied in areas near or adjacent to Lake Chelan or other natural or recreational resources which are uniquely suited for motels, hotels, lodges and similar uses in keeping with the importance of the recreation industry to the city.

G. PDD – Planned Development District. The purpose of this zoning overlay district is to: encourage a variety of mixture of housing types; compatible mixed uses; imaginative site and building design; usable open space for the enjoyment of the occupants and the general public; retention of significant features of the natural environment, including waterways and views; efficiency in the layout of streets and utility networks and other improvements; and “complete streets” that incorporate pedestrian, bicycling, and transit options. The overlay requires that the proposed development result in a significantly higher quality of design, generate more of a public benefit, and be more environmentally sensitive than would have been the case with the use of standard zoning and other development regulations, while ensuring substantial compliance with the goals and policies of the Chelan comprehensive plan.

H. A – Airport District. The Airport (A) District allows for a variety of mixed airport type uses for the airport property including: providing the leasing of lots at the airport for hangars, helipads and possibly some light manufacturing, assembly or for business uses. Airport designation regulations discourage the siting of incompatible uses adjacent to the airport.

I. SUD – Special Use District. The SUD District is designed to: (1) support and enhance agricultural operations and their essential pastoral setting, (2) allow low impact tourist commercial and educational uses at a scale that is complementary to agricultural pursuits, and (3) provide an opportunity for lower density residential housing. Densities allowed serve as a transition from the rural area to the urban area and reinforce an urban separator character. The SUD permits clustering and planned residential developments to conserve valuable resource and environmentally sensitive lands such as agricultural lands, steep slopes, streams and ravines, and others, while allowing for appropriate development. Where clustering is allowed, structures are concentrated on a portion of the site with the majority area conserved for resource or open space uses. SUD includes standards that minimize farm/nonfarm development conflicts, and ensures building heights and forms are visually compatible with surrounding uses.

J. P – Public Lands and Facilities. The PLF District promotes both passive and active recreation, and provides suitable locations for public facilities. The district applies to lands and facilities under public ownership and use or private institutions. The PLF is not applicable to commercial amusement parks and other such activities. Secondarily, the zone conditionally allows special needs and affordable housing.

K. DT – Downtown Planning Area. This designation applies to property within the downtown planning area, and intends to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the Chelan downtown master plan. (Ord. 1533 § 6 (Exh. 13) (part), 2017: Ord. 1410 § 5, 2010; Ord. 1114 § 4, 1998; Ord. 983 § 2, 1994; Ord. 469 § 1, 1974; Ord. 314 § 2 (2), 1962).

F. No structure will be allowed closer than five feet from any property line within the rear yard.

G. In residential districts on lots which were lots of record prior to the passage of this title, and which contain less than the required width and/or less than the required minimum lot area, but contain an area of no less than four thousand square feet and a minimum width of lot at building line of no less than forty feet, a building permit may be issued by the administrator of this title without a hearing before the board of adjustment; provided that the structure built on this building lot of record, of less than minimum width at building line and/or minimum lot area, will meet all of the remaining dimensional standards required in the district in which the structure is located. (Ord. 314 § 15 (B) (1), 1962).

17.04.063 Cryptocurrency, data mining, and high density load electric users. No building, structure, real property or premises in any land use district shall be used for high demand load electric computing for the purposes of cryptocurrency mining operations, data mining, or similar high consumptive users of electrical loads where the purpose of the computing operations is to solve algorithms where the operating square footage as determined by the utility is in excess of two hundred fifty kilowatt hours per square foot per year for all equipment necessary to operate and cool such activities. Building permit applicants for business activities that require high density load for industrial, manufacturing, and computing such as data storage farms shall be considered on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the public utility district and the land use administrator. (Ord. 1550 § 2 (Exh. B), 2018).


17.04.065 Livestock and poultry. 

A. Small stock animals, defined as any combination of four rabbits or chickens, are permitted on less than an acre and shall be housed within an enclosed structure that is set back ten feet from side yard property lines and are prohibited within the front yard setback area.

2. The nearest point on the property line of a public park; or

3. The nearest point on the property line of the lot containing an adult entertainment facility, a public library, public or private nursery school or preschool, public or private primary or secondary school, day care, community youth center, or place of worship.

D. Variances. Whenever the applicant for an adult entertainment facility believes that the separation requirements set forth in this section are not necessary to achieve an effective degree of physical separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and the zoning districts and uses identified in subsection B of this section, the applicant shall have the right to apply for a variance from the separation requirements subject to the procedures set forth in Chapter 17.64, Variances and upon payment of the applicable fee for a variance application. In determining whether a variance should be granted, the board of adjustment shall consider the following criteria in addition to the variance criteria set forth in Chapter 17.64, Variances:

1. The extent to which physical features would result in an effective separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and any zoning districts or uses identified in subsection B of this section in terms of visibility and access;

Otherwise, the variance application shall be denied.

E. Nonconforming Adult Entertainment Facilities. An adult entertainment facility shall be deemed a nonconforming use and shall be subject to the requirements of Chapter 17.68, Nonconforming Uses, if a zoning district or use identified in subsection B of this section locates within five hundred feet of such adult entertainment facility after the date that such adult entertainment facility has located within the city in accordance with the requirements of this section.

Chapter 17.14 CHELAN DOWNTOWN LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT CODE

Sections:

17.14.010    Administration.

17.14.020    Regulating plan – Land use districts and site orientation standards.

17.14.030    Site planning and design elements.

17.14.040    Building design.

17.14.050    Housing type standards.

17.14.060    Definitions.


17.14.010 Administration.

A. Purpose. The downtown code was authorized by the city council as a major implementation tool of Chelan’s downtown master plan. Overall, the code intends to:

1. Provide clear objectives for those embarking on the planning and design of projects in downtown Chelan.

2. To preserve and enhance downtown’s historic resources and character.

3. To ensure that new mixed-use and commercial development is of high quality and appropriate to downtown’s character.

4. To retain the generally small scale residential quality of residential areas.

5. To upgrade the visual appearance of downtown’s principal vehicular corridors.

6. To promote increased pedestrian, bicycling, and transit use downtown.

7. To increase awareness of design considerations among the citizens of Chelan.

8. To maintain and enhance property values within Chelan.

B. Applicability and Compliance. The downtown code provisions herein are intended to supplement other provisions of this title and other existing city codes applicable to developments. Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and other codes, the provisions herein shall apply as determined by the director.

Unless otherwise noted, code provisions in this chapter apply to all construction within the downtown planning area (see Figure 1). This includes master plans, planned unit developments, subdivisions, and new construction. Different sections within this chapter often apply only to specific types of development (such as commercial or multi-family development) and are thus clearly noted. New construction must comply with the code provisions in this chapter.

For additions and remodels, three different thresholds have been established to gauge how the standards herein are applied to such projects:

1. Level I remodels/additions include all exterior remodels and additions commenced within a three-year period that affect the exterior appearance of the building and/or increase the building’s footprint by up to fifty percent. The requirement for such remodels/additions is only that the proposed addition and improvements meet the standards and do not lead to further nonconformance with the standards. For example, if a property owner decides to replace a building facade’s siding, then the siding shall meet the applicable exterior building material standards, but elements such as building articulation would not be required.

2. Level II additions include all building additions commenced within a three-year period that increase the building’s footprint by more than fifty percent, but not greater than one hundred percent. All standards that do not involve repositioning the building or reconfiguring site development, as determined by the director, shall apply to Level II additions. For example, if a property owner of an existing home on Chelan Avenue wants to convert the home to a business and build an addition equaling seventy-five percent of the current building’s footprint, then the following elements shall apply:

a. The location and design of the addition/remodel shall be consistent with landscape street frontages per Section 17.14.020(D): Provide a landscaped setback, locate parking to side or rear of building addition, provide weather protection over the building entry, and meet minimum facade transparency requirement.

b. Provide clear access to the sidewalk from the building entry and meet other applicable pedestrian access provisions per Section 17.14.030(D).

c. Comply with applicable service area and mechanical equipment, lighting, and parking lot design standards per Sections 17.14.030(F) through (H).

d. Comply with applicable architectural character standards in Section 17.14.040(B).

e. The building addition shall comply with architectural scale provisions of Section 17.14.040(C).

f. The entire building shall comply with building elements/details, materials, and blank wall treatment standards of Sections 17.14.040(D) through (F).

3. Level III additions include all building additions commenced within a three-year period that increase the building’s footprint by more than one hundred percent. Such additions shall conform to all standards.

Figure 1. Downtown planning area.

C. How the Code Is Applied. Most sections contain a list of “Intent” statements followed by “Standards” and/or “Guidelines” specifically:

1. Intent statements are overarching objectives. For example, one of the intent statements for the section on building location and orientation is to “Create an active and safe pedestrian environment.”

2. Standards use words such as “shall,” “must,” and “is/are required” signifying required actions.

3. Guidelines use words such as “should” or “is/are recommended” signifying voluntary measures.

4. Departures are provided for some standards. They allow alternative designs subject to administrative approval by the director provided they meet the intent of the standards and guidelines. The director shall document reasons for approving all departures (to be maintained with project application records) for the purpose of providing consistency in decision-making by the city.

Furthermore, the document contains some specific standards that are easily quantifiable, while others provide a level of discretion in how they are complied with. In the latter case, the applicant must demonstrate to the director, in writing, how the project meets the intent of the standard.

D. Review Process.

1. Development review processes shall be as set forth in Title 19, except that any building permit applicants seeking departures to the provisions in this chapter shall be reviewed as a Type IIA permit approved by the director. The director may request assistance by the planning commission, Historic Downtown Chelan Association (or other similar organization), or design professionals in determining whether projects comply with the standards herein.

2. Verification of Historic Downtown Chelan Association Review.

a. To provide the Historic Downtown Association (HDCA) the opportunity to provide input to the administrator for projects located on storefront streets as identified on the regulating map at Section 17.14.020(B), the developer shall submit the proposed project to the HDCA design committee to verify conformance with this chapter.

b. As a condition to the administrator accepting a project permit application for projects described in subsection (D)(2)(a) of this section, the application shall include (i) HDCA’s verification of its review, (ii) proof that thirty days elapsed after submitting the project to HDCA and that no verification was provided, or (iii) proof the design committee is inactive.

c. Verification of the project permit application by HDCA shall not be determinative of the project’s compliance with this chapter, but is limited to ensuring HDCA has had an opportunity to review a project permit application to provide input to the director regarding a proposed project.

d. For purposes of this chapter, a building permit application shall include applications for exterior remodels, departures, additions and new building(s).

E. How to Use This Downtown Code.

1. First, review Section 17.14.020, Regulating plan – Land use districts and site orientation standards, and map (Figure 2) to determine which land use district your property is within and what type of street your property fronts onto. Then review the standards that apply to the applicable land use district and street type designation within this section. The land use district standards (Sections 17.14.020(C)(2) and (3)) identify permitted uses, maximum building heights, setback requirements, and minimum open space requirements. Site orientation standards (Section 17.14.020(D)) identify what types of building frontages are allowed and where off-street parking is allowed.

2. Next steps depend on what type of development is proposed.

a. Nonresidential and multi-family developments must comply with the following sections unless otherwise noted:

 

	17.14.030	Site Planning and Design Elements

(which address design of side and rear yards, open space, walkways, large site development, service areas and mechanical equipment, lighting, parking lot design, and pedestrian amenities)

	17.14.040	Building Design

(which address design of buildings, including character, scale, details, materials, etc.)

b. Single-family, duplexes and triplexes, accessory dwelling units, cottage housing, and townhouses shall comply with the applicable subsection of Section 17.14.050.

Townhouses are considered a type of multi-family use, and thus are subject to Sections 17.14.030 and 17.14.040 unless otherwise noted and applicable provisions of Section 17.14.050. (Ord. 1410 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2010).


17.14.020 Regulating plan – Land use districts and site orientation standards.

A. Purpose. This section establishes land use districts and street type designations together with standards for each district and street type to guide the development of downtown Chelan properties consistent with the vision of the downtown master plan.

B. Regulating Map.

1. The regulating map (Figure 2) designates the locations for five downtown land use districts, indicates applicable height limits, and designates the locations of four different street types.

a. Downtown Mixed-Use (DMU). The purpose of the DMU District is to provide for a pedestrian-oriented mix of commercial, mixed-uses, and residential uses.

b. Tourist Mixed-Use (TMU). The purpose of the TMU District is to provide for residential uses and tourist-oriented uses in a pedestrian-friendly setting.

c. Downtown Mixed Residential (DMR). The purpose of the DMR District is to provide for a mix of residential uses that build on the established historical development patterns within the downtown area.

d. Downtown Single-Family (DSF). The purpose of the DSF District is to maintain the established single-family character of these areas.

e. Public. The purpose of the public district is to provide for public uses within the downtown planning area.

2. Permitted Uses.

a. Interpretation of Permitted Use Table (Table 1).

i. If no symbol appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is not allowed in that district, except for certain temporary uses.

ii. If the letter “P” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is allowed in that district subject to the review procedures specified in Title 19 and the general requirements of the code.

iii. If the letter “C” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is allowed subject to the conditional use review procedures specified in Title 19, the conditional use standards in Chapter 17.56, and the general requirements of the code.

iv. If a number appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is subject to the specific conditions indicated in the development condition with the corresponding number immediately following the land use table.

v. The director shall determine whether a proposed land use not specifically listed in a land use table is allowed in a district. The director’s determination shall be based on whether or not permitting the proposed use in a particular district is consistent with the purposes of this title and the district’s purpose as set forth above, by considering the following factors:

(A) The physical characteristics of the use and its supporting structures, including but not limited to scale, traffic and other impacts, and hours of operation;

(B) Whether or not the use complements or is compatible with other uses permitted in the district; and

All nonresidential development on sites more than one acre in size, including commercial portions of mixed-use development, shall provide pedestrian-oriented open space equal to at least one percent of the net project area plus one percent of the gross nonresidential building floor area, exclusive of structured parking. The intent is to mitigate the impacts of large scale commercial development and to contribute to the pedestrian-oriented character of downtown. Pedestrian-oriented space shall comply with the design provisions of subsection (C)(1) of this section. See Figure 14 for an example.


[IMAGE]


Figure 14. Illustrating the amount of open space required for nonresidential development.

3. Pedestrian-Oriented Open Space Design Criteria. These spaces, as required per Section 17.14.020(C)(2), are intended to be publicly accessible spaces that enliven the pedestrian environment by providing (1) opportunities for outdoor dining, socializing, relaxing and (2) visual amenities that contribute to the unique character of downtown. Design criteria for pedestrian open space:

a. Sidewalk area, where widened beyond minimum requirements, shall count as pedestrian-oriented open space. The additional sidewalk area may be used for outdoor dining and temporary display of retail goods. The standards in subsections (C)(3)(b) and (c) of this section shall not apply to sidewalks, where used as usable open space;

b. The following design elements are required for pedestrian-oriented open space:

i. Spaces shall be physically and visually accessible from the adjacent street or major internal vehicle or pedestrian route. Spaces shall be in locations that the intended user can easily access and use, rather than simply leftover or undevelopable spaces where very little pedestrian traffic is anticipated;

ii. Paved walking surfaces of either concrete or approved unit paving;

iii. Pedestrian-scaled lighting (no more than fourteen feet in height) at a level averaging at least two foot-candles throughout the space. Lighting may be on site or building-mounted lighting;

iv. At least three feet of seating area (bench, ledge, etc.) or one individual seat per sixty square feet of plaza area or open space. This provision may be relaxed or waived where there are provisions for movable seating that meet the intent of the standard as determined by the director;

v. Spaces shall be positioned in areas with significant pedestrian traffic to provide interest and security – such as adjacent to a building entry; and

vi. Landscaping that adds visual or seasonal interest to the space.


[IMAGE]


Figure 15. Examples of pedestrian-oriented open spaces.

c. The following features are encouraged in pedestrian-oriented space:

i. Pedestrian amenities such as a water feature, drinking fountain, and/or distinctive paving or artwork;

ii. Provide pedestrian-oriented facades on some or all buildings facing the space;

iii. Consideration of the sun angle at noon and the wind pattern in the design of the space;

iv. Transitional zones along building edges to allow for outdoor eating areas and a planted buffer;

v. Movable seating;

vi. Incorporation of water treatment features such as rain gardens or the use of an area over a vault as a pedestrian-oriented space; and

vii. Weather protection, especially weather protection that can be moved or altered to accommodate conditions.

d. The following features are prohibited within pedestrian-oriented space:

i. Asphalt or gravel pavement, except where continuous gravel or asphalt paths intersect with the space;

ii. Adjacent chain link fences;

iii. Adjacent blank walls; and

iv. Adjacent dumpsters or service areas.

4. Open Space Requirements for Multi-Family Uses. All multi-family development, including multi-family portions of mixed-use development, shall provide open space at least equal to ten percent of the building living space, not counting corridors, lobbies, etc. For example, for an eight-unit development where the units average one thousand square feet, the minimum required open space shall be eight hundred square feet. The required open space may be provided in a combination of the following ways:

Trees and pedestrian-scaled lighting (maximum fifteen feet in height) shall be used to clearly define pedestrian walkways or other pedestrian areas within the parking area.


[IMAGE]


Figure 19. Parking lot pathway standards and example.

5. Internal Walkway Widths and Design.

a. Pathways along the front facade of mixed-use and retail buildings one hundred feet or more in length (measured along the facade) that are not located adjacent to a street must be at least twelve feet wide with eight feet minimum unobstructed width and include the following:

i. Street trees, as approved by the director, shall be placed at an average of thirty feet on center and placed in grates (except where trees are placed in planting strips). Breaks in the tree coverage will be allowed near major building entries to enhance visibility. However, no less than one tree per sixty lineal feet of building facade must be provided;

ii. Planting strips may be used between any vehicular access or parking area and the pathway; provided, that the required trees are included and the pathway is at least eight feet in width and the combined pathway and planting strip is at least fourteen feet in width; and

iii. Pedestrian-scaled lighting may be used as a substitute to the required street trees subject to director approval, provided they are used at the same intervals.

b. For all other interior pathways, the applicant shall successfully demonstrate that the proposed walkway is of sufficient width to accommodate the anticipated number of users. See Figure 21 for considerations.


[IMAGE]


Figure 21. Considerations for pathway walking widths.

6. Pedestrian Crossings.

a. Crosswalks are required when a walkway crosses a paved area accessible to vehicles; and

b. Applicants must continue the sidewalk pattern and material across driveways.

E. Large Site Development Standards. All development permit applications for sites over one acre or with multiple buildings, except for single-family development, shall demonstrate that the project is based on a unifying site planning concept that meets the following criteria:

1. Incorporates open space and landscaping as a unifying element;

2. Where possible, incorporates screening, utilities, and drainage as positive elements;

3. Provides pedestrian paths or walkways connecting all businesses and the entries of multiple buildings; and

4. Building entrances shall not be focused around a central parking lot but be connected by a sidewalk/pathway system and/or open space(s).

F. Service Areas and Mechanical Equipment.

1. Intent.

a. To minimize the potential negative impacts of service elements.

b. To encourage thoughtful siting of service elements that balance functional needs with the desire to screen negative impacts.

2. Service Element Location and Design. All developments shall provide a designated spot for service elements (refuse and disposal). Such elements shall meet the following requirements:

a. Service elements shall be located to minimize the negative visual, noise, odor, and physical impacts to the street environment, adjacent (on- and off-site) residents or other uses, and pedestrian areas;

b. The designated spot for service elements shall be paved with concrete;


[IMAGE]


Figure 22. Appropriate service area location and enclosure example.

c. Appropriate enclosure of the common trash and recycling elements shall be required, as determined by the director. Requirements and considerations:

i. Service areas visible from the street, pathway, pedestrian-oriented space or public parking area (alleys are exempt) shall be enclosed and screened around their perimeter by a durable wall or fence at least six feet high. Developments shall use materials and detailing consistent with primary structures on site. Acceptable materials include brick, concrete block or stone;

ii. The sides and rear of the enclosure must be screened with Type A, B, or C landscaping at least five feet deep in visible locations as determined by the director to soften the views of the screening element and add visual interest;

iii. Collection points shall be located and configured so that the enclosure gate swing does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or does not require that a hauling truck project into any public right-of-way;

iv. Proximity to adjacent residential units will be a key factor in determining appropriate service element treatment; and

v. Preferably, service enclosures are integrated into the building itself.

3. Utility Meters, Electrical Conduit, and Other Service Utility Apparatus. These elements shall be located and/or designed to minimize their visibility to the public. Project designers are strongly encouraged to coordinate with applicable service providers early in the design process to determine the best approach in meeting these standards. If such elements are mounted in a location visible from the street, pedestrian pathway, common open space, or shared auto courtyards, they shall be screened with vegetation or by architectural features.


[IMAGE]


Figure 23. Good and bad utility meter configurations. The examples on the left are consolidated and somewhat screened by landscaping elements, whereas the right examples are exposed and degrade the character of these townhomes.

4. Rooftop Mechanical Equipment. All rooftop mechanical equipment shall be organized, proportioned, detailed, screened, landscaped (with decks or terraces) and/or colored to be an integral element of the building and minimize visual impacts from the ground level of adjacent streets and properties. For example, screening features should utilize similar building materials and forms to blend with the architectural character of the building.


[IMAGE]


Figure 24. Screening examples of rooftop mechanical equipment.

G. Lighting.

1. Intent.

a. To encourage the judicious use of lighting in conjunction with other security methods to increase site safety.

b. To encourage the use of lighting as an integral design component to enhance buildings, landscaping, and other site features.

c. To encourage night sky visibility and to reduce the general illumination of the sky in Chelan.

d. To reduce the horizontal glare and vertical light trespass from a development onto adjacent parcels and natural features.

e. To discourage the use of lighting for advertising purposes.

2. Lighting Standards and Guidelines. Provide appropriate lighting levels in all areas used by pedestrians or automobiles, including building entries, walkways, parking areas, circulation areas, and other open space areas. Specifically:

a. All public areas shall be lighted with average minimum and maximum levels as follows:

i. Minimum (for low or nonpedestrian and vehicular traffic areas) of one-half foot-candle;

ii. Moderate (for moderate or high volume pedestrian areas) of one to two foot-candles; and

iii. Maximum (for high volume pedestrian areas and building entries) of four foot-candles;

b. Lighting shall be provided at consistent levels, with gradual transitions between maximum and minimum levels of lighting and between lit areas and unlit areas. Highly contrasting pools of light and dark areas shall be avoided;

c. Parking lot lighting fixtures shall be nonglare and mounted no more than twenty-five feet above the ground, with lower fixtures preferable so as to maintain a human scale. Requests for higher lighting fixtures may be considered with the approval of the director. All fixtures over fifteen feet in height shall be fitted with a full cut-off shield;

d. Pedestrian-scaled lighting (light fixtures no taller than fifteen feet) is encouraged in areas with high anticipated pedestrian activity. Lighting shall enable pedestrians to identify a face forty-five feet away in order to promote safety;

e. Lighting should not be permitted to trespass onto adjacent private parcels nor shall light source (luminaire) be visible at the property line. All building lights shall be directed onto the building itself and/or the ground immediately adjacent to it. The light emissions should not be visible above the roofline of the building. Light fixtures other than traditional cobra heads are encouraged; and


[IMAGE]


Figure 25. Lighting guidelines.

f. All outdoor lighting on public and private property shall comply with the dark sky provisions of Chapter 17.62. Exceptions may be allowed by the director for pedestrian-oriented lighting associated with commercial uses and/or mixed-use buildings.

H. Parking Lot Design.

1. Intent. To minimize potential negative impacts of parking lots on downtown’s visual character, pedestrian environment, local water quality conditions, and adjacent uses.

2. Surface Parking Lot Screening Standards.

a. Where new surface parking lots or parking lots associated with Level III additions are adjacent to streets, one of the following buffer options between the sidewalk and the parking lot shall be incorporated:

i. Provide a five-foot-wide planting bed that incorporates a continuous low wall (approximately three feet tall). The planting bed shall be in front of the wall and feature Type C landscaping. Alternative landscaping schemes will be considered by the director provided they meet the intent of the guidelines. The wall shall be constructed of brick, stone, decorative concrete or concrete block, or other permanent material that provides visual interest and helps to define the street edge as determined by the director. See Figure 26 for an example;


[IMAGE]


Figure 26. Parking lot planting buffer with low wall.

ii. Provide an elevated planter which is a minimum of five feet wide and between two and three feet in height. Ledges that are approximately twelve inches in width are encouraged as they can double as a seating area. The planter must be constructed of masonry, concrete or other permanent material that effectively contrasts with the color of the sidewalk and combines ground cover and annuals, perennials, ornamental grasses, low shrubs, and/or small trees that provide seasonal interest as determined by the director. See Figure 27 as an example; or


[IMAGE]


Figure 27. Elevated parking lot planting buffer.

iii. Provide at least ten feet of Type C landscaping.


[IMAGE]


Figure 28. Ten-foot parking lot buffer with Type C landscaping.

All options above should choose and maintain plantings to maintain eye level visibility between the street/sidewalk and parking area for safety. This means that shrubs and other low plantings should be maintained below three feet in height while trees (once they achieve taller heights) should generally be trimmed to up to the eight-foot level. See Figure 29.


[IMAGE]


Figure 29. Parking lot planting buffers shall emphasize the 3:8 rule for visibility and safety.

b. Where new surface parking lots or parking lots associated with Level III additions are located along side property lines, a six-foot screen fence shall be required on the property line with at least five feet of Type A, B, or C landscaping in front of the fence. Breaks in the fence/landscaping are permitted for internal pedestrian and vehicular connections between properties. Properties fronting on designated storefront streets and/or those with shared parking agreements with applicable neighbors are exempt from this requirement. Departures will be considered by the director provided they meet the intent of the standards (see Section 17.14.020(B)(2) for considerations).

3. Other Relevant Code Sections.

a. Section 9 (Parking Standards) of the City of Chelan Development Standards Manual.

b. Parking lot pathway standards set forth in Section 17.14.020(D)(4).

c. Internal parking lot landscaping standards set forth in Section 17.60.040(B)(3).

I. Special Features and Amenities.

1. Intent.

a. To create attractive and comfortable pedestrian environments.

b. To enhance the unique character and identity of downtown Chelan.

2. Durable Pedestrian Furniture. Pedestrian furniture provided in public spaces shall be made of durable, vandal- and weather-resistant materials that do not retain rainwater and can be reasonably maintained over an extended period of time.

3. Streetscape Amenities. Streetscape amenities must be integrated into the design of sidewalks in conjunction with new construction along all designated storefront and secondary streets. Level I and II additions and project sites adjacent to sidewalks that were recently constructed or upgraded by the city (as determined by the director) shall be exempt from these standards. For each one hundred cumulative lineal feet of storefront street frontage, at least two of the desired amenity elements listed below shall be included. Along designated secondary streets, at least one amenity element shall be included. The type, location, and design of chosen amenities shall contribute to a well-balanced mix of features on the street, as determined by the director. Desired amenities include:

a. Seating. Each six feet of seating area or four individual seats count as one amenity element. Seating areas should generally be located in areas that provide views of pedestrian activity. Seating ledges must be at least twelve inches wide to qualify;

b. Trash Receptacles. To qualify as an amenity, at least one trash receptacle is needed per one hundred linear feet of sidewalk. For designated pedestrian-oriented streets, this shall be required;

c. Permanent landscaping elements including planting beds and other landscaping elements that add visual interest to the sidewalk as determined by the director;

d. Special pavement patterns and/or tree grates;

e. Bicycle racks;

f. Informational kiosks (may count as two amenity elements at the discretion of the director);

g. Decorative clocks (may count as two amenity elements at the discretion of the director);

h. Artwork as approved by the arts council (may count as two amenity elements at the discretion of the arts council);

i. Special lighting; and

j. Other amenities that meet the intent as determined by the director.

Features above that are publicly funded, already required by code, and/or obstruct pedestrian movement shall not qualify as an amenity to meet this standard.

All features are subject to city approval.

(Ord. 1410 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2010).


17.14.040 Building design.

A. Purpose and Applicability.

1. Purpose. This section provides direction for the design of buildings consistent with the goals and policies of the Chelan downtown master plan.

2. Applicability. Unless otherwise noted, the provisions in this section apply to all nonresidential and multi-family development types within the downtown planning area.

B. Architectural Character.

1. Intent. To promote architectural design that reinforces and strengthens downtown Chelan’s unique small town/historic character/distinct setting. The focus is to encourage architecture with a strong sense of human scale, fine detailing, quality materials, sensitive to the environment, oriented to pedestrians, and designed appropriate to the site’s unique context. This approach is intended to allow for a diversity of architectural styles provided they meet the design standards of this chapter.

2. Architectural Character Standards and Guidelines.

a. Historic Core (Woodin Avenue between the River and Sanders Street).

i. Historic Buildings. Property owners of buildings constructed prior to 1950 are strongly encouraged to use the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (web: http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/) (hard copy also available at City Hall) as a guide to preserve, rehabilitate, restore, reconstruct, or add to historic properties. These standards provide detailed recommendations on restoration, maintenance, repair, replacement, design, alterations, building materials, roofs, interiors, etc. Also, the state of Washington’s website provides contacts and technical assistance related to historic preservation at: http://cted.wa.gov/site/411/default.aspx. Applicants are also encouraged to consult with the Historic Downtown Chelan Association and/or other local resources for design guidance involving planned remodels/additions to pre-1950s buildings.

Historic photographs are extremely useful in determining historic precedent. Contact the city or Chelan Historical Society regarding historical photographs of downtown Chelan.

Supplemental standards and guidelines:

(A) Covering over original windows or design details on identified historic buildings is prohibited.

(B) Alterations to historic materials should be minimized.

(C) Original architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced. If replacement is necessary, replacements should match the original in design, construction, color, and texture as close as possible.

(D) Missing architectural features should be replaced with an accurate duplication of the original features. However, a second acceptable option for the replacement feature is a new design that is compatible with the remaining character-defining features of the historic building. The new design should always take into account the size, scale, and material of the historic building itself and, most importantly, should be clearly differentiated so that a false historical appearance is not created. See Figures 32 and 33 for example facade enhancements/renovations.

(E) Unique features and examples of skilled craftsmanship should be maintained and protected.

(F) For facade additions to historic buildings, such additions should either extend the facade through use of consistent articulation, materials, and roofline treatment or design the addition to look like a separate building and comply with the guidelines for new buildings referenced in subsection (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section.

The director may allow alterations to the side or rear facades that are not character defining; provided, that the alterations do not interfere with existing building features or alter the historic character of the building. The director may allow alterations to the original primary facades in order to accommodate a desired use, provided deviation from historic conditions is minimized.


[IMAGE]


Figure 31. Illustrating how simple facade enhancements can upgrade the historic character of downtown.


[IMAGE]


Figure 32. Illustrating a desirable facade renovation to an existing Woodin Avenue building. Use of original facade materials is encouraged, if possible. Otherwise, use durable materials compatible with the facade and historic character of downtown.

ii. Nonperiod Architecture. Existing architecture which is not consistent with the early 1900 style and represents later periods is also encouraged to celebrate distinctive design features, except where such features conflict with other standards and guidelines herein, as determined by the director. Renovations of these structures should facilitate pedestrian access. Unique signage and design elements which are not inconsistent with the remainder of the guidelines are to be encouraged.

iii. New Buildings. Applicants for new buildings shall successfully demonstrate how they have based the building facade’s design on the form and elements common to early twentieth century downtown structures. This can be done through comparable facade massing and articulation, careful handling of the storefront and building top, and compatibility of materials and colors. Figure 34 below identifies desirable characteristics of existing buildings. Applicants may consider modern interpretations of these building elements and components in a way that meets the guidelines herein and complements the surrounding context.


[IMAGE]


Figure 33. Historic core design guidelines draw from desirable characteristics of existing buildings.


[IMAGE]


Figure 34. Appropriate and inappropriate infill building examples.

b. Other Sites within the DMU and TMU Districts.

i. Encourage architecture that emphasizes a human sense of scale, prominent rooflines, fine detailing, and an inviting appearance. The “Northwest” themed architectural style (popular in recent downtown construction – see Figure 35 below) emphasizing the use of natural wood (including heavy timbers), prominent rooflines, accent stonework, and detailed window trimming is encouraged.


[IMAGE]


Figure 35. Newer commercial buildings emphasize the use of wood and heavy timbers, prominent rooflines, and accent stonework.

ii. No franchise/corporate architecture. Architecture that is defined predominately by corporate identity features (and difficult to adapt to other uses) is prohibited. For example, some fast food franchises have very specific architectural features that reinforce their identity.

iii. Unusual design themes or architectural styles that have no history with Chelan are discouraged.

c. Sites within the DMR and DSF Districts. Encourage architectural styles that are compatible with the generally two-story and vernacular twentieth century architecture.

C. Architectural Scale.

1. Intent.

a. To reduce the scale of large buildings and add visual interest.

b. To enhance the visual character of downtown Chelan.

2. Building Articulation – Storefronts. All buildings adjacent to storefront streets or featuring a pedestrian-oriented facade built up to the sidewalk edge: Buildings must include articulation features no more than every forty feet to create a pattern of small storefronts. Buildings less than sixty feet wide are exempt from this standard. At least two of the following methods must be employed:

a. Use of window and/or entries that reinforce the pattern of forty-foot storefront spaces.

b. Use of weather protection features that reinforce forty-foot storefronts. For example, for a business that occupies one hundred twenty feet of frontage, use three separate awnings to break down the scale of the storefronts. Alternating colors of the awnings may be useful as well.

c. Change of roofline per subsection (C)(6) of this section.

d. Use of vertical piers that reinforce storefront pattern.

e. Change in building material or siding style.

f. Other methods that meet the intent of the standards as approved by the director.


[IMAGE]


Figure 36. Storefront articulation examples.

Departures will be considered by the city provided the design meets the intent of the standards. For example, the proposed articulation may be longer, but if the building features attractive detailing, materials, interesting roofline treatments, and interesting storefront design helps the design fit into the site’s context and contributes to the pedestrian environment and existing/desired character, then perhaps it should be an approved departure.

3. Building Articulation – Other Nonresidential/Mixed-Use Buildings. All other buildings featuring nonresidential uses on the ground floor (not covered in subsection (C)(2) of this section) shall include at least three of the following articulation features along all facades containing the public building entries (alley facades are exempt) at intervals of no more than sixty feet:

a. Providing vertical building modulation of at least two feet in depth and four feet in width if combined with a change in siding materials and/or roofline modulation per subsection (C)(6) of this section. Otherwise, the vertical modulation shall be at least ten feet deep and fifteen feet wide, to qualify.

b. Providing horizontal modulation (upper level step backs). To qualify for this measure, the minimum upper level step back shall be at least five feet and the treatment shall be used consistently with other articulation elements or utilized along at least seventy-five percent of the facade.

c. Repeating distinctive window patterns at intervals less than the articulation interval.

d. Providing a covered entry or separate weather protection feature for each articulation interval.

e. Use of vertical piers that reinforce storefront pattern. To qualify for this measure, the piers must project at least two inches from the facade and extend from the ground to the roofline.

f. Change of roofline per subsection (C)(6) of this section.

g. Changing materials and/or color with a change in building plane.

h. Providing lighting fixtures, trellis, tree, or other landscape feature within each interval.

i. Other methods that meet the intent of the standards as approved by the director.

Departures will be considered by the city provided the design meets the intent of the standards. Elements to consider are the level of detailing, quality of building materials, design of storefronts, and integration with, or enhancement of, the surrounding context.


[IMAGE]


Figure 37. Building articulation example for other nonstorefront commercial facades.

4. Building Articulation – Multi-Family Buildings. All multi-family buildings and residential portions of mixed-use buildings shall include at least three of the following articulation features at intervals of no more than thirty feet along all facades facing a street, common open space, and common parking areas:

a. Repeating distinctive window patterns at intervals less than the required interval.

b. Providing vertical building modulation. Minimum depth and width of modulation is eighteen inches and four feet (respectively) if tied to a change in color or building material and/or roofline modulation as defined in subsection (C)(6) of this section. Otherwise, minimum depth of modulation is ten feet and minimum width for each modulation is fifteen feet. Balconies may not be used to meet modulation option unless they are recessed or projected from the facade and integrated with the building’s architecture as determined by the director. For example, “cave” balconies or other balconies that appear to be “tacked on” to the facade will not qualify for this option.

c. Change of roofline per subsection (C)(6) of this section.

d. Providing horizontal modulation (upper level step backs). To qualify for this measure, the minimum upper level step back shall be at least five feet and the treatment shall be used consistently with other articulation elements or utilized along at least fifty percent of the facade.

e. Articulating of the building’s top, middle, and bottom. This includes a distinctive ground floor or lower floor design, consistent articulation of middle floors, and a distinctive roofline.

Departures will be considered by the city provided the design meets the intent of the standards. Elements to consider are the level of detailing, quality of building materials, types of articulated features, and integration with, or enhancement of, the surrounding context.

For articulation of townhouses, see Section 17.14.050(F)(5).

Figure 38. Building articulation example for other nonstorefront commercial facades.

5. Roofline/Cornice Design Options. Rooflines visible from a public street, open space, or public parking area must meet one of the following design options:

a. Comply with roofline modulation provisions per subsection (C)(6) of this section.

b. Provide a cornice of two parts with the top projecting at least six inches from the face of the building and the bottom part featuring a concave design or projecting at least two inches from the facade, but extending no less than two inches from the facade than the top part (see Figure 39 for examples). The height of the cornice (both parts combined) shall be at least twelve inches for buildings twenty feet or less in height; eighteen inches for buildings greater than twenty feet and less than thirty feet in height; and twenty-four inches for buildings thirty feet and greater in height. Cornices shall not project over property lines, except where permitted on property lines abutting public right-of-way. The cornice line must extend along at least seventy-five percent of the facade.

c. Other decorative cornice line that meets the intent of the standards. See Figures 39 and 40 for examples.

d. Any combination of the options above.

Figure 40. Desirable (left) and undesirable (right) local cornice examples.

6. Roofline Modulation. In order to qualify as a roofline modulation treatment in the standards herein, rooflines shall be varied by emphasizing dormers, chimneys, stepped roofs, gables, or a broken or articulated roofline consistent with the required articulation interval. Modulation shall consist of either:

a. For flat roofs or facades with horizontal eave, fascia, or parapet, the minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation is the greater of two feet or one-tenth multiplied by the wall height (finish grade to top of the wall) when combined with vertical building modulation techniques described in subsections (C)(2) through (4) of this section. Otherwise, the minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation is the greater of four feet or two-tenths multiplied by the wall height.

b. A sloped or gabled roofline segment of at least twenty feet in width and a minimum slope of 6:12. The roofline must include modulated segments at no more than the interval required per the applicable standard above.

c. A combination of the above.


[IMAGE]


Figure 41. Roofline modulation standards.

7. Maximum Facade Width. The maximum facade width (facades facing the street or customer parking lot) is one hundred feet. Exceptions: Buildings exceeding one hundred feet in width shall incorporate significant modulation and/or articulation features that effectively break up the scale of the building and add visual interest from the street. Such buildings shall incorporate at least one of the following design elements:

a. Provide vertical building modulation at least ten feet deep and twenty feet wide. For multi-story buildings the modulation must extend through more than one-half of the building floors;

b. Use of a contrasting vertical modulated design component featuring all of the following:

i. Component extends through all floors above the first floor fronting on the street. Exception: upper floors that are stepped back more than ten feet from the facade are exempt;

ii. Utilizes a change in building materials that effectively contrast from the rest of the facade;

iii. Component is modulated vertically from the rest of the facade by an average of six inches. The director may exempt storefront buildings from this provision provided all other standards herein are met and the design effectively meets the intent of the standards; and

iv. Component is designed to provide roofline modulation per subsection (C)(6) of this section; or

c. Facade employs building walls with contrasting articulation that make it appear like two distinct buildings. To qualify for this option, these contrasting facades must employ both of the following:

i. Different building materials and/or configuration of building materials; and

ii. Contrasting window design (sizes or configurations).

Departures will be considered by the city provided the design meets the intent of the standards. Elements to consider are the level of detailing, quality of building materials, types of articulated features, and integration with, or enhancement of, the surrounding context (considering views from all publicly observable locations within downtown).

Figure 42. Maximum facade width standards and acceptable/unacceptable departure examples. The upper right examples use a change in materials, facade articulation (window styles), and roofline change. The middle right image uses substantial facade and roofline modulation. The lower right does not include any notable articulation or modulation.

D. Building Elements and Details.

1. Intent. To encourage the incorporation of design details and small scale elements into building facades that are attractive at a pedestrian scale.

2. Facade Details Toolbox. All nonresidential and mixed-use buildings shall be enhanced with appropriate details. All new buildings must employ at least one detail element from each of the three categories below for each facade facing a street or public space for each facade articulation interval (per subsections (C)(2) and (3) of this section). For example, a building with one hundred twenty feet of street frontage with a facade articulated at forty-foot intervals will need to meet the standards for each of the three facade segments.

a. Window and/or Entry Treatment.

[IMAGE]


Figure 48. Acceptable and unacceptable metal siding examples. Notice the corner and window trim and use of concrete block near the ground level on the left image. The circled area on the right includes metal siding all the way to the ground, which is prohibited.

c. The use of metal siding is prohibited on designated storefront streets.

3. Concrete Block Standards. Concrete block may be used if it is incorporated with other permitted materials and it complies with the following:

a. When used for the primary facade, buildings must incorporate a combination of textures and/or colors to add visual interest. For example, combining split or rock-facade units with smooth blocks can create distinctive patterns; and

b. Concrete block may comprise no more than fifty percent of a facade facing a public right-of-way or open space. Departures to this standard will be considered by the city provided design treatments are included to enhance the visual character of the building at all observable scales.


[IMAGE]


Figure 49. Acceptable and unacceptable concrete block examples. The left example uses a mixture of split-faced colored concrete block and smooth-faced concrete block, together comprising just under fifty percent of the whole facade. The large expanse of smooth-faced concrete block on the right is not desirable for Chelan.

4. Standards for Stucco or Other Similar Troweled Finishes. Such material/finishes may be used if it is incorporated with other permitted materials and it complies with the following:

a. Stucco and similar troweled finishes (including exterior insulation and finish system or “EIFS”) must be trimmed in wood, masonry, or other material and must be sheltered from extreme weather by roof overhangs or other methods and are limited to no more than fifty percent of the facade area facing a public right-of-way or open space.

c. Chain link fencing (except for temporary fencing and for parks);

d. Fiberglass products and similar sheet products; and

e. Back-lit vinyl awnings used as signs.

6. Storefront Building Color. A storefront’s palette should be no more than three colors; one base color, one trim color, and one accent color. Encourage trim and accent colors that contrast with the base color. Specifically, darker base colors with white trim work particularly well. However, lighter base colors can effectively be combined with dark trim colors. Applicants should consult with the Historic Chelan Downtown Association on appropriate facade colors.

F. Blank Wall Treatment.

1. Intent.

a. To avoid untreated blank walls.

b. To retain and enhance the character and identity of downtown Chelan.

2. Blank Wall Definition. A wall (including building facades and retaining walls) is considered a blank wall if:

a. A ground floor wall or portion of a ground floor wall over six feet in height has a horizontal length greater than fifteen feet and does not include a transparent window or door; or

b. Any portion of a ground floor wall having a surface area of four hundred square feet or greater does not include a transparent window or door.


[IMAGE]


Figure 51. Blank wall definition and treatment examples.

3. Blank Wall Standards. Untreated blank walls visible from a public street or pedestrian pathway are prohibited. Methods to treat blank walls can include:

c. Installing a vertical trellis in front of the wall with climbing vines or plant materials;

d. Installing a mural reviewed by the arts council and approved by the director; and/or

e. Special building detailing that adds visual interest at a pedestrian scale. Such detailing must use a variety of surfaces; monotonous designs will not meet the intent of the standards.

For large visible blank walls, a variety of treatments may be required to meet the intent of the standards.

4. Fire walls along property lines are exempt from the above standards, but where they are visible to the public, they shall include horizontal and/or vertical banding or other design treatments to add visual interest to the wall.


[IMAGE]


Figure 52. Acceptable and unacceptable fire wall treatments. Note the use of horizontal banding in the left image. Plain concrete block as in the right image is not allowed.

G. Energy Efficient Building Design. The following are voluntary provisions intended to encourage energy efficient building design within Chelan.

1. Intent.

F. Townhouses.

1. Intent.

a. To ensure that townhouse developments enhance the pedestrian-oriented character of downtown streets.

b. To provide adequate open space for townhouse developments.

c. To reduce the impact of garages and driveways on the pedestrian environment.

d. To reduce the apparent bulk and scale of townhouse buildings compatible with the established character of downtown Chelan.

e. To promote architectural variety that adds visual interest to the neighborhood.


[IMAGE]


Figure 8. Desirable townhouse example. With units fronting on the street and garages placed to the rear accessible from an alley or shared driveway.

2. Entries.

a. Townhouses fronting on a street must all have individual ground-related entries accessible from the street. Configurations where enclosed rear yards back up to a street are prohibited;

b. Separate covered entries at least three feet deep are required for all dwelling units;

c. For sites without alleys or other rear vehicular access, new buildings must emphasize individual pedestrian entrances over private garages to the extent possible by using both of the following measures:

i. Enhance entries with a trellis, small porch, or other architectural features that provides cover for a person entering the unit and a transitional space between outside and inside the dwelling; and

ii. Provide a planted area in front of each pedestrian entry of at least twenty square feet in area, with no dimension less than four feet. Provide a combination of shrubs or ground cover and a street tree (refer to city arborist or street tree list if available); and

d. Planting strips with no dimension less than four feet are required adjacent to the primary entry of all dwelling units. This includes townhouses located to the rear of lots off an alley or private internal drive.

3. Garages and Driveways.

a. Where lots abut an alley, the garage or off-street parking area should take access from the alley;

b. For lots without alleys, individual driveways off of the street are prohibited (shared driveways are required);

c. Garages facing a public street are prohibited;

d. Internal Drive Aisle Standards.

i. Must meet minimum fire code widths;

ii. Minimum building separation along uncovered internal drive aisles shall be twenty-five feet. The purpose is to provide adequate vehicular turning radius, allow for landscaping elements on at least one side, and provide adequate light and air on both sides of the dwelling units and drive aisles, which often function as usable open space for residents; and

iii. Upper level building projections over drive aisles are limited to three feet, and must comply with provisions in subsection (F)(3)(d)(ii) of this section.


[IMAGE]


Figure 9. Good and bad examples of garage/entry configurations. The left example features a landscaped area and a trellis to highlight the entry. In the middle image, the balconies and landscaped areas deemphasize the garage. In the right image, the lack of landscaping is a glaring omission.

4. Open Space. Townhouse residential units shall provide open space at least equal to ten percent of the building living space, not counting automobile storage. The required open space may be provided by one or more of the following ways:

a. Usable private open space that is directly adjacent and accessible to dwelling units. Such space shall have minimum dimensions of at least twelve feet on all sides and is configured to accommodate human activity such as outdoor eating, gardening, toddler play, etc.;

b. Common open space meeting the requirements of Section 17.14.030(C)(5)(a);

c. Balconies, decks and/or front porches meeting the requirements of Section 17.14.030(C)(5)(b); and/or

d. Pea patch space meeting the requirements of Section 17.14.030(C)(5)(e).

5. Building Design.

a. Townhouse Articulation. Townhouse buildings shall comply with multi-family building articulation standards as set forth in Section 17.14.040(C)(4), except that the articulation intervals shall be no wider than the width of units in the building. Thus, if individual units are fifteen feet wide, the building shall include at least three articulation features per Section 17.14.040(C)(4) for all facades facing a street, common open space, and common parking areas at intervals no greater than fifteen feet.

b. Repetition with Variety. Townhouse developments shall employ one or more of the following “repetition with variety” guidelines:

i. Reversing the elevation of two out of four dwellings for townhouses;

ii. Providing different building elevations for external townhouse units (versus internal units) by changing the roofline, articulation, windows, and/or building modulation patterns (see Figure 10);

iii. Adding a different dwelling design or different scale of the same design, where a one-story version of the basic dwelling design where two stories are typical (or a two-story design where three stories are typical); and/or

iv. Other design treatments that add variety or provide special visual interest. While the variable use of color on buildings can be effective in reducing the perceived scale of the building and adding visual interest, color changes alone are not sufficient to meet the intent of the guidelines.

“Building articulation” means the giving of emphasis to architectural elements (like windows, balconies, entries, etc.) that create a complementary pattern or rhythm, dividing large buildings into smaller identifiable pieces. See Section 17.14.040(C) for applicable standards.

Common Open Space. See Section 17.14.030(C)(2)(b) for the definition of “common open space.”

“Condotel” refers to a building that is used both as a hotel and a condominium.

“Cottage housing” refers to clusters of small detached dwelling units arranged around a common open space.

“CPTED” refers to “crime prevention through environmental design,” which is a multi-disciplinary approach to deterring criminal behavior through environmental design. CPTED strategies rely upon the ability to influence offender decisions that precede criminal acts.

“Landscaped street” refers to a segment of a street envisioned to have or maintain landscaped building setbacks along the street. See Figure 2 for the location of designated landscaped streets and Section 17.14.020(D)(4) for the description and applicable standards for properties fronting on designated landscaped streets.

Multi-Family Open Space. See Section 17.14.030(C)(2)(d) for the definition of “multi-family open space.”

“Partial floor” refers to the space under a gabled or hipped roof where a horizontal line intersecting the roof decking and the exterior wall is no more than five feet above the floor level of the top floor.

Pedestrian-Oriented Open Space (or Pedestrian-Oriented Space). See Section 17.14.030(C)(2)(a) for the definition of “pedestrian-oriented open space” and Section 17.14.030(C)(3) for applicable design criteria.

“Roofline modulation” means variation in roof form. See Section 17.14.040(C)(6) for provisions.

“Secondary street” refers to a segment of a street in a mixed-use district where there is an option for storefronts or landscaped setbacks along the street and ground floor residential or commercial uses. See Figure 2 for the location of designated secondary streets and Section 17.14.020(D)(3) for the description and applicable standards for properties fronting on designated secondary streets.

“Solar access” means the availability of (or access to) unobstructed, direct sunlight.

“Solar reflectance index (SRI)” is a measure of the roof’s ability to reject solar heat, as shown by a small temperature rise. It is defined so that a standard black (reflectance 0.05, emittance 0.90) is 0 and a standard white (reflectance 0.80, emittance 0.90) is 100. For example, the standard black has a temperature rise of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) in full sun, and the standard white has a temperature rise of 14.6 degrees Fahrenheit (8.1 degrees Celsius). Once the maximum temperature rise of a given material has been computed, the SRI can be computed by interpolating between the values for white and black. Materials with the highest SRI values are the coolest choices for roofing. Due to the way SRI is defined, particularly hot materials can even take slightly negative values, and particularly cool materials can even exceed 100.

“Storefront street” refers to a street or segment of a street where envisioned to have storefronts placed up to the edge of the sidewalk. See Figure 2 for the location of designated storefront streets and Section 17.14.020(D)(2) for the description and applicable standards for properties fronting on designated storefront streets.

Usable Open Space. See Section 17.14.030(C)(2)(e) for the definition of “usable open space.”

“Transparent window” refers to a window that is capable of transmitting light so that objects or images can be seen as if there were no intervening material variation in roof form. (Ord. 1410 §§ 3, 10 (Exh. B) (part), 2010).

17.52.010 Purpose. 

The Planned Development District (“PDD”) is a separate zoning classification that is intended to allow new development which is consistent with the comprehensive plan but would not be permitted in other zoning districts due to limitations in the dimensional standards, permitted uses or accessory uses. More specifically, the purposes of this chapter are to: 

A. Permit flexibility in development design and/or combination of uses that will result in more efficient and desirable uses of land;

B. Encourage creativity in design to produce a development that would be better than possible under one of the other zoning classifications;

C. Facilitate development adaptations to meet anticipated market demands and/or better utilize sites with special features such as environmentally sensitive areas or unusual shape or size;

D. Increase the amount of open space, preserve scenic view corridors and protect natural areas including environmentally sensitive areas;

E. Produce innovative developments that implement the policies, spirit and intent of the comprehensive plan, shoreline management plan, zoning code, subdivision code, standards ordinance and other applicable city land use regulations. (Ord. 1533 § 6 (Exh. 51) (part), 2017: Ord. 983 § 1 (part), 1994).


17.52.020 Zoning district – Reversion. 

A PDD, approved in accordance with the procedures of this chapter, shall be considered a zoning district overlay and the uses within the PDD shall be limited to those which are specifically approved in that PDD development plan including recreational and open spaces, and shall be consistent with the base zone. PDDs may specifically permit all proposed uses and developments which can be shown to be in conformance with the policies of the comprehensive plan and the uses allowed in the base zone. PDDs are permitted at any location in the city subject to the provisions of this chapter. Approval of a PDD shall modify and supersede all regulations of the underlying zoning district. If an approved PDD ceases to exist for whatever reason, the area covered by such PDD shall revert back to its previous city zoning district classification without the PDD overlay; provided, that areas zoned PDD at the time of annexation into the city shall be zoned R-L Single-Family Residential and the uses within such area shall be limited to those uses then allowed in the original zoning district or the R-L Single-Family Residential zone as applicable. (Ord. 1533 § 6 (Exh. 52) (part), 2017: Ord. 983 § 1 (part), 1994).


17.52.030 Initiation of project – Application – Fee.

An application for the approval of a proposed PDD shall be made on forms provided by the city. A completed application must include all supporting documentation required pursuant to Section 17.52.060 and a nonrefundable filing fee together with a written commitment to pay all fees associated with the project as established by resolution of the city council. Application shall be made by the owner or owners of the parcel or parcels intended to be developed as a unit, or his or their duly authorized agent or agents. The ownership of all the parcels to be included must join in or be represented in the application. PDD projects may be initiated by any owner or group of owners of property acting jointly, or as a developer authorized to act as an agent for an owner or group of owners. The term “applicant” as used in this chapter shall mean and include all present and future owners of parcels included within the PDD. (Ord. 983 § 1 (part), 1994). 


17.52.040 Phased development. 

Development of the project may be phased, in which case each complete phase may be processed separately through both preliminary development plan review and final development plan review. A map showing all property owned or controlled by the applicant which is contiguous to the initial development site together with a description of said properties’ possible eventual development through all potential phases, shall be submitted with the application for the first phase. The described plan shall conform to the purposes of this chapter. The city’s comprehensive plan shall be used by the city in reviewing all phases of the development. (Ord. 983 § 1 (part), 1994).


17.52.050 Combined applications.



A. A preliminary PDD may be concurrently processed with a comprehensive plan future land use plan/zoning district map amendment.

B. Except where processed with as part of a comprehensive plan future land use plan/zoning district map amendment, a preliminary development plan and final development plan may be combined and processed together through the review process as a final development plan.

C. In addition, the applicant may file a concurrent subdivision or binding site plan application meeting the applicable requirements of Title 16 which shall be processed concurrently with the PDD application.

D. In case of conflict between the time limits set forth in this chapter and in other provisions of the Chelan Municipal Code or applicable state law, those provisions requiring public notice to be given the furthest in advance of the pending action shall prevail over conflicting provisions specifying that notice shall be given within a shorter time prior to the action. (Ord. 1533 § 6 (Exh. 53) (part), 2017: Ord. 1247 § 1, 2002; Ord. 983 § 1 (part), 1994).


17.52.060 Application – Supporting documentation.

An application for a PDD shall be accompanied by a project narrative and a conceptual master site plan that allows for analysis of overall project concepts and phasing as well as review of how the major project elements work together to implement city goals and policies. Master plan review allows for consideration and mitigation of cumulative impacts from large-scale development and allows for coordination with city capital improvement planning. Master plan review should occur at an early stage in the development of a project, when the scale, intensity and layout of a project are known. Specific application materials include the following:

Figure 5. Suspended sign examples.

g. Wall Signs. 

i. Size. The maximum area for the total of all permitted wall signs for any single wall plane shall not exceed ten percent. This shall include all window and door areas and shall be measured from the sidewalk or ground line to the building eave line or parapet.

ii. Location and Design. 

(A) Location. Wall signs shall be centrally located per the architectural features on the facade. Wall signs shall extend no wider than eighty percent of the width of the facade or storefront space. For example, most buildings are designed with specific areas of the building intended for signage – applicants shall utilize these areas for signage. Signs shall not cover over windows or other significant architectural features, as determined by the director. Where there is more than one tenant on the facade, signs should be centered above the storefront space, where architectural features allow. For multi-story buildings with upper level commercial tenants, signs may be located on applicable upper levels provided they meet applicable standards herein.

(B) Shape/Design. Applicants are encouraged to design and shape signs consistent with the architectural features of the facade. For example, rounded signs can look out of place in rectangular spaces unless they are centered or proportioned to fit the space. See Figures 6 and 7 for good and bad examples, respectively.

(C) For buildings built prior to 1950, applicants are encouraged to find historical photos (prior to 1950) to find appropriate examples of signage for the subject building. 

(D) Maximum Height. Wall signs may not extend above the building parapet, soffit, the eave line or the roof of the building. Except for signs identifying the name of the building, wall signs shall not be placed above the second floor of any buildings featuring more than two stories.

(E) Mounting. Wall signs must be mounted plumb with the building, with a maximum protrusion of one foot unless the sign incorporates sculptural elements or architectural devices. The sign frame must be concealed or integrated into the building’s architectural character in terms of form, color, and materials. 

(F) Lettering. The maximum height for lettering is three feet. The maximum height for logos is four feet. Greater heights for lettering and logos may be approved by the director when designed proportional to the building facade.

17.58.070 Murals – Standards. 

(Reserved)


17.58.080 Nonconforming signs – Provisions for amortization. 

A. Purpose. The ultimate purpose of any zoning or land use regulation is to confine certain classes of buildings to certain localities and to restrict other uses. The continued existence of those which are nonconforming are inconsistent with these goals, and therefore nonconforming buildings and uses should be reduced to conformity as completely and quickly as possible without causing substantial injustice. 

The city council recognizes that, absent specific regulations, nonconforming uses may tend to flourish. It is not the city’s intent that nonconforming signs continue in perpetuity. For this reason, the city has continued the amortization process which started with the adoption of a ten-year amortization period contained in Chelan Ordinance No. 789. 

The city council finds there are reasonably priced alternatives to the maintenance of nonconforming signs and the periods for amortization listed below will provide owners of existing nonconforming signs with a reasonable opportunity to obtain other alternative signs and a period to amortize the reasonable economic life and use of any existing nonconforming signs. 

B. Notice. The city will provide written notice of the expiration of the amortization period, as noted above, to the person responsible for said sign(s) at their last known address and provide notice to the owner of the property on which the sign is located. The city will utilize the tax assessor’s office to find the latest, updated address for the property owner. Said notice will be provided by mail, postmarked no later than thirty days prior to the cut-off date provided for in this section for request for consideration/extension (seven months prior to expiration of amortization period), unless extenuating circumstances as determined by the city require otherwise.

C. Request for Consideration/Extension. The city has established the time periods stated in subsection B of this section with the understanding that these time periods, along with the ten-year period established pursuant to Chelan Ordinance No. 789, provide a reasonable time period to recover the life expectancy of most signs. However, the city recognizes there may be special, unusual circumstances that may fall outside of those parameters.

1. Any person aggrieved by the imposition of the amortization clause may request a review of such application of the clause. The request for review shall be filed with the city not later than six months prior to the expiration of the amortization period. The review shall be heard by the board of adjustment pursuant to Chapter 2.15.

2. The aggrieved applicant has the burden of establishing the unreasonableness of the amortization period and must provide evidence showing the particular period is unreasonable.

3. The board of adjustment shall consider such things as lease obligations, life expectancy of the nonconformance, depreciation and the actual amount invested in the nonconforming sign. The board of adjustment shall also consider alternative uses available to the applicant to bring the design into compliance. The board of adjustment shall not consider replacement costs or fair market value in determining the value to the applicant.

4. The board of adjustment shall also consider the benefit to the public that is derived from the termination of the nonconformance, including: the concern for safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic; whether distracting signs may serve to break the concentration of those using the roads with the result of loss of life or property; or the location of the sign so as not to impair the safety of a moving vehicle by obscuring the driver’s vision. In addition, the board of adjustment is to consider the promotion of public safety, the promotion of aesthetic values and the interest of the general welfare.

5. The board of adjustment shall consider the preservation and improvement of the city’s physical environment, natural amenities and desirable characteristics of the city, as set forth in the city’s land use regulations. The board of adjustment may consider any combination of these legitimate public concerns; however, the board of adjustment may not rely solely upon the promotion of the aesthetic values to the city in supporting the amortization period.

6. The board of adjustment shall conduct a balancing of interest, considering the interest and hardship to the applicant, and whether the hardship to the applicant reasonably outweighs the benefit the public would derive from the termination of the nonconformance. If after careful consideration, the board of adjustment finds the amortization period as applied to the applicant’s nonconformance would result in a greater hardship to the applicant than benefit to the public, the board of adjustment may extend the amortization period to a point in time, where the balancing of interests would support the termination of the nonconformance. In no event shall this amortization period be greater than three additional years.

D. Loss of Nonconforming Status. A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its nonconforming designation if:

1. The sign is altered in any way or moved;

2. The business changes ownership;

3. The sign is replaced; or

4. Any new sign is erected or placed in connection with the enterprise using the nonconforming sign.

On the happening of any one of subsections (D)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, the sign shall no longer be designated a nonconforming sign and the administrator shall notify the sign user, sign owner or owner of the property upon which the sign is located of cancellation of the designation and the sign shall immediately be brought into compliance with this chapter and a new sign permit secured therefor, or shall be removed within ten days of notification. (Ord. 1417 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2011: Ord. 1022 § 13 (part), 1995).


17.58.090 Administration.

A. Permit Requirement. No sign governed by the provisions of this chapter shall be erected, altered or relocated from and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter without a permit issued by the city. 

B. Permit Applications. Application for a sign permit shall be made by the owner or tenant of the property on which the sign is to be located, or his authorized agent. Such application shall be made in writing on forms furnished by the city. Only fully completed applications shall be accepted. 

The application for a sign permit shall be accompanied by the following plans and other information: 

1. The name, address and telephone number of the owner or person entitled to possession of the sign and of the sign contractor or erector; 

2. The location by street address of the proposed sign structure; 

3. A drawing shall be submitted along with the sign permit application. This drawing shall be on paper capable of being folded for storage in an eight and one-half by eleven inch file, and shall become the property of the city. The drawing shall include the following: 

a. An accurate drawing, to a scale appropriate for showing all detail, of the sign including all mounting structures and devices, 

b. An accurately scaled drawing of all building faces to be signed, including the scaled outlines of all existing and proposed signs, in the case of wall and projecting signs, 

c. An accurately scaled site plan, showing the location of building(s), street(s), and sign(s) in the case of freestanding signs. 

C. Application Fees. An application fee shall be paid to the city and shall accompany an application for sign permit. The application fee shall be set by resolution of the city council. 

D. 1. Enforcement Authority. The sign code shall be administered and enforced by the city administrator or his/her designee. 

2. Administration. All signs in the city requiring a permit shall be reviewed by the administrator who shall consider the proposed general design, arrangement, size, lighting, placement and appropriateness of the proposed sign in relation to other signs and other structures on the premises and contiguous area in keeping with the intent of this chapter. The administrator shall approve or deny the permit. (Ord. 1417 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2011: Ord. 1022 § 13 (part), 1995).


17.58.100 Variances.

A. Any person may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from the requirements of this chapter. The sign variance shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in Chapter 17.64 as now exists or as may be hereafter amended. A fee will be charged based on processing costs as provided for city council resolution. In making any favorable decision on a variance application, the board of adjustment must adopt findings of fact and conclusions based on those findings shown to meet the criteria set forth in Chapter 17.64. 

B. Application for a variance on the same grounds shall not be heard within one year of the date of the board of adjustment’s decision. (Ord. 1417 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2011: Ord. 1022 § 13 (part), 1995).

Chapter 17.59 HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS

Sections:

17.59.010    Purpose and definition.

17.59.020    Guiding principles.

17.59.030    Applicability.

17.59.040    Submittal requirements.

17.59.050    Development and design standards.


17.59.010 Purpose and definition.

A. Purpose. The steep hillsides surrounding Lake Chelan are a defining natural feature and source of community identity for the city of Chelan. Views of the hillsides from public places are a community asset and preserving the hillsides is important for maintaining water quality in Lake Chelan. Due to limited land within the city, the hillsides also provide significant opportunities for new development including housing, tourist accommodations, agriculture, and agri-tourism uses. It is in the interest of the city and community to balance these competing interests and support community goals such as the preservation of public views, minimizing environmental impacts from new development, maintaining the community character of Chelan, providing affordable housing, and maintaining a strong year-round economy. The hillside development and design standards are intended to further these community goals and implement the comprehensive plan.

B. Definitions.

1. Minimize. Where the word “minimize” is used in this code, it means to reduce to the smallest possible amount, extent, size, or degree consistent with the intent of the guiding principles of this code.

2. Other Definitions. See Title 19. (Ord. 1533 § 8 (Exh. 92) (part), 2017).


17.59.020 Guiding principles.

The following guiding principles further define the intent and purpose of the hillside development and design standards and are not intended to be regulatory language:

A. Principle No. 1. Where feasible locate hillside development in areas that are not visible or have less visual impact from public places while preserving open space.

B. Principle No. 2. Design streets, sites, and buildings to integrate with the natural topography and minimize the need for regrading.

C. Principle No. 3. Hillside development should avoid impacting streams, ravines, wildlife habitats, ridgelines, and other natural features.

D. Principle No. 4. Design sites and buildings to minimize visual impacts from major public viewing areas. Consider use of techniques such as:

1. Clustering of buildings.

2. The use of vegetation to minimize the visual impact.

3. Building massing and modulation to minimize bulk and scale and the overall visual impact.

4. Use of facade materials that blend with natural environment.

E. Principle No. 5. Design sites and infrastructure to ensure public safety by minimizing impacts from erosion, dust, fires, floods, landslides, and other natural hazards both during and after construction.

F. Principle No. 6. Establish hillside development standards to maintain Chelan’s character, promote high-quality hillside development, and support implementation of the guiding principles.

G. Principle No. 7. Phase land disturbance to the maximum degree practicable. Focus grading in initial phases to construct the infrastructure for the project. Avoid mass grading, and defer clearing and grading of individual lots to the building permit stage. (Ord. 1533 § 8 (Exh. 92) (part), 2017).


17.59.030 Applicability.

The hillside development and design standards apply to any development application that involves slopes greater than twenty percent including subdivisions, site plan applications, conditional use permits, critical area permits, and building permits. These standards do not apply to permits and development agreements approved prior to the effective date of these standards. (Ord. 1533 § 8 (Exh. 92) (part), 2017).


17.59.040 Submittal requirements.

For all subdivisions involving erosion hazard areas or slopes above the threshold in Section 17.59.030, the following items shall be submitted for the pre-application review and are in addition to the requirements for a preliminary plat application identified in Section 16.04.090. In addition, the city may require third-party review from qualified professionals if necessary to determine compliance with the design and development standards. The applicant is required to pay all costs for third-party review. Modifications to site and building plans may be requested with a building permit application, but must be consistent with the approved subdivision.

A. A map identifying prominent natural features on the site and vicinity including vegetation and trees, streams, ravines, wildlife habitat, and others.

B. A map showing the conceptual street layout, typical street sections, grades, and access to developable properties.

C. A conceptual site plan showing the general layout of streets, parcels, buildings, driveways. The site plan and any supporting information shall show how natural features are protected and incorporated into the design of the subdivision.

D. Conceptual site plans for typical developable parcels including buildings, retaining walls, access, stormwater management, and landscaping.

E. Conceptual architectural renderings of typical buildings and sections from a licensed architect.

F. A summary of visual analysis for impacts on public views as designated in the city’s comprehensive plan.

G. A written statement describing design measures to minimize erosion, environmental and public view impacts.

H. Slope cross-sections that show the extent of proposed grading where the most grading is proposed, where there is the most intense development, where the site is most visible from public viewing areas, and along major streets.

I. Photographs of the property documenting existing conditions. (Ord. 1533 § 8 (Exh. 92) (part), 2017).


17.59.050 Development and design standards.

To comply with the development and design standards and address potential impacts, the project shall be designed to first avoid the impact. When avoiding the impact is not feasible or reasonable the project shall be designed to minimize the impact.

A. Subdivisions.

1. Streets.

a. The layout of parcels and streets shall be designed to minimize the overall length of streets.

b. Streets shall be located and designed to follow natural contours and minimize the need for regrading for both streets, parcel access, and buildings.

c. Subdivisions shall be designed to provide property access on both sides of the street wherever feasible to minimize the length and number of streets as well as the disruption to the hillside.

2. Clustering.

a. Clustering of parcels and buildings is strongly encouraged to minimize the disruption to steep slopes, to protect natural features, and minimize impacts on public views.

b. Residential cluster lot sizes shall be as specified in each zone. Where a cluster lot size is not specified in a residential zone, the administrator may reduce minimum lot sizes by up to fifteen percent to allow for clustering in order to minimize disruption to natural features and public views. Lot coverage shall be based on the minimum lots size in the district.

Exhibit 1. Clusters of buildings preserve open space and minimize visual impact.

3. Parcels/Building Lots.

a. Mass regrading of parcels to create flat building sites and buildings designed for flat sites is prohibited.

b. Parcels shall be located and configured to minimize the amount of grading needed for site development and access.

c. Buildings shall be oriented parallel to the slope to minimize cut and fill unless a proposed orientation has greater likelihood of meeting the code requirements. Retaining walls and rockeries must comply with Section 17.04.075 and shall only be permitted when necessary to support a structure and/or access road or driveway.

B. Building Location and Design.

1. Buildings shall incorporate the slope into the design of the building (see Exhibit 2). Buildings on steep slopes may step down slopes (see Exhibit 4) to break up the scale and mass of the building. Pier supported structures may be allowed where an applicant can demonstrate to the administrator’s satisfaction that it is unobtrusive within designated view corridors and that the design avoids fire hazards consistent with Chapter 15.06. See Exhibit 3.

2. Setbacks from the street shall be the minimum distance needed for parking and access (see Exhibit 3). The city may approve a reduction in the front yard setback to twenty feet to minimize grading and disruption to the hillside.

3. Where feasible without significant regrading, the design of low-profile buildings (see Exhibit 5) should be utilized to minimize the visual impact downslope and from public views as identified in the comprehensive plan.

4. Avoid use of retaining walls to minimize the visual impact downslope unless necessary for slope stability.

5. Buildings and retaining wall facades shall use natural materials that blend with the surrounding natural environment and hillside.

6. Minimize cut and fill to the amount necessary to support the building and access while protecting native vegetation.

Exhibit 2. Building design that incorporates the slope.

C. Landscaping and Vegetation.

1. The use of native vegetation and drought tolerant landscaping is required. Species shall be those listed on the Washington Native Plant Society list of native vegetation for Eastern Washington or an equivalent resource as approved by the city.

2. To the extent feasible, native vegetation shall be preserved in the design of the site and locations of buildings.

3. Vegetation that is disturbed during site development shall be replaced with native vegetation. (Ord. 1533 § 8 (Exh. 92) (part), 2017).

10. To ensure the long-term maintenance and attractiveness of landscape plantings.

B. Applicability. The standards herein apply to nonresidential and multi-family development unless otherwise noted herein. (Ord. 1410 § 4 (Exh. C) (part), 2010).


17.60.020 Plant materials standards. 

A. Native and Naturalized Plant Species. New landscaping materials shall include species native to eastern Washington or noninvasive naturalized species that have adapted to the climatic conditions of eastern Washington. The selection of plant species should include consideration of soil type and depth, the amount of maintenance required, spacing, exposure to sun and wind, the slope and contours of the site, compatibility with existing native vegetation preserved on the site, water conservation where needed, low flammability, and the impact of landscaping on visibility of the site for purposes of public safety and surveillance.

B. Tree Standards and Guidelines. Unless otherwise noted herein, required trees shall meet the following standards at time of planting:

1. Required trees within parking areas shall be a minimum caliper of two inches (as measured six feet above the root ball) and a minimum height of ten feet at the time of planting.

2. Required deciduous trees (other than street trees) shall be fully branched, have a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches (as measured six feet above the root ball), and a minimum height of eight feet at the time of planting.

3. Required evergreen trees (other than street trees) shall be fully branched and a minimum of six feet in height, measured from the treetop to the ground, at the time of planting.

4. If the director decides reducing the minimum size of trees will not detract from the desired effect of the trees, the minimum size of trees (other than street trees) may be reduced if the applicant submits a written statement by a licensed Washington landscape architect or Washington-certified professional horticulturist (CPH) certifying that the reduction in size at planting will not decrease the likelihood the trees will survive.

C. Shrub Standard. Shrubs, except for ornamental grasses, shall be a minimum of two-gallon size at the time of planting.

D. Ground Cover Standards and Guidelines.

1. Ground covers shall be planted and spaced to result in total coverage of the required landscape area within three years, or as per recommendations by a licensed Washington landscape architect or Washington-certified professional horticulturist (CPH) as follows:

a. Four-inch pots at eighteen inches on center.

b. One-gallon or greater sized containers at twenty-four inches on center.

c. A bed of flowers approved by the director in place of ground cover plants. A reduction in the minimum size may be permitted by the director if certified by a registered landscape architect that the reduction shall not diminish the intended effect or the likelihood the plants will survive.

2. Grass is acceptable as ground cover in landscaped areas, but generally not preferred for water conservation and maintenance purposes. (Lawn areas designed as play areas are an exception.)

3. Ground cover areas shall contain at least two inches of composted organic material at finished grade.

E. Soil Augmentation and Mulching.

1. Existing soils shall be augmented with a two-inch layer of fully composted organic material tilled a minimum of six inches deep prior to initial planting.

2. Landscape areas shall be covered with at least two inches of mulch to minimize evaporation. Mulch shall consist of materials such as yard waste, sawdust, and/or manure that is fully composted.

3. Berm/Mound Standards. Berms or mounds shall be no steeper than 3(H):1(V). Any slopes steeper than 3:1 (2:1 is maximum permitted by the city for fill slopes) need erosion control netting or other erosion control methods in planting areas not covered by grass (e.g., rockery).

4. Tree/Shrub Height and Location.

a. The landscape plan should plan for the mature size of trees and major shrubs to avoid interference with windows, decks or lighting.

b. Within the primary zone wildland-urban interface areas defined in Chapter 15.06, new development shall demonstrate the use of fire-resistive, and low-growing plants.

i. The first five feet from structure walls and attachment perimeters shall consist of a noncombustible surface (e.g., mineral soil, gravel, and paving stones).

ii. New development shall demonstrate planting plans ensure spacing between individual plants is dispersed and patchy as opposed to continuous to reduce the risk of horizontal fire spread.

iii. Trees shall be spaced, and plantings arranged, to meet requirements of Chapter 15.06, Wildland-Urban Interface Code.

F. Noxious Weeds. Planting plans shall exclude plants identified on the Washington State Noxious Weed List contained in Chapter 16-750 WAC. (Ord. 1533 § 6 (Exh. 72) (part), 2017: Ord. 1410 § 4 (Exh. C) (part), 2010).

17.62.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide regulations that preserve and enhance the view of the dark sky; promote health, safety, security, and productivity; and help protect natural resources. The provisions of this chapter are intended to control glare and light trespass. It is the intent of this chapter to provide standards for appropriate lighting practices and systems that will enable people to see essential detail in order that they may undertake their activities at night, facilitate safety and security of persons and property, and curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment. (Ord. 1352 § 7 Exh. 6 (part), 2008).


17.62.020 Definitions.

The following terms have the following definitions for purposes of this chapter:

A. “Accent lighting” means any luminaire that emphasizes a particular object or draws attention to a particular area for aesthetic purposes.

B. “Cut-off angle” (of a luminaire) means the angle, measured from the lowest point between a vertical line from the center of the lamp extended to the ground and the first line of sight at which the bare source is not visible.

C. “Fixture” (also called a “luminaire”) means a complete lighting unit including the lamps, together with the parts required to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.

D. “Foot-candle” means a measure of illuminance or a measure of how bright a light appears to the eye. One foot-candle is equal to one lumen per square foot. As an example, a typical sixty-watt incandescent lamp (eight hundred forty lumens) produces an illuminance of 0.1 foot-candles at a distance of about twenty-five feet.

E. “Lamp” means the light-producing source installed in the socket portion of a luminaire.

F. “Light pollution” means general sky glow caused by the scattering of artificial light in the atmosphere and resulting in decreased ability to see the natural night sky.

G. “Light trespass” means any light emitted by an outdoor luminaire that shines directly beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed, or indirectly shines beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed at a brightness (illuminance) that exceeds 0.1 foot-candles at the property line. This term includes light extending above a commercial building from a sky light.

H. Luminaire. See definition for “fixture” (subsection C of this section).

I. “Outdoor lighting fixture” means a luminaire outside of an enclosed building or structure or any luminaire directed such that it primarily illuminates outdoor areas.

J. “Shielding” means that no light rays are emitted by a fixture above the horizontal plane running through the lowest point of the fixture.

K. “Spotlight” means any lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction. (Ord. 1352 § 7 Exh. 6 (part), 2008).


17.62.030 Applicability.

A. All outdoor lighting fixtures installed on private and public property shall comply with this chapter. This chapter does not apply to interior lighting; provided, that if it is determined by the administrator that any interior lighting emitting light outside of the building or structure in which it is located creates a light trespass, the interior lighting shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.

3. Equipment shall be protected by wheel stops or concrete-filled bollards.

F. Notification. The following information shall be posted at all electric vehicle charging stations:

1. Voltage and amperage levels;

2. Hour of operations if time limits or tow-away provisions are to be enforced by the property owner;

3. Usage fees;

4. Safety information;

5. Contact information for reporting when the equipment is not operating or other problems. (Ord. 1425 § 3 (part), 2011).


17.63.050 Minimum parking requirements.

Electric vehicle charging stations located within parking lots or garages may be included in the calculation of the minimum required parking spaces required pursuant to the Development Standards, Section 9. (Ord. 1425 § 3 (part), 2011).

4. The term does not include any structure that, at the time the eligible facilities request application is filed with the city, does not support or house equipment described in subsections (1) and (2) of this definition.

“Collocation” means the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communication purposes.

“Eligible facilities request” means any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving:

1. Collocation of new transmission equipment;

2. Removal of transmission equipment; or

3. Replacement of transmission equipment.

“Eligible support structure” means any tower or base station as defined in this section; provided, that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the city.

“Existing” means a constructed tower or base station is existing if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process; provided, that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.

“Substantial change” means a modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the following criteria:

1. For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than ten percent or more than ten feet, whichever is greater;

2. For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet;

3. For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets; or, for towers in the public rights-of-way and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than ten percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure;

4. It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site;

5. It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure; or

6. It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified above.

“Tower” means any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul and the associated site.

“Transmission equipment” means equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC- licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

B. Application. Eligible facilities requests may be made by the applicant by submitting a written letter of request accompanied with a building permit application. The application shall be processed as a Type I permit (telecom permit). The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification.

C. Qualification as an Eligible Facilities Request. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request, the director shall review such application to determine whether the application qualifies as an eligible facilities request.

D. Time Frame for Review. Within sixty days of the date on which an applicant submits an eligible facilities request application, the director shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this section.

E. Tolling of the Time Frame for Review. The sixty-day review period begins to run when the application is filed and may be tolled only by mutual agreement by the director and the applicant or in cases where the director determines that the application is incomplete. The time frame for review of an eligible facilities request is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.

1. To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the director shall provide written notice to the applicant within thirty days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application.

2. The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the director’s notice of incompleteness.

3. Following a supplemental submission, the director will notify the applicant within ten days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notices delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this subsection. Second or subsequent notice of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.

F. Determination that Application Is Not an Eligible Facilities Request. If the director determines that the applicant’s request does not qualify as an eligible facilities request, the director shall deny the application.

G. Failure to Act. In the event the director fails to approve or deny a request for an eligible facilities request within the time frame for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the director in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. (Ord. 1561 § 4 (Exh. B) (part), 2019).


17.70.040 General siting criteria for towers.

A. The permitted land uses charts identify zoning districts and the review process for telecommunications facilities. The development standards in this section address setback and other site specific location factors. Siting criteria for towers and wireless communications facilities are necessary to encourage the siting of those facilities in locations most appropriate based on land use compatibility, neighborhood characteristics, and aesthetic considerations. No general siting criteria are necessary for satellite dishes or amateur radio towers because these facilities are allowed within all zoning districts.

B. Generally, collocation on existing towers is encouraged by fewer standards and less complex permit procedures (refer to permitted land uses charts). Further, attachment of antenna(s) to existing nonresidential structures and buildings primarily within industrial, manufacturing, business park, and commercial zoning districts is preferable to new towers or monopoles. Feasibility studies prepared by qualified radiofrequency engineers are required for applications for telecommunications facilities to demonstrate that locations on existing structures and/or higher ranked preferred siting locations have been explored by the permit applicant.

C. When a new tower is proposed, preferred locations are within the Warehouse and Industrial District (WI) zone by utilizing Type IIA (i.e., general development permit) permit procedures.

1. Towers including monopoles shall be minimized by collocating wireless facilities on existing towers. New towers are most appropriately located in the WI zoning district followed in order of preference by CW, CHS, TA, PLF, RM, and RL zoning districts. The site considered shall be a minimum of three hundred feet from residential structures unless locating at an existing wireless communications facility or Section 17.70.090, Special exceptions, criteria have been satisfied.

2. Wireless Communications Facilities. The following sites shall be considered by applicants as the preferred order for location of proposed wireless facilities including antenna(s), equipment, and equipment shelters. This section shall not apply to small wireless facilities. As determined feasible, and in order of preference, the sites are:

a. Existing Towers. On any existing site or tower where a legal wireless telecommunications facility is currently located regardless of underlying zoning.

b. Industrial, Manufacturing. Structures or sites used exclusively for industrial and manufacturing park uses within the Warehousing and Industrial District (WI) zone. These are areas of more intensive land uses where a full range of public facilities is expected.

c. Publicly Used Structures. Attached to existing public facilities such as water towers, utility structures, fire stations, bridges, and other public buildings within all zoning districts not utilized primarily for recreational uses. (Refer to rules and regulations specific to facilities located on city-owned land, buildings, or public rightsofway, Chapter 15.22.)

d. Business, Commercial and Public Facilities Sites. Structures or sites used for retail, commercial, and office uses. These are areas of more intensive land uses where a full range of public facilities is expected. These zones in order of priority are CW, CHS, TA and PLF.

e. Structures or sites which are not used wholly for residential use, including residential accessory structures (e.g., detached garage). Where the installation complies with all FCC regulations and standards, institutional structures, places of worship, and other nonresidential sites may be considered.

f. Residential Structures. Wireless communications facilities attached to residential structures are not permitted in the RL zoning district. (Ord. 1561 § 4 (Exh. B) (part), 2019).


17.70.050 Large satellite dish antenna(s) – Development standards.

A. Standards for All Zoning Districts. The following standards shall be applied to all proposed large satellite dish antenna(s):

1. Satellite dish antenna(s) reviewed under this section shall not be located within any front yard or side yard building setback areas.

2. Mountings and satellite dishes should be no taller than the minimum required for the purposes of obtaining an obstruction-free reception window.

3. To the extent technically feasible, specific paint colors may be required to allow the large satellite dish and mounting structures to blend better with their setting.

4. Screening of all large satellite dish antenna(s) shall be provided with one or a combination of the following methods: fencing, walls, landscaping, structures, or topography which will block the view of the antenna(s) as much as practicable from any street and from the yards and main floor living areas of residential properties within approximately five hundred feet. Screening may be located anywhere between the antenna(s) and the abovementioned viewpoints. Landscaping for the purposes of screening shall be maintained in healthy condition.

5. No satellite dish antenna(s) shall be used for the purposes of signage or message display of any kind.

6. Construction plans and final construction of the mounting bases of all large satellite dish antenna(s) shall be approved by the city building department.

7. Aluminum mesh dishes should be used whenever possible instead of a solid fiberglass type.

B. Additional Standards in Residential Zones – Large Satellite Dish Antenna(s).

1. Only one large dish satellite antenna shall be allowed on each property.

2. Large satellite dish antenna(s) shall not be mounted on roofs.

17.70.090 Special exceptions.3

When adherence to all development standards of this chapter would result in a physical barrier which would materially inhibit the ability to provide service, a special exception may be permitted, provided both criteria outlined below are met. Exceptions do not apply to variations from the International Building Code. A variance pursuant to Chapter 17.64 is required for variations from applicable zoning regulations not described in this chapter.

The final approval authority for granting of the special exception shall be the same as that of the permit approving the antenna(s) location. A request for a special exception shall be processed in conjunction with the permit approving the antenna(s) location and shall not require any additional application or fees.

Upon review of special exception requests, the approval authority shall consider first those standards having the least effect upon the resulting aesthetic compatibility of the antenna(s) or tower with the surrounding environment. The approval authority shall review setback, size, screening requirements, and height limits.

A. Special Exception Criteria – General Criteria.

1. The applicant shall justify the request for a special exception by demonstrating that the obstruction or inability to effectively provide service is the result of factors beyond the property owner’s or applicant’s control, taking into consideration potential permitted development on adjacent and neighboring lots with regard to future reception window obstruction. Pictures, drawings (to scale), maps and/or manufacturer’s specifications, and other technical information as necessary, should be provided to demonstrate to the city that the special exception is necessary.

2. The applicant for a special exception shall demonstrate that the proposed materials, shape, and color of the antenna(s) will minimize negative visual impacts on adjacent or nearby residential uses to the greatest extent possible. The use of certain materials, shapes and colors may be required in order to minimize visual impacts.

B. Large Satellite Dish Antenna(s) – Special Exceptions.

1. Residential Zones. Modifications to requirements for setbacks, size, screening and maximum height limit may be considered by special exception. If a special exception from the height limit for a groundmounted dish is requested, the height of the dish shall be limited to a maximum of eighteen feet.

Only if these modifications would still block an electromagnetic signal shall rooftop location be considered. If a special exception is sought to obtain a rooftop location, the diameter of the dish shall be limited to six feet and maximum permitted height shall be fifteen feet above the roofline. The approval authority may require the applicant to place the antenna(s) in an area on the roof which takes into consideration view blockage and aesthetics, provided there is a usable signal.

2. Nonresidential Zones.

a. GroundMounted Antenna(s). Exceptions to be first considered shall be from setback, landscape and service area requirements, and size and screening requirements. Only if these waived regulations would still block an electromagnetic signal shall a special exception from height requirements be considered. If a special exception is sought to vary from the height limit, the height of the dish shall be limited to a maximum of twenty feet.

b. RoofMounted Antenna(s). The first exception to be considered shall be the center of roof requirement; the second exception shall be from the size and screening requirements, respectively. Only if these waived regulations would still result in a block of the signal shall a special exception from height requirements be considered. A special exception from the height limit shall be allowed up to a maximum of twenty feet above the existing or proposed structure. The approval authority may require the applicant to place the antenna(s) in an area on the roof which takes into consideration view blockage and aesthetics, provided there is a usable signal and structural considerations allow the alternative placement.

C. Amateur Radio Towers – Special Exceptions.

1. Residential Zones. Where a property owner desires to vary from the height, location or setback limitations, the special exception general criteria must be met.

D.  Towers – Special Exceptions. Where a property owner desires to vary from applicable criteria, the special exception general criteria must be met.

E. Wireless Communications Facilities – Special Exceptions.

1. Special Use Zone and Residential Zones. An applicant of a proposed wireless facility that exceeds the height limit shall meet the special exception general criteria.

2. Commercial and Industrial Zones. An applicant of a proposed wireless communications facility that exceeds the height limit shall be required to meet the special exception general criteria. (Ord. 1561 § 4 (Exh. B) (part), 2019).


17.70.100 Design and concealment standards – Small wireless facility deployments.4

Small wireless facility deployments whether permitted in the right-of way under Chapter 15.22 or permitted in accordance with this chapter shall conform to the following design standards: 

A. General Requirements.

1. Ground-mounted equipment in the rights-of-way is prohibited, unless such facilities are placed underground, or the applicant can demonstrate that pole-mounted, or undergrounded equipment is technically infeasible. If ground-mounted equipment is necessary, then the applicant shall submit a concealment element plan. Generators located in the rights-of-way are prohibited.

2. No equipment shall be operated so as to produce noise in violation of Title 8.

3. Small wireless facilities are not permitted on traffic signal poles.

4. Replacement poles and new poles shall comply with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction and sidewalk clearance standards, and state and federal regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the rights-of-way. 

5. Replacement poles shall be located as near as possible to the existing pole with the requirement to remove the abandoned pole. 

6. The design criteria as applicable to small wireless facilities described herein shall be considered concealment elements and such small wireless facilities may only be expanded upon an eligible facilities request, when the modification does not defeat the concealment elements of the facility.

7. No signage, message or identification other than the manufacturer’s identification or identification required by governing law is allowed to be portrayed on any antenna, and any such signage on equipment enclosures shall be of the minimum amount possible to achieve the intended purpose; provided, that signs are permitted as concealment element techniques where appropriate.

8. Antennas and related equipment shall not be illuminated except for security reasons, as required by a federal or state authority, or unless approved as part of a concealment element plan.

9. Side arm mounts for antennas or equipment are prohibited.

10. The preferred location of a small wireless facility on a pole is the location with the least visible impact. 

11. When requested by the city, the applicant shall install a scaled mock-up version of the facility equipment for temporary viewing purposes to determine the least visual impact upon the city’s viewsheds and for visual encroachments that may undermine the historic downtown district character.

12. Antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary equipment, conduit and cable, shall not dominate the building or pole upon which they are attached.

13. The city may consider the cumulative visual effects of small wireless facilities mounted on poles within the rights-of-way when assessing proposed siting locations so as to not adversely affect the visual character of the city, important viewsheds of Lake Chelan, or detract from the historic character of the downtown district. This provision shall not be applied to limit the number of permits issued when no alternative sites are reasonably available nor to impose a technological requirement on the service provider.

14. When an applicant proposes siting small wireless facilities in the Downtown Planning Area, as described in Section 17.14.020, small wireless facilities permit applications should include a nonbinding recommendation from the HDCA regarding concealment and camouflaged techniques to ensure consideration of preserving the historical intent of the district is upheld. This is recommended as HDCA will be consulted as part of the application review process.

15. The concealment element plan shall include the design of the screening, fencing or other concealment technology for a tower, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the proposed small wireless communications facility, including but not limited to fiber and power connections. 

a. The concealment element design should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of wireless communications facility installations. The proposed pole or structure should have similar designs to existing neighboring poles in the rights-of-way, including to the extent technically feasible, similar height. Other concealment methods include, but are not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color and texture – or the appearance thereof – as the surface against which the installation will be seen or on which it will be installed, landscape design, or other camouflage strategies appropriate for the type of installation. Applicants are required to utilize designs in which all conduit and wirelines are installed internally in the structure or otherwise integrated into the design of the structure. Use of a unified enclosure equal to or less than four cubic feet in volume may be permitted in meeting these criteria.

b. If the director has already approved a concealment element design in a franchise agreement, or another wireless communications facility along the same public right-of-way for the same pole type, then the applicant shall utilize a substantially similar concealment element design, unless it can show that such concealment element design is not physically or technologically feasible, or that such deployment would undermine the generally applicable design standards. 

B. These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape.

C. Small Wireless Facilities Attached to Non-Wooden Poles. Small wireless facilities attached to existing or replacement non-wooden light poles and other non-wooden poles in the right-of-way or poles outside of the right-of-way shall conform to the following design criteria:

1. Antennas and the associated equipment enclosures shall be sited and installed in a manner which minimizes the visual impact on the streetscape either by fully concealing the antennas and associated equipment fully within the pole or through a concealment element plan which provides an equivalent or greater impact reduction. This requirement shall be applied in a manner which does not dictate the technology employed by the service provider nor unreasonably impair the technological performance of the equipment chosen by the service provider.

2. All conduit, cables, wires and fiber must be routed internally in the light pole. Full concealment of all conduit, cables, wires and fiber is required within mounting brackets, shrouds, canisters or sleeves if attaching to exterior antennas or equipment.

3. An antenna on top of an existing pole may not extend more than ten percent above the height of surrounding structures nor shall exceed six feet above the height of the existing pole, whichever is less, unless the provider can provide evidence that the deployment is technically unfeasible at this height allowance. The carrier must deploy the lowest height extension that is technically feasible.

4. The diameter may not exceed sixteen inches, measured at the top of the pole. The antennas shall be integrated into the pole design so that they appear as a continuation of the original pole, including colored or painted materials to match the pole, and shall be shrouded or screened to blend with the pole; canister antennas shall be required to match color, texture, and/or material of support structure and be designed in a way as to appear as an extension of the pole. All cabling and mounting hardware/brackets from the bottom of the antenna to the top of the pole shall be fully concealed and integrated with the pole.

5. Any replacement pole shall substantially conform to the design of the pole it is replacing or the neighboring pole design standards utilized within the contiguous right-of-way. In the Downtown Planning Area, applications for new poles should be reviewed and accompanied by a nonbinding letter of recommendation by the HDCA as HDCA will be consulted as part of the application review process.

6. The height of any replacement pole may not extend more than ten feet above the height of the existing pole or the minimum additional height necessary for adequate clearance from electrical wires, whichever is greater. 

7. The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the city’s setback and sidewalk clearance requirements, ADA requirements, and if a replacement light standard then with the city’s lighting requirements. 

8. The use of the pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

D. Wooden Pole Design Standards. Small wireless facilities located on wooden poles shall conform to the following design criteria:

1. The wooden pole at the proposed location may be replaced with a taller pole for the purpose of accommodating a small wireless facility; provided, that the replacement pole shall not exceed a height that is a maximum of six feet taller than the existing pole, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height extension is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities. 

2. A pole extender may be used instead of replacing an existing pole but may not increase the height of the existing pole by more than ten feet, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height increase is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities. A “pole extender” as used herein is an object affixed between the pole and the antenna for the purpose of increasing the height of the antenna above the pole. The pole extender shall be painted to approximately match the color of the pole and shall substantially match the diameter of the pole measured at the top of the pole.

3. Replacement wooden poles may either match the approximate color and materials of the replaced pole or shall be the standard new wooden pole used by the pole owner in the city.

4. Antennas, equipment enclosures, and all ancillary equipment, boxes and conduit shall be colored or painted to match the approximate color of the surface of the wooden pole on which they are attached.

5. Panel antennas shall not be mounted more than twelve inches from the surface of the wooden pole.

6. Antennas should be placed in an effort to minimize visual clutter and obtrusiveness. Multiple antennas are permitted on a wooden pole; provided, that each antenna enclosure shall not be more than three cubic feet in volume.

7. A canister antenna may be mounted on top of an existing wooden pole, which may not exceed the height requirements described in subsection (D)(1) of this section. A canister antenna mounted on the top of a wooden pole shall not exceed sixteen inches, measured at the top of the pole, and shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The canister antenna must be placed to look as if it is an extension of the pole. In the alternative, the applicant may propose a side-mounted canister antenna, so long as the inside edge of the antenna is no more than twelve inches from the surface of the wooden pole. All cables shall be concealed either within the canister antenna or within a sleeve between the antenna and the wooden pole.

8. An omni-directional antenna may be mounted on the top of an existing wooden pole, provided such antenna is no more than four feet in height and is mounted directly on the top of a pole or attached to a sleeve made to look like the exterior of the pole as close to the top of the pole as technically feasible. All cables shall be concealed within the sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket. 

9. All related equipment, including but not limited to ancillary equipment, radios, cables, associated shrouding, microwaves, and conduit which are mounted on wooden poles, shall not be mounted more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is technically required, and is confirmed in writing by the pole owner. 

10. Equipment for small wireless facilities must be attached to the wooden pole, unless otherwise permitted to be ground-mounted pursuant to subsection (A)(1) of this section. The equipment must be placed in the smallest enclosure possible for the intended purpose. The equipment enclosure may not exceed twenty-eight cubic feet. Multiple equipment enclosures may be acceptable if designed to more closely integrate with the pole design and do not cumulatively exceed twenty-eight cubic feet. The applicant is encouraged to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole, if such banners or road signs are allowed by the pole owner.

11. An applicant who desires to enclose its antennas and equipment within a unified enclosure may do so; provided, that such unified enclosure does not exceed four cubic feet. To the extent possible the unified enclosure shall be placed so as to appear as an integrated part of the pole or behind banners or signs. The unified enclosure may not be placed more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is technically required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner.

12. The visual effect of the small wireless facility on all other aspects of the appearance of the wooden pole shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible.

13. The use of the wooden pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

14. All cables and wires shall be routed through conduit along the outside of the pole. The outside conduit shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The number of conduits shall be minimized to the number technically necessary to accommodate the small wireless facility.

E. Small Wireless Facilities Attached to Existing Buildings. Small wireless facilities attached to existing buildings shall conform to the following design criteria:

1. Small wireless facilities may be mounted to the sides of a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building’s architectural theme.

2. Small wireless facilities may not extend more than ten percent of the building height and may not be more than ten percent of the allowed building height in any zone.

3. Small wireless facilities shall not interrupt existing and prominent architectural lines or horizontal features and details or vertical reveals.

4. New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if they complement the architecture of the existing building.

5. Small wireless facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building.

6. Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed cabling/wiring is prohibited.

7. Small wireless facilities shall be painted and textured to match the adjacent building surfaces.

F. Small wireless facilities mounted on cables strung between existing utility poles shall conform to the following standards:

1. Each strand-mounted facility shall be no more than three cubic feet in volume;

2. Only one strand-mounted facility is permitted per cable between any two existing poles; 

3. The strand-mounted devices shall be placed as close as possible to the nearest utility pole, in no event more than five feet from the pole unless a greater distance is required by the pole owner for safety clearance; 

4. No strand-mounted device shall be located in or above the portion of the roadway open to vehicular traffic; 

5. Grantee may not place an ancillary pole or ground-mounted equipment to accommodate such strand-mounted facilities, unless in the case of ground-mounted equipment placed in preexisting equipment cabinets; and

6. Such strand-mounted devices must be installed to cause the least visual impact and without excess exterior cabling or wires (other than the original strand).

G. New Poles in the Rights-of-Way for Small Wireless Facilities and Installations. An application for a new pole in the right-of-way is subject to a special development permit and any conditions set forth in the governing franchise agreement consistent with Chapter 15.22.

1.  New poles within the rights-of-way are only permitted if the applicant can establish that:

a. The proposed small wireless facility cannot be located on an existing utility pole or light pole, electrical transmission tower or on a site outside of the public rights-of-way such as a public park, public property, building, transmission tower or in or on a nonresidential use in a residential zone whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure; 

b. The proposed wireless communications facility receives approval for a concealment element plan, as described in subsection (H)(3) of this section;

c. The proposed wireless communications facility also complies with shoreline and SEPA, if applicable.

2. Even if an alternative location is established pursuant to subsection (G)(1) of this section, the hearing examiner may determine through the special development permit process that a new pole in the right-of-way is in fact a superior alternative based on the impact to the city, the particulars of the concealment element design, goals of the city’s comprehensive plan, and the added benefits to the community.

3. Prior to the issuance of a permit to construct a new pole or ground-mounted equipment in the right-of-way, the applicant must obtain a site-specific agreement from the city to locate such new pole or ground-mounted equipment. This requirement also applies to replacement poles that are higher than the replaced pole, and the overall height of the replacement pole and the proposed wireless communications facility is more than sixty feet.

4. Installation of small wireless facilities in a design district shall be permitted by an administrative approval of a concealment plan utilizing the design and concealment standards contained in this chapter.

5. These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting.

D. Incomplete Application Procedure.

1. If the applicant is issued a written determination from the city that an application is not complete, the applicant shall have ninety calendar days from date of personal delivery or date of mailing by the city to submit the required information to the city.

1. Any period during which the applicant has been requested by the city to correct plans, perform required studies, or provide additional required information. The period shall be calculated from the date the city notifies the applicant of the need for additional information until the earlier of the date the city determines whether the additional information satisfies the request for information or fourteen days after the date the information has been provided to the city;

2. If the city determines that the information submitted by the applicant under subsection (A)(1) of this section is insufficient, it shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies and the procedures under subsection (A)(1) of this section shall apply as if a new request for studies had been made;

3. Any period during which an environmental impact statement is being prepared following a determination of significance pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW, if the city by ordinance has established time periods for completion of environmental impact statements, or if the city and the applicant in writing agree to a time period for completion of an environmental impact statement;

For the purposes of this section, a vested application shall mean that the applicant is entitled to implement the development proposal described in the application under the zoning, development and land use ordinances applied by the city in its review of the application without being subject to changes in development regulations subsequent to the submittal date except to the extent allowed by the city’s police power to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

B. Subsequent Regulations. An applicant may have the option of subjecting its development to any subsequently enacted land use ordinances. However, should an applicant choose to subject its development to a subsequently enacted land use ordinance, this shall have the effect of subjecting the development to all land use ordinances enacted after the application is vested, unless the city and applicant agree otherwise. In order for the planning official to grant such a request, the applicant must demonstrate how later enacted ordinance(s) will benefit both the project and the city while maintaining consistency with the comprehensive plan. The applicant must also demonstrate that use of later enacted ordinances will not conflict with other ordinances to which the development remains subject and will not be significantly detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the city.

C. Exception to Vesting. Unless expressly authorized elsewhere in this title, vested rights shall apply only to development regulations and shall not be applied to permit processing fees, development review fees, other lawful fees, and regulations that affect the procedure through which a project permit application is processed or reviewed. (Ord. 1491 § 8 (Exh. J), 2015).

Chapter 19.26 CONSISTENCY WITH DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS AND SEPA

Sections:

19.26.010    Determination of consistency.

19.26.020    Initial SEPA analysis.

19.26.030    Categorically exempt and planned actions.


19.26.010 Determination of consistency.

A. Purpose. When the city receives a project permit application, consistency between the proposed project and the applicable regulations and comprehensive plan shall be determined through the process in this chapter.

B. Consistency. During project permit application review, the city shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project. In the absence of applicable development regulations, the city shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the city’s adopted comprehensive plan. This determination of consistency shall include the following:

1. The type of land use permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances, such as but not limited to planned unit developments and conditional and special uses, if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied;

2. The level of development, such as units per acre, density of residential development in urban growth areas or other measures of density;

3. Availability and adequacy of infrastructure and public facilities identified in the comprehensive plan, if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities as required by Chapter 36.70A RCW; and

4. Character of the development, such as but not limited to development standards. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.04.010).


19.26.020 Initial SEPA analysis.

A. The city shall also review the project permit application under the requirements of SEPA and Chapter 14.06, and shall:

1. Determine whether the applicable regulations require studies that adequately analyze all of the project permit application’s specific probable adverse environmental impacts (see subsection D of this section for how determination is made);

2. Determine if the applicable regulations require measures that adequately address such environmental impacts;

3. Determine whether additional studies are required and/or whether the project permit application should be conditioned with additional mitigation measures;

4. Provide for prompt and coordinated review by government agencies and the public on compliance with applicable environmental laws and plans, including mitigation for specific project impacts that have not been considered and addressed at the plan or development regulation level.

B. In its review of a project permit application, the city may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection and mitigation measures in the applicable development regulations, comprehensive plan and/or in other applicable local, state or federal laws provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the application.

C. If the city’s comprehensive plans, subarea plans and development regulations adequately address a project’s specific adverse environmental impacts, as determined under subsections A and B of this section, it shall not impose additional mitigation under SEPA during project review.

D. A comprehensive plan, subarea plan, development regulation or other applicable local, state or federal law permits adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of an application when:

1. The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; or

2. The city has designated as acceptable certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards or other land use planning required or allowed by Chapter 36.70A RCW.

E. In its decision whether a specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or law of another agency with jurisdiction and with environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the city shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. Any oral consultation shall be documented in the project permit file. In making this deferral, the city shall base or condition its project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws.

F. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city in its review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analyses and requirements under other laws, as provided by Chapter 43.21C RCW. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.04.020).


19.26.030 Categorically exempt and planned actions.

A. Categorically Exempt. Actions categorically exempt under RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a) do not require environmental review or the preparation of an environmental impact statement. An action that is categorically exempt under the rules adopted by the Department of Ecology (Chapter 197-11 WAC) may not be conditioned or denied under SEPA.

B. Planned Actions.

1. A planned action does not require a threshold determination or the preparation of an environmental impact statement under SEPA, but is subject to environmental review and mitigation under SEPA.

2. A “planned action” means one or more types of project action that:

a. Are designated planned actions by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the city;

b. Have had the significant impacts adequately addressed in an environmental impact statement prepared in conjunction with:

i. A comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW; or

ii. A fully contained community, a master planned resort, a master planned development or a phased project;

c. Are subsequent or implementing projects for the proposals listed in subsection (B)(2)(b) of this section;

d. Are located within an urban growth area, as defined in RCW 36.70A.030;

e. Are not essential public facilities, as defined in RCW 36.70A.200; and

f. Are consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW.

C. Limitations on Planned Actions. The city shall limit planned actions to certain types of development or to specific geographical areas that are less extensive than the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, and may limit a planned action to a time period identified in the environmental impact statement or in the ordinance or resolution designating the planned action under RCW 36.70A.040.

D. Limitations on SEPA Review. During project reviews, the city shall not reexamine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in Section 19.26.010(B), except for issues of code interpretation. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as, but not limited to, the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a proposal’s probable adverse environmental impacts. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.04.030).

B. Give notice;

C. Prepare the staff report on the application, which shall be a single report stating all of the decisions made as of the date of the report, including recommendations on project permits in the consolidated permit process that do not require an open record predecision hearing. The report shall state any mitigation required or proposed under the development regulations or the city’s authority under SEPA. If the threshold determination other than a determination of significance has not been issued previously by the city, the report shall include or append this determination. In the case of a Type I or II project permit application, this report may be the permit;

D. Prepare the notice of decision, if required by the hearing body, and/or mail a copy of the notice of decision to those required by this code to receive such decision. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.05.020).


19.30.030 Joint public hearings.

A. Administrator’s Decision to Hold Joint Hearing. The administrator may combine any public hearing on a project permit application with any hearing that may be held by another local, state, regional, federal, or other agency on the proposed action, as long as: (1) the hearing is held within the city limits; and (2) the requirements of subsection C of this section are met.

B. Applicant’s Request for a Joint Hearing. The applicant may request that the public hearing on a permit application(s) be combined as long as the joint hearing can be held within the time periods set forth in this title. In the alternative, the applicant may agree to a particular schedule if that additional time is needed in order to combine the hearings.

C. Prerequisites to Joint Public Hearing. A joint public hearing may be held with another local, state, regional, federal or other agency and the city, as long as:

1. The other agency is not expressly prohibited by statute from doing so;

2. Sufficient notice of the hearing is given to meet each of the agencies’ adopted notice requirements as set forth in statute, ordinance, or rule;

3. The agency has received the necessary information about the proposed project from the applicant in enough time to hold its hearing at the same time as the local government hearing; and

4. The hearing is held within the geographic boundaries of Chelan or Douglas Counties. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010).


19.30.040 Conflict of interest.

The hearing examiner shall be subject to the code of ethics and prohibitions on conflict of interest as set forth in RCW 35A.42.020 and Chapter 42.23 RCW, as the same now exist or as may be hereafter amended. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.05.030).


19.30.050 Appearance of fairness.

A. Open public hearings by the hearing examiner shall be subject to Chapter 42.36 RCW, as the same now exists or as may be hereafter amended.

B. The hearing examiner will not be disqualified by the appearance of fairness doctrine for conducting the business of his or her office with any constituent on any matter other than a matter subject to an open public hearing pending before the hearing examiner.

C. Anyone seeking to rely on the appearance of fairness doctrine to disqualify the hearing examiner from conducting an open record hearing must raise the challenge as soon as the basis for disqualification is made known to the individual. Where the basis is known or should reasonably have been known prior to the issuance of a decision and is not raised, it may not be relied on to invalidate the decision. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010).


19.30.060 Ex parte communications.

During the pendency of any quasi-judicial proceeding, the hearing examiner shall not engage in ex parte communications with opponents or proponents of the project permit application, unless the hearing examiner:

A. Places on the record the substance of any written or oral ex parte communications concerning the decision or action; and

B. Provides that a public announcement of the content of the communication and of the parties’ rights to rebut the substance of the communication shall be made at each hearing where action is considered or taken on the subject to which the communication related. This prohibition does not preclude the hearing examiner from seeking in a public hearing specific information or date from such parties relative to the decision if both the request and the results are a part of the record. Nor does such prohibition preclude correspondence between a citizen and the hearing examiner if any such correspondence is made a part of the record when it pertains to the subject matter of a quasi-judicial proceeding. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.05.040).


19.30.070 Burden and nature of proof.

The applicant has the burden of proving the project complies with the development regulations and is consistent with SEPA. The project permit application must be supported by proof that it conforms to the applicable elements of the city’s development regulations, comprehensive plan and that any significant adverse environmental impacts have been adequately addressed. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.05.050).


19.30.080 Order of proceedings.

A. Before receiving information on the issue, the following shall be determined:

1. Any objections on jurisdictional grounds shall be noted on the record and, if there is objection, the hearing body has the discretion to proceed or terminate;

2. Any abstentions or disqualifications shall be determined.

B. The hearing examiner may take official notice of known information related to the issue, such as:

1. A provision of any ordinance, resolution, rule, officially adopted development standard or state law;

2. Other public records and facts judicially noticeable by law.

C. Matters officially noticed need not be established by evidence and may be considered by the hearing examiner in arriving at their decision. Parties requesting notice shall do so on the record. However, the hearing examiner may take notice of matters listed in subsection B of this section if stated for the record. Any matter given official notice may be rebutted.

D. The hearing examiner may view the area in dispute with or without notification to the parties, but shall place the time, manner and circumstances of such view on the record.

E. Information shall be received from the staff and from proponents and opponents. The hearing examiner may approve or deny a request from a person attending the hearing to ask a question. Unless the hearing examiner specifies otherwise, if the request to ask a question is approved, the hearing examiner will direct the question to the person submitting testimony. (Ord. 1411 § 5 (Exh. E) (part), 2010: Ord. 1037 § 1 (part), 1996. Formerly 19.05.060).

1. Predevelopment versus post development need for services such as city streets, sewers, water supplies, drainage, facilities, parks, playgrounds, recreational facilities, schools, police services, fire services, and other municipal facilities and services. Need shall be measured not only from increased demand created by the development itself, but any reduction in the municipal facilities or services brought about as a direct result of the development;

2. Likelihood that a direct impact of a proposed development would require mitigation due to the cumulative effect of such impact when aggregated with the similar impacts of future development in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development;

3. Size, number, condition and proximity of existing facilities to be affected by the proposed development;

4. Nature and quantity of capital improvements reasonably necessary to mitigate specific direct impacts identified as a consequence of the proposed development;

5. Likelihood that the users of the proposed development will benefit from any mitigating capital improvements or programs; and

6. Any significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed development identified in the process of complying with the environmental policy ordinance or the State Environmental Policy Act.

C. Costs. The cost of any investigation, analysis or reports necessary for a determination of direct impact shall be borne by the applicant.

D. Mitigation of Direct Impacts. The official or body charged with granting the necessary approval for a proposed development shall review an applicant’s proposal for mitigation, any identified direct impacts and determine whether such proposal is a reasonable and acceptable mitigation measure considering the cost and land requirements of the required improvement and the extent to which the necessity for the improvement is attributable to the direct impacts of the proposed development. No official or body shall approve a development unless reasonable provisions have been made to mitigate identified direct impacts that are direct consequences of such development.

E. Methods of Mitigation.

1. The methods of mitigating identified direct impacts required as a condition of any development approval may include, but are not limited to, dedication of land to any public body, off-site improvement, on-site improvements, and other capital or noncapital methods that may effectively reduce direct impacts.

2. In lieu of a dedication of land or to mitigate a direct impact that has been identified as a consequence of a proposed development, the city may approve a voluntary payment agreement with the developer, and shall be subject to the following provisions:

a. The official or body approving development must find that the money offered will mitigate or is a satisfactory alternative to mitigate the identified direct impact.

b. The payment shall be held in a reserve account and may only be expended to fund a capital improvement or program agreed upon by the parties to mitigate the identified direct impact.

c. The payment shall be expended in all cases within ten years of collection, unless otherwise agreed to by the developer.

d. Any payment not expended within ten years of collection shall be refunded to the property owners of record at the time of the refund with interest at the rate earned in the city’s reserve account applicable at the time of refund. If the payment is not expended within the five years due to delay attributable to the developer, the payment shall be refunded without interest.

e. Property owners entitled to a refund and/or interest under the provisions of this chapter may voluntarily and in writing waive their right to a refund for specified period of time in the interest of providing the designated capital improvement or other capital improvement or program identified by the property owner, and acceptable to the city.

f. The developer may voluntarily and in writing waive, on behalf of the developer and subsequent purchasers, the right to interest and or a refund in order to facilitate completion of an improvement. Under no condition shall such a waiver be required as a condition of approval. Such waiver shall be recorded with the county auditor and shall be binding on subsequent owners.

3. The developer or applicant may choose to pay a fee in lieu of reservation of all or portions of open space areas required. If the applicant offers to pay money in lieu of open space and if the city accepts the offer, the amount shall be determined based upon the square footage of open space which otherwise would have been required to be provided times the then-current market value per square foot of similarly situated property.

F. Appeals. Any decision of the city official or body made under this chapter, including the determination of direct impact, the type and amount of impact, the extent of the mitigation required, and the selection of the method of mitigation shall be subject to appeal in the same manner and at the same time as appeals of the underlying development permit. Failure to appeal such decision shall prevent the applicant from further judicial review of this issue. (Ord. 1533 § 8 (Exh. 94) (part), 2017).
