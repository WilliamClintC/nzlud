bitten a person should be caught and killed and the brain immediately submitted to a qualified laboratory for
rabies examination. An exception to this rule may be allowed for large, exotic, or valuable zoo species which,
by reason of their close confinement, would be unlikely rabies vectors. Rodents, rabbits, birds and reptiles are
not considered to be transmitters of the rabies virus and should not be submitted for laboratory examination for

ARTICLE 3.08 MITIGATION OF RUNOFF
Sec. 3.08.001 Findings of fact
(a) Construction practices of earth-filling and earth-excavating on lots and land tracts to elevate the land
above local flooding threats, or to divert existing runoff patterns, often disrupt the natural or existing historical
drainage patterns onto and off of neighboring lots or land tracts.
(b) All development within the city affects the special flood hazard areas, because all lands in the city drain to
streams that flow through special flood hazard areas as defined by national flood insurance maps for the
community of Lufkin.
(c) Mitigation of increased runoff for all development in the city is necessary and critical in order to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry generally and to further FEMA objectives.
(1995 Code, sec. 150.185; Ordinance 3323 adopted 6/16/1998)
Sec. 3.08.002 Purpose
The city has a substantial governmental interest in requiring and enforcing mitigation regulations. These
regulations will benefit all property owners in the city and will be applied proportionately in accordance with
scientific methodology. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare
by implementing provisions designed to:
(1) Minimize public and private costs associated with flooding in residential and business areas by
reducing flooding conditions in the city through more effective methods of developed runoff
mitigation;
(2) Provide protection to citizens from certain uncontrolled actions of others that may negatively
impact the value of private property;
(3) Protect development inside and outside special flood hazard areas from the cumulative effect
of development in the city at large;
(4) Reduce the proliferation of small, local detention ponds;
(5) Help enhance an increasing, stable tax base by offering the option of replacing small, local
detention on valuable uplands with space in large regional detention in lower value lowlands.

(1995 Code, sec. 150.186; Ordinance 3323 adopted 6/16/1998)
Sec. 3.08.003 Methods of mitigation
In order to accomplish its purpose, this article uses the following methods:
(1) Require all development to mitigate the effects of increased runoff created by said
development;
(2) Require a conditional development permit for all lot and land filling, and excavation or runoff
barrier construction;

Impervious areas. Areas of land or other surfaces that intercept rainfall, preventing it from being absorbed into
that surface.
Local detention. A detention feature built within the property lines of a proposed or existing development for the
purpose of mitigating only the developed runoff from that development.
Mitigation. Employment of physical or management means of limiting the impact of development upon the
existing surroundings; limiting the effects of increased runoff due to development activities.
Official benchmark. Any formally installed monument placed at a known elevation above mean sea level in
reference to the NAD 83 State Plane Coordinate System that is accepted by the city. Monument locations will

engineering report that demonstrates the runoff mitigation equivalence of replacement
detention in a regional detention basin to local or on-site mitigation. This report will form the
basis for negotiation that will result in a development agreement between the city and the
developer. Execution of the development agreement by the developer and the city manager or
his or her designee will complete the requirements for a development permit when
replacement detention, available in a regional detention basin, is elected. Existing small local
detention ponds may be abandoned only if an acceptable plan for replacement detention in a
regional detention basin is submitted in accordance with this article and a development
agreement is executed. Cost shall be based on the low bid of at least two bidders for the
excavation and transport of material from the regional detention facility at the time of the
agreement.
(2) Approval or denial of a development permit by the administrator or his or her designee will be
based on the following factors:
(A) Risk of localized flooding posed to existing development;
(B) Access limitations to the proposed development in times of flooding, including but not
limited to requirements of the emergency management director;
(C) Risk of flood damage to the proposed project;
(D) Cost of services to the proposed development during and after flooding;
(E) Availability of alternatives to the proposed project;
(F) Level of mitigation provided by the proposed development;
(G) Relationship of the development to the zone of influence of the local regional detention
facility. The zone of influence shall be as defined by the city engineer for each regional facility.
(c) Variances. The city council shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this article when there is an alleged error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article which contravenes the intent of this
article, including but not limited to unique site characteristics, timing of proposed development, or conflicts with
existing contracts.

ARTICLE 3.09 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION*
Division 1. Generally
Sec. 3.09.001 Statutory authorization
The legislature of the state has, in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Tex. Water Code section 16.315, delegated
the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore,
the city council does ordain the following provisions. (1972 Code, sec. 11-1/2-1; Ordinance 2180 adopted
4/20/1982; 1995 Code, sec. 151.01; Ordinance 3879 adopted 7/5/2006; Ordinance 3961 adopted 3/20/2007)
Sec. 3.09.002 Findings of fact
(a) The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an
increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
(1972 Code, sec. 11-1/2-2; Ordinance 2180 adopted 4/20/1982; 1995 Code, sec. 151.02; Ordinance 3879
adopted 7/5/2006; Ordinance 3961 adopted 3/20/2007; Ordinance 4270 adopted 9/21/2010; Ordinance 4294
adopted 11/16/2010)
Sec. 3.09.003 Statement of purpose
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 95/590
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(1972 Code, sec. 11-1/2-3; Ordinance 2180 adopted 4/20/1982; 1995 Code, sec. 151.03; Ordinance 3879
adopted 7/5/2006; Ordinance 3961 adopted 3/20/2007; Ordinance 4270 adopted 9/21/2010; Ordinance 4294
adopted 11/16/2010)
Sec. 3.09.004 Methods of reducing flood losses
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or
cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
and
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(1972 Code, sec. 11-1/2-4; Ordinance 2180 adopted 4/20/1982; 1995 Code, sec. 151.04; Ordinance 3879
adopted 7/5/2006; Ordinance 3961 adopted 3/20/2007; Ordinance 4270 adopted 9/21/2010; Ordinance 4294
adopted 11/16/2010)

commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, “new
construction” means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
New manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the

issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles,
the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading
and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation
on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of

damage occurred.
Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
(2) Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
Variance. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full
requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 103/590
base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 3.09.043(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(g) Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
article (section 3.09.003).
(h) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result.
(i) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure
and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(j) Prerequisites for granting variances:
(1) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
(2) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(A) Showing a good and sufficient cause;
(B) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
(C) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
(3) Any applicant to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will
be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the
cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
lowest floor elevation.
(k) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for
other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(1) The criteria outlined in subsections (a) through (i) of this section are met; and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 3.09.072 Specific standards
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section
3.09.007, section 3.09.042(8), or section 3.09.073(c), the following provisions are required:
(1) Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
(elevation certificate) to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed
in section 3.09.043(a)(1), is satisfied.
(2) Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated one foot above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such
certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. A registered
engineer or architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification (elevation certificate) to the
floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in section 3.09.043(a), is
satisfied.
(3) Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below
the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(A) A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

(4) Manufactured homes.
(A) Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's
FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage.
For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
(B) Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones
A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park
or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of
a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
(C) Require that manufactured homes being placed or substantially improved on sites in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the
community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section be
elevated so that either:
(i) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot above the base flood
elevation; or
(ii) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in
height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

Sec. 3.09.074 Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 3.09.007 are areas designated as
shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity
flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated one foot above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two
feet if no depth number is specified).
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures:
(A) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
(B) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base
specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of
effects of buoyancy.
(3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain
administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 3.09.043, are satisfied.
(4) Require within zone AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

4270 adopted 9/21/2010; Ordinance 4294 adopted 11/16/2010)
Sec. 3.09.075 Floodways
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 3.09.007 are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; and
(2) If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

accident should be removed by a tow truck, the police officer shall first determine whether or not the owner has
already made arrangements with an authorized tow truck service for the removal of his vehicle. If not, the police
officer shall request the owner to either designate an authorized company or allow a tow truck to be called from
the tow truck rotation list as follows:
(1) Request for tow truck. If the owner or operator selects a tow truck company, the investigating
officer shall notify the police dispatcher to call the tow truck company. If the requested tow truck
company is unable to promptly respond, then a rotation tow truck will be called.
(2) Rotation tow truck. If the owner does not designate a tow truck company to be called, the
investigating officer shall notify the dispatcher to call the tow truck company next in line on the tow
truck rotation list, and furnish its name to the investigating officer. A tow truck company called from

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 164/590
the tow truck rotation list may hereafter be referred to as a “rotation pull.” In such event, the
investigating officer shall notify the police dispatcher, who shall call the tow truck company next up
from the tow truck rotation list and dispatch it to the scene. The vehicle or vehicles to be removed
shall be taken to the place designated by the owner or by the investigating officer or to the tow truck
company's own place of storage if no designation is made or if it is being towed for no insurance. If
the responding tow truck company is unable to check enroute within ten (10) minutes and arrive at
the scene within twenty-five (25) minutes from the time dispatched, then the tow truck service next
on the rotation list shall be called. The disregarding of a tow truck dispatched shall be at the
discretion of the chief of police or his representative and shall be final. On each succeeding accident
or call, the next tow truck company on the rotation list will be called to respond. To effect the tow
truck rotation list procedure, the police department shall keep a master list of all tow truck companies
which meet all the requirements of this article and have qualified to be on the tow truck rotation list.

sec. 11, adopted 8/6/2013)
Sec. 4.08.013 Storage area
It shall be the responsibility of each tow truck company to provide a storage area for wrecked or disabled
vehicles which are moved or towed as the result of a police or rotation pull. The storage area shall be inspected
annually to determine whether it complies with the provisions of this section and maintains a current TDLR
license. A tow truck company shall not qualify for the rotation list unless:
(1) A tow truck company has a storage area of adequate size that will accommodate vehicles in a
safe manner.
(2) Each storage area shall be adequately lighted to illuminate the entire storage area as
determined by the chief of police.
(3) Storage areas are located within the corporate limits of the city.
(4) Vehicles are stored and arranged so that they may be promptly and safely removed upon
request as provided for herein.

Sec. 4.08.014 Fees for towing and storage
(a) Towing fees.
(1) Standard fees shall be set by the chief of police regarding routine small rotation pulls. Large
rotation pulls shall not exceed the usual and customary charges for like services provided in the tow
truck industry within the city.
(2) A tow truck operator may make a request for an “extraordinary tow” charge prior to assessing
fees in excess of usual and customary charges for like services provided in the tow truck industry
within the city. An “extraordinary tow” is the removal of a vehicle that, in the opinion of an on-scene
LPD officer, involves procedures, methods, or equipment not typically utilized during an ordinary
removal (e.g., hookup to a vehicle that is substantially above or below ground, the use of additional
tow trucks, cranes, ramps, jacks, or torches, or removal of spilled cargo). A tow truck operator
seeking such authorization must present to the LPD officer on-scene a “rotation tow truck fees” book
noting the reasons the tow should be treated as an extraordinary removal. The “rotation tow truck
fees” book shall be printed by the police department and made available to towing companies
through the department's traffic safety section.
(3) Fees for small rotation “extraordinary tow” shall be as set forth in the fee schedule.
(b) Storage charges. Storage charges shall not exceed usual and customary charges for like services
provided within the city commencing with the time the vehicle is placed inside the storage area. All storage
charges shall cease at the time the owner or his representative requests the vehicle from the storage yard of
the tow truck company, provided the request is made during regular business hours. No charge for storage

dollars as has been determined by the city council, but not to be less than $25,000.00. The bond to

surety and with the permittee as principal, running to the city for the benefit of the city and all

article in the drilling and operation of the well. The bond shall become effective on or before the date
the same is filed with the city secretary and remain in force and effect for at least a period of six
months subsequent to the expiration of the term of the permit issued, and in addition the bond will be
conditioned that the permittee will promptly pay off fines, penalties and other assessments imposed

article; and that the permittee will promptly restore the streets and sidewalks and other public
property of the city which may be disturbed or damaged in the operations to their former condition;

used, allowed or occurring in the drilling or producing operations, and will, after abandonment,
grade, level and restore the property to the same surface condition, as nearly as possible, as existed
when operations for the drilling of the well or wells were first commenced; and the permittee will
indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and all liability growing out of or attributable to the
granting of such permit. If at any time the city council members shall deem any permittee's bond to
be insufficient for any reason, it may require the permittee to file a new bond. If, after completion of a
well, the permittee has complied with all of the provisions of this article, such as removing the
derrick, clearing the premises, and the like, he may apply to the city council members to have the
bond reduced to a sum of not less than $10,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces
without reworking. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond shall be increased to the
original amount.
(2) Insurance.
(A) In addition to the bond required in subsection (1) of this section, the permittee shall carry
a policy or policies of standard comprehensive public liability insurance, including contractual

(B) The permittee shall file with the city secretary certificates of the insurance as above
stated, and shall obtain the written approval thereof by the city secretary, who shall act thereon
within ten days from the date of such filing. The insurance policy or policies shall not be
cancelled without written notice to the city secretary at least ten days prior to the effective date
of such cancellation. In the event the insurance policy or policies are cancelled, the permit
granted shall terminate, and the permittee's rights to operate under the permit shall cease until
the permittee files additional insurance as provided herein. If, after completion of a well, the
permittee has complied with all of the provisions of this article, such as removing the derrick,
clearing the premises, and the like, he may apply to the city council members to have the
insurance policies reduced for the remainder of the time said well produces without reworking,
as follows:
(i) Bodily injury, one person: $100,000.00.

Sec. 4.09.060 Supplemental permit for deeper drilling
Once any well has either been completed as a producer or abandoned as a dry hole, it shall be unlawful and an
offense for any person to drill such well to a deeper depth than that reached in the prior drilling operations

the city secretary specifying:

(3) The proposed casing program to be used in connection with the proposed deepening
operations;

the same tests as are in this article provided for in case of the drilling of the original well. In the event
the city council is satisfied that the well may be deepened with the same degree of safety as existed
in the original well, a supplemental permit may be issued without an additional filing fee to the
permittee authorizing the deepening and operation of the well to such specified depth as applied for.
In any deeper drilling or any deeper completion or any deeper production operations, the permittee
shall comply with all other provisions contained in this article and applicable to the drilling,
completion and operation of a well or wells.

ARTICLE 4.10 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES*

Sec. 4.10.001 Purpose
(a) It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses, to promote the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations.
These regulations prevent concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city and prevent the
establishment of these types of businesses near sensitive areas. The provisions of this article have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
(b) The city council finds that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious
effect on both the existing businesses around them and surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing
increased crime and the downgrading of property values. Numerous studies, reports and findings concerning
the harmful effects of sexually oriented businesses on surrounding land uses and neighborhoods have been
produced.
(c) It is the intent of the city council that the locational regulations of this article are promulgated pursuant to
Tex. Loc. Gov't Code, chapter 243.

vegetation in the clearing of land. See section 5.05.006 below for obtaining a permit to burn. “Land clearing
operation,” as defined by title 30, Texas Administrative Code, section 111.203(2), as adopted and as may be
amended, means “the uprooting, cutting, or clearing of vegetation in connection with conversion for the
construction of buildings, rights-of-way, residential, commercial, or industrial development, or the clearing of
vegetation to enhance property value, access, or production. It does not include maintenance burning of on-site
property wastes such as fallen limbs, branches, or leaves, or other wastes from routine property cleanup
activities, nor does it include burning following clearing for ecological restoration.”

permit.
(e) Public health and safety burns. Brush, trees, and other plant growth causing a detrimental public health
and safety condition may be burned by the city at a site it owns upon receiving site and burn approval from the
city manager. Such a burn may only be authorized when there is no practical alternative, and it may be done no
more frequently than once every two months. Such burns may not be conducted at a solid waste landfill owned
by the city unless authorized under 30 Texas Administrative Code section 111.215, and shall be subject to the
requirements of 30 Texas Administrative Code section 111.219.

trimmings, or other plant growth, by the owner of the property or any other person authorized by the owner, and
when the material is generated only from that property. Such burning is subject to the following requirements:
(1) Burning shall be commenced and conducted only when wind direction and other
meteorological conditions are such that smoke and other pollutants will not cause adverse effects to
any member of the public, public road, landing strip, navigable water, or off-site structure containing
sensitive receptor(s).
(2) If at any time the burning causes or may tend to cause smoke to blow onto or across a road or
highway, it is the responsibility of the person initiating the burn to post flagpersons on affected roads.
(3) Burning shall be conducted in compliance with the following meteorological and timing
considerations:
(A) The initiation of burning shall commence no earlier than one hour after sunrise. Burning
shall be completed on the same day not later than one hour before sunset, and shall be
attended by a responsible party at all times during the active burn phase when the fire is
progressing. In cases where residual fires and/or smoldering objects continue to emit smoke
after this time, such areas shall be extinguished if the smoke from these areas has the
potential to create a nuisance or traffic hazard condition. In no case shall the extent of the burn
area be allowed to increase after this time.
(B) Burning shall not be commenced when surface wind speed is predicted to be less than
six miles per hour (mph) (five knots) or greater than 23 mph (20 knots) during the burn period.
(C) Burning shall not be conducted during periods of actual or predicted persistent low level
atmospheric temperature inversions.
(4) Electrical insulation, treated lumber, plastics, non-wood construction/demolition materials,
heavy oils, asphaltic materials, potentially explosive materials, chemical wastes, and items
containing natural or synthetic rubber must not be burned.
(5) Burning shall not be conducted within fifty (50) feet of a structure.
Failure to comply with any requirement in this subsection shall authorize any public enforcement official to
require that a disposal fire be immediately extinguished, and may result in a citation, penalty, or other available
relief allowed under section 5.05.010 (enforcement and penalties) for the enforcement of this article.

This division shall be known as the City of Lufkin Smoking in Public Places Ordinance of 2013.
Sec. 6.02.032 Findings and intent
[(a) The city council does hereby find that:]

secondhand smoke is harmful;
(3) A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace;
(4) Studies undertaken across the country demonstrate that there is no significant adverse
economic impact as a result of indoor smoking bans; and
(5) Recent efforts to secure a local smoking ban suggest that residents of the city desire an
increase in the number of smoke-free areas.

emergency, the holder of a certificate or his authorized representative may request
authority from the fire department dispatcher to transport the patient on an emergency basis, that is,
with emergency siren and red warning lights operational and at such speeds as will transport the
patient to a medical facility in a safe and expeditious manner. This provision shall not operate to
relieve the driver of any licensed ambulance from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of
all persons, nor shall it protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the
safety of others.
(2) Upon granting authorization to transport on an emergency basis, the fire department

department assistance might be provided, as appropriate or necessary. Depending upon the

transfer” shall mean the time period after the patient enters the nonemergency ambulance and it is
driven onto the public street.

to respond to a specific emergency call, the fire chief, or his designee, may authorize a certificate
holder to respond to an emergency and make an emergency transport, with emergency siren and
red warning lights operational and at such speeds as will transport the patient to a medical facility in
a safe and expeditious manner. This provision shall not operate to relieve the driver of any licensed
ambulance from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall it protect the
driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.
(5) In cases of life threatening emergency, in which a local medical facility lacks the capability of
providing necessary patient care, and the city fire department, due to unavailability of ambulances, is
unable to transfer, the fire chief or his designee may authorize a certificate holder to transfer the
patient to the nearest medical facility that possesses such capability. In this event, the certificate
holder must immediately notify the fire department dispatcher of such transport so that police
department assistance might be provided, as appropriate or necessary. Upon notifying the fire
dispatcher, the certificate holder may transport with emergency siren and red warning lights
operational and at such speeds as will transport the patient to a medical facility in a safe and
expeditious manner. This provision shall not operate to relieve the driver of any licensed ambulance
from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall it protect the driver from
the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.

CITY OF LUFKIN
SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE
NO. 3693
Approved: April 6, 2004
Revised: January 4, 2012
I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1.1: Authority
A. The following rules and regulations are hereby adopted as the Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Lufkin,
Texas, also known and cited as the “Lufkin Subdivision Ordinance,” and shall be applicable to the filing of plats
and the subdivision of land, as that term is defined herein and in Chapter 212 of the Texas Local Government
Code, within the corporate City limits of the City of Lufkin, as they may be from time to time adjusted by
annexation or disannexation, and within all the areas of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Lufkin, as
that area may exist from time to time as provided by Chapter 42 of the Texas Local Government Code. The City
shall have all remedies and rights provided by said Chapter 212 with regard to the control and approval of
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 251/590
subdivisions and plats both within the City and within its extraterritorial jurisdiction. (Ordinance 3693 adopted
4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 1.2: Interpretation and Purpose
A. In the interpretation and application of the provisions of these regulations, it is the intention of the City
Council that the principles, standards and requirements provided for herein shall be minimum requirements for
the platting and developing of subdivisions within the City of Lufkin and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, and
superseding the previous Subdivision Ordinance (Ordinance No. 1170 Adopted on June 2, 1964 and
subsequent amendments).
B. The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban development. The distribution and
relationship of residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses throughout the community, along with the
system of improvements for thoroughfares, utilities, public facilities and community amenities, determine, in
large measure, the quality of life enjoyed by the residents of the community. Health, safety, economy, amenities,
environmental sensitivity, and convenience are all factors which influence and determine a community's quality
of life and overall character. A community's quality of life is of the public interest. Consequently, the subdivision
of land, as it affects a community's quality of life, is an activity where regulation is a valid function of municipal
government. The regulations contained herein are designed and intended to encourage the development of a
quality urban environment by establishing standards for the provision of adequate light, air, open space,
stormwater drainage, transportation, public utilities and facilities, and other needs necessary for ensuring the
creation and continuance of a healthy, attractive, safe and efficient community that provides for the
conservation, enhancement and protection of its human and natural resources. Through the application of
these regulations, the interests of the public, as well as those public and private parties, both present and
future, having interest in property affected by these regulations, are protected by the granting of certain rights
and privileges. By establishing a fair and rational procedure for developing land, the requirements in this
Ordinance further the possibility that land will be developed for its most beneficial use in accordance with
existing social, economic and environmental conditions.
C. The procedure and standards for the development, layout and design of subdivisions of land within the
corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Lufkin, Texas are intended to:
1. Promote the development and the utilization of land in a manner that assures the best possible
community environment in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning Ordinance of
the City of Lufkin;
2. Guide and assist the developers in the correct procedures to be followed, and to inform them of
the standards which shall be required;
3. Protect the public interest by supervising the location, design, class and type of streets,
sidewalks, utilities and essential areas and services required;
4. Assist orderly, efficient and coordinated development within the City limits and extraterritorial
jurisdiction;
5. Provide for neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of slums and blight;
6. Harmoniously relate the development of various tracts of land to the existing community, and
facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts;
7. Provide that the cost of improvements to minimum standards which primarily benefit the tract of
land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the tract, and that the cost of
improvements to minimum standards which primarily benefit the whole community be borne by the
whole community as contained in this Ordinance;
8. Provide the best possible design for each tract being subdivided;
9. Provide the most attractive relationship between the uses of land and buildings; provide for the
circulation of traffic throughout the municipality, having particular regard to the avoidance of
congestion in the streets and highways; provide for pedestrian circulation that is appropriate for the
various uses of land and buildings; and provide the proper location and width of streets;

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 252/590
10. Prevent pollution of the air, streams and ponds; assure the adequacy of drainage facilities;
safeguard both surface and groundwater supplies; and encourage the wise use and management of
natural resources throughout the municipality in order to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty
of the community and the value of the land;
11. Preserve the natural beauty and topography of the municipality, and ensure development that
is appropriate with regard to these natural features;
12. Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision;
13. Ensure that public or private facilities are available and will have sufficient capacity to serve
proposed and future subdivisions and developments within the City and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction;
14. Protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of the community;
15. Provide for adequate light, air and privacy; secure safety from fire, flood and other danger;
and prevent overcrowding of the land and undue congestion of population;
16. Protect the character and the social and economic stability of all parts of the community, and
encourage the orderly and beneficial development of all parts of the community;
17. Protect and conserve the value of land throughout the community and the value of buildings
and improvements upon the land, and minimize conflicts among the uses of land and buildings;
18. Guide public and private policy and action in providing adequate and efficient transportation
systems, public utilities, and other public amenities and facilities; and
19. Encourage the development of a stable, prospering economic environment.
D. Minimum standards for development, including all City Public Works, are contained in the City's Technical
Construction Standards & Specifications (TCSS) Manual, related technical standards, the Zoning Ordinance,
the Building Code and in this Ordinance. However, the Comprehensive Plan, the Future Land Use Plan, and
the City's Water and Wastewater Master Plans express policies designed to achieve an optimum quality of
development in the urban area. If only the minimum standards are followed, as expressed by the various
ordinances regulating land development, a standardization of development will occur. This will produce a
monotonous urban setting. Subdivision design shall be of a quality that will carry out the purpose and spirit of
the policies expressed within the Comprehensive Plan and within this Ordinance, and shall be encouraged to
exceed the minimum standards required herein.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 1.3: Application of Regulations
A. No subdivision plat within the City limits or the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be recorded until a
final plat, accurately describing the property to be conveyed, has been approved in accordance with this
Subdivision Ordinance. Furthermore, no building permit, certificate of occupancy, plumbing permit, electrical
permit, floodplain permit, utility tap, or certificate of acceptance for required public improvements shall be
issued by the City for any parcel of land or plat until:
1. A final plat has been approved in accordance with these regulations; and
2. All improvements, as required by these regulations, have been constructed and accepted by
the City of Lufkin, or
3. Assurances for completion of improvements have been provided in accordance with Section 6.

judgment shall be rendered, and it shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or
the application of them to other persons or circumstances. The City Council hereby declares that it would have

to be invalid.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)

Section 1.11: Petition for Hardship Waiver
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 255/590
A. Petition for Waiver. The applicant for a subdivision application, or the owner of the property subject
thereto, may petition the City Council for waiver of any standard of this Subdivision Ordinance or the imposition
of a condition related thereto, where the petitioner alleges that unreasonable hardships will result from strict
compliance with such standard or condition.
B. Procedures. A petition for a waiver shall be submitted in writing to the City Engineer (or designee) by the
petitioner at the time the subdivision application is filed for the consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application, and all of the facts relied upon by the
petitioner. The City staff shall prepare a report evaluating the request for waiver, and shall make its
recommendation to the Commission. The Commission shall make its recommendation and the City Council
shall finally act on the petition for a waiver in conjunction with the action taken by each on the subdivision
application.
C. Criteria for Approval. The City Council, following recommendation by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, may waive the standard or condition only upon finding that:
1. Granting the waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare, and will not be
injurious to other property;
2. The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is based are unique to the property for
which the waiver is sought, and are not applicable generally to other property;
3. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a
mere inconvenience, if the standard is strictly applied;
4. The waiver is not contrary to the intent and purpose of these subdivision regulations.
D. Conditions. In approving a waiver, the City Council may require such conditions as will, in its judgment,
secure substantially the purposes described in Section 1.2.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 1.12: Petition for Relief
A. Petition for Relief. The applicant for a subdivision application, or the owner of the property subject thereto,
may petition the City Council for relief from the application of any provision of this Subdivision Ordinance that
requires dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital improvements in order to
provide adequate water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities to serve the proposed subdivision, or the
imposition of a condition related thereto. The petition must allege that application of the provision or the
imposition of conditions relating to the provision and requiring such dedication of land or construction of capital
improvements is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed
development on the City's water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities system, as the case may be, or
does nor reasonably benefit the proposed development. The petition may also allege that the application of the
provision or the imposition of conditions relating to the provision deprives the applicant or the property owner of
the economically viable use of the land, or of a vested property right.
1. Prior to decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission on a subdivision application that is
subject to this Section, an applicant who proposes to challenge the application of a provision that
requires dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital improvements to
serve the proposed subdivision, or the imposition of conditions related thereto, shall file a notice of
intent to appeal such determination to the City Council. Approval of such subdivision application by
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall include a condition that approval is subject to the
Council's decision on the petition for relief.
2. If a petition for a waiver from the requirements of this Subdivision Ordinance pursuant to
Section 1.11 has been filed by the petitioner, the petition for relief may be submitted in conjunction
with the Council's review of such request.
3. The subdivision application may otherwise be decided by an administrative officer of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the petition for relief shall be submitted by the petitioner within
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 256/590
ten (10) calendar days of receiving the staff report applying the requirement or imposing the
condition.
B. Study Required. The applicant or property owner shall provide a study completed by a professional
engineer registered in the State of Texas in support of the petition for relief that includes the following
information:
1. Total capacity of the City's water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities system to be
utilized by the proposed development, employing standard measures of capacity and equivalency
tables relating the type of development proposed to the quantity of system capacity to be consumed
by the development. If the subdivision application is part of a phased development project, such
information shall also be provided for the entire development proposed, including any phase already
developed.
2. Total capacity to be supplied to the City's water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities
system by the proposed dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital
improvements. If the subdivision application is part of a phased development project, the information
shall include any capacity supplied by prior dedications or construction of capital improvements.
3. The study supplied by the petitioner shall be evaluated by City staff, who shall make its
recommendation to the Planning & Zoning Commission and City Council based upon the information
contained in the study and any additional information related to the petition produced by the staff. In
evaluating the petition, the staff shall take into account any traffic impact, drainage or other adequate
facilities studies evaluating the impacts of the development or similar developments on the City's
water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities systems.
C. Action on Petition. The City Council shall consider the petition and determine whether the application of
the provision requiring dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital improvements
in order to provide adequate water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities to serve the proposed
subdivision, or the imposition of a condition related thereto, is roughly proportional to the nature and extent of
the impacts created by the proposed development on such public facilities systems, and reasonably benefits
the development. In making such determination, the City Council shall consider the evidence submitted by the
applicant or property owner and the staff's recommendation. If the petition also alleges that the proposed
dedication or construction requirements constitute a deprivation of the economically viable use of the land or of
a vested property right, the Council shall also resolve such issues. Following such determinations, the Council
may take any of the following actions:
1. Deny the petition for relief, upon finding that the proposed dedication or construction
requirements are inadequate to offset the impacts of the development upon community water,
wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities, and either:
a. Deny the subdivision application; or
b. Require that additional dedications of rights-of-way for, or improvements to such, facilities
systems be made as a condition of approval of the application; or
2. Grant the petition for relief, and waive in whole or in part any dedication or construction
requirement that is not roughly proportional; or
3. Grant the petition for relief, and direct that the City participate in the costs of acquiring rights-ofway
for or constructing such facility pursuant to standard City participation policies.

A. No person who owes delinquent taxes, delinquent paving assessments, or any other delinquent debts or
obligations to the City of Lufkin, and which are directly attributable to a piece of property, shall be allowed to
record an approved plat or replat until the taxes, assessments, debts and/or obligations directly attributable to
said property and owed by the owner or previous owner thereof shall have been first fully discharged by
payment, or until an arrangement satisfactory to the City Engineer (or designee) has been made for the
payment of such debts or obligations. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to provide evidence or proof that
all taxes, assessments, debts and/or obligations have been paid. (Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as
revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 1.15: Right to Deny Hearing and/or Plat

to include, any information required by this Ordinance on any application for annexation, zoning, development
or subdivision of property. Misrepresentation, or deliberate omission, of facts pertaining to the plat on the
application form(s) or at a public meeting shall constitute grounds for denial of the plat.
B. Penalties and Exceptions. If any applicant for such hearing, or any owner of property subject to such
hearing, shall allow such hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the City Council to be
heard in violation of any of the provisions of the Ordinance, such person shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a penalty as per Section 1.13.

A. The subdivider(s) should avail themselves of the advice and assistance of the City officials, and should
consult early and informally with the City Engineer, Planning Director, and/or other designated administrative
officers before preparing a plat (e.g., a preliminary plat, final plat, amended plat, replat, etc.), and before formal
application for approval of same in order to save time, money and to avoid unnecessary delays. (Ordinance
3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 2.2: General Requirements and Procedures
A. Zoning Requirements. A property within the City's corporate limits that is being proposed for platting must
be properly zoned by the City prior to submission of an application for approval of any plat. In addition, the
proposed development layout or subdivision design shown on the proposed plat must be in conformance with
all standards and requirements prescribed in the City's Zoning Ordinance.
1. Noncompliance with the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is
located, or lack of the proper zoning, shall constitute grounds for denial of the plat. In situations
where the zoning on a particular piece of property cannot be ascertained by the City, the burden of
proof regarding the property's zoning shall rest with the property owner. Proof of proper zoning shall
consist of appropriate documentation, such as a copy of the ordinance establishing the zoning,
which shall be reviewed by City officials as to its validity and authenticity.
2. Any plat submitted for approval by the City shall be in accordance with the City's Zoning
Ordinance, if the property is located within the City's corporate limits, and, if the property is located
within the City's corporate limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction, it shall be in accordance with the City's
Comprehensive Plan, including all adopted water, sewer, storm drainage, future land use, park,
recreation, open space and thoroughfare plans. All plats shall be prepared by a registered
professional land surveyor.
B. Classification of Subdivisions and Additions. Before any land is platted (i.e., filed for record), the property
owner shall apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision plat, in accordance with the following
procedures, unless otherwise provided within this Ordinance. Subdivisions are classified as major or minor (see
definitions), depending upon the number of lots to be created and upon whether or not any public
improvements will be required to develop the property.
1. Minor subdivisions may be approved for residential or nonresidential properties. Minor plat
approval requires the submission of a final plat drawing and other submission materials required by
Section 2.10 of this Ordinance. Lots may be conveyed or sold only when the plat has been approved
and the plat has been filed with the Angelina County Clerk or as required by State Law.
2. Major subdivisions involve the creation of new streets, the construction/extension of a municipal
facility(s), and/or the creation of more than four (4) lots. Major subdivisions may be approved for
residential or nonresidential properties. Major plat approval shall be in accordance with Sections 2.4
and 2.5. All major subdivision plats must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission or
City Council in case of appeals, pursuant to this Ordinance, specifically Section 1.11 and 1.12. Lots

may be conveyed or sold only when the plat has been approved and the plat has been filed with the
Angelina County Clerk or as required by State Law.
C. Submission Requirements For All Types of Plat Applications. In addition to the requirements outlined
herein for each type of development application, the City shall maintain separate policies and procedures for
the submission and processing of applications including, but not limited to, application forms, checklists,
language blocks for plats, and other similar items. The forms and paperwork are available at the office of the
City Engineer, or designee. These policies and procedures may be amended from time to time, and it is the
applicant's responsibility to be familiar with, and to comply with, the policies and procedures.
D. Official Submission Date and Completeness of Application For All Types of Plats.
1. For the purpose of these regulations, the “official submission date” shall be the date upon which
a complete application for approval of any type of plat, that contains all required elements mandated
by the Texas Government Code, Section 212.004(b) and by this Ordinance, is submitted to the City
Engineer (or designee), after which the statutory period required for approval or disapproval of the
plat shall commence to run. No application shall be deemed officially submitted until the City
Engineer (or designee) determines that the application is complete and a fee receipt is issued by the
City. Failure by the City Engineer (or designee) to make a determination of incompleteness within
five (5) calendar days for a minor plat and ten (10) calendar days for a major plat following the date
on which the application was first received by the City, shall result in the application being deemed
complete, and the “official submission date” shall become the 6th or 11th calendar day, respectively,
following initial receipt of the application by the City.
2. Plat applications which do not include all required information and materials, as outlined below
and per other City development review policies which may change from time to time, will be
considered incomplete, shall not be accepted for official submission by the City, and shall not be
scheduled on a Commission agenda until the proper information is provided to City officials.
E. Action by Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
approve or disapprove a preliminary or final plat (or other type of plat, including replat) application, or shall
identify requirements which must be satisfied prior to approval of such application, within thirty (30) days of the
official submission date. For purposes of this Section, identification of requirements which must be satisfied
prior to approval of the application shall be considered denial of the plat application. In the case of an appeal to
the City Council after denial of a plat by the Planning and Zoning Commission, such appeal must be filed within
five (5) days and the City Council shall act upon the plat application within thirty (30) days following the
Commission's action.
F. Simultaneous Submission of Plats. In the event that an applicant submits preliminary and final plat
applications simultaneously, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall act upon both plats within (30) days of
the official submission date. The thirty (30) day period for action shall not be extended except upon the
execution of a written waiver by the applicant. No final plat shall be approved prior to the approval of the
preliminary plat.
G. Proof of Land Ownership. The City requires proof of land ownership prior to approval of any development
application involving real property. Along with the application submission, the applicant shall provide written
verification, such as a notarized statement or a power of attorney or other evidence satisfactory to the City
Engineer, that he or she is the owner of record of the subject land parcel or parcels, or is the property owner's
authorized agent. The City Engineer (or designee) shall have the authority to determine what document(s) the
City will require to prove ownership, such as one of the following:
1. General warranty deed;
2. Special warranty deed;
3. Title policy; or

interest. The applicant may resubmit a new development application, including the submission fees, for the
property at any time following such denial.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 2.3: Procedures and Submission Requirements for Preliminary Plat Approval
A. Upon reaching conclusions at the pre-application conference (as informally recommended in Section 2.1
above) regarding a general development program and objectives, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary
plat and preliminary construction information of the subdivision and other supplementary materials, as
specified. Preliminary construction information shall include any documentation necessary to give the City a
clear understanding of how the site will generally be served by required public services and facilities (e.g.,
water, sewer, roadway access, etc.). The preliminary plat shall be submitted to the City of Lufkin with the
appropriate filing fee (as provided in the City's plat submission guidelines, as may be amended from time to
time), and with a written application form at least twenty-one (21) calendar days (but no more than thirty
calendar days, unless the applicant waives the 30-day review time in writing) prior to the Planning and Zoning
Commission meeting at which it is to be considered. At the time the developer files a preliminary plat
application with the City Engineer (or designee), a certificate showing that all taxes have been paid on the
property to be subdivided, and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with Section
1.14, shall also be filed.

inches (24" x 30"), and drawn to a scale of one hundred feet or fifty feet to the inch (1" = 100' or 1" = 50'), shall
be submitted in the number of copies specified by the City (as provided in the City's plat submission guidelines,
as may be amended from time to time). Digital files, completed in a format that is compatible with software used
by the City such as CAD or GIS programs, of the proposed subdivision containing the same information as said
drawings shall also be submitted. In cases of large developments which would exceed the dimensions of the
sheet of one hundred foot (100') scale, preliminary plats may be on multiple sheets or may be two hundred feet
to the inch (l" = 200') or another known engineering scale, as approved by the City Engineer (or designee).
1. Preliminary plats which do not include the required data, number of copies and information will
be considered incomplete, shall not be accepted for submission by the City, and shall not be
scheduled on a Planning and Zoning Commission agenda until the proper information is provided to
City staff. Additional copies of the preliminary plat may be required if revisions or corrections are
necessary. A preliminary plat showing phasing of the development, shall include all contiguous
property under the ownership or control of the applicant. It may contain more than one phase which,
if so, shall be clearly identified.
C. The subdivider may choose to submit a final plat for review concurrently with the preliminary plat. In such
case, the City may schedule concurrent review of both plats, provided that all required information and other
items are submitted for both plats (including full construction plans and the appropriate assurances for the
completion of all improvements), and provided that adequate review can be achieved by the City. If the City
cannot review both plats (and other associated materials) within the twenty-eight (28) day review period, then
only the preliminary plat shall be considered for approval and the final plat shall be denied unless the thirty (30)
day review requirement is waived in writing by the applicant.
D. Following review of the preliminary plat and other materials submitted in conformity with these regulations,
and following discussions with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of
improvements to be installed, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall act upon the preliminary plat as it was
submitted, or as modified. If approved, the Commission shall state the conditions of such approval. If the
Planning and Zoning Commission denies the application, and an appeal of the denial is filed within five (5)
days, the City Council shall act upon the application within thirty (30) days following the Commission's denial.

1. The Planning and Zoning Commission (or City Council in the case of an appeal) shall only
approve the actual plat drawing (i.e., the sheet(s) showing the actual plat for the subdivision, which
will be filed at the County in “Final Plat” form), and the screening wall/landscaping plan(s) (as a
separate agenda item) if the project/subdivision includes any required screening device (e.g., along

such disapproval and the reasons therefor. The plat application is not forwarded to City Council for
consideration unless the applicant submits a written appeal within five (5) calendar days following the
Commission's decision. The City Council shall take action within thirty (30) days following the Planning and
Zoning Commission's action. The City Council may affirm, modify or reverse (i.e., override) the decision of the

K. Effect of Approval. Approval of a preliminary plat and construction plans authorizes the property owner,
upon fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval, to commence construction of all required
improvements (or submission of the proper assurances for construction of same, per Section 6), to submit an
application for final plat approval.
L. Expiration of Plats and Reinstatement Procedure.
1. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for three (3) years and all undeveloped areas
within the preliminary plat boundary shall lapse unless reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission in light of new or significant information which would necessitate the revision of the
preliminary plat. If no development or change in requirements has occurred which would affect the
proposed plat at the end of the three-year period, the Planning and Zoning Commission may, at the
request of the applicant and upon a recommendation by City staff, extend its approval another year
without the submission of a new preliminary plat by re-approving the original preliminary plat. No
filing fee is required for such re-approval. If no request for re-approval is made by the developer or
property owner prior to the three-year preliminary plat anniversary date, then the entire preliminary
plat shall be deemed expired and shall be null and void.
a. The engineering construction plans shall also be valid as long as the preliminary plat is
valid after approval of the plans by the City.
2. Prior to the lapse of approval of a preliminary plat, the property owner may petition the City to
extend approval. Such petition shall be considered at a public meeting before the Planning and
Zoning Commission, and an extension may be granted by the Commission at such public meeting.
3. In determining whether to grant such a request, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with any
conditions attached to the original approval, and the extent to which newly adopted subdivision
regulations shall apply to the plat. The Commission shall extend the preliminary plat, or deny the
request, in which instance the property owner must submit a new application for approval or may
appeal the Commission's decision to the City Council. An appeal shall be filed within five (5) days
and the City Council shall act upon the application within thirty (30) days following the Commission's
action.
4. The Commission may extend the approval for a specific time period, subject to additional
conditions based upon newly enacted regulations, or such as are necessary to ensure compliance
with the original conditions of approval.
M. Timing of Public Improvements.
1. The Planning and Zoning Commission may permit all or some of the public improvements to be
installed, offered for dedication, and/or accepted by the City after approval of the final plat by the
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 269/590
City. Also see Section 6.
a. The Commission may permit or require the deferral of the construction of public
improvements if, in its judgment, deferring the construction would not result in any harm to the
public or would offer significant advantage in coordinating the site's development with adjacent
properties and off-site public improvements. The deferred construction of any required public
improvement(s) must be approved by the City at the time of preliminary plat approval, and the
necessary assurances for completion of the improvements (in accordance with Section 6) shall
be a stipulation (i.e., condition) of approval of the preliminary plat.
2. If the Commission does not require that all public improvements be installed, offered for
dedication and/or accepted by the City prior to approval of the final plat, it shall require that the
applicant provide assurances/security for the completion of the improvements, as provided in
Section 6.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 2.4: Procedures and Submission Requirements for Final Plat Approval
A. The final plat shall be in accordance with the preliminary plat, as approved, and shall reflect/incorporate all
applicable conditions, changes, directions and additions imposed by the Planning and Zoning Commission
upon the preliminary plat. The final plat shall not be approved by the City until all utilities, infrastructure, and
other required improvements have been constructed according to the engineering/construction plans, as
approved by the City Engineer, unless provisions are made for the completion of the improvements in
accordance with Section 6. The final plat shall not be submitted prior to approval of the preliminary plat (see
Section 2.3 for exception). At the time the developer files a final plat application with the City Engineer (or
designee), he shall also file a certificate showing that all taxes have been paid on the property to be subdivided,
and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with Section 1.14.
B. The final plat shall constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider
proposes to record provided, however, that such portion conforms to all the requirements of these regulations.
C. The required number of copies of the proposed final plat shall be submitted at least twenty-one (21)
calendar days (but no more than thirty calendar days, unless the applicant waives the 30-day review time in
writing) before the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which it shall be considered, accompanied by
an application form and an application fee (per the City's plat submission guidelines, as may be amended from
time to time). The City Engineer (or designee) shall check the plat to ascertain its compliance with these
regulations and shall report to the applicant. If revisions are necessary, the applicant, developer or his engineer
shall submit additional corrected copies of the properly completed final plat to the City Engineer (or designee),
along with a written request for a 30-day extension of the review period (thereby waiving the State-mandated
30-day review time for plats). If the written request for a 30-day extension is not submitted, then the plat will be
recommended for denial. Failure to submit corrected copies back to the City in time shall be reason to
determine the submittal as incomplete and as reason to not schedule the final plat on the Commission's
agenda. The final plat application will thereupon be returned to the applicant with the reasons stated as to why
the plat is incomplete. A minimum of three (3) review copies of the Final plat shall be submitted to the
Engineering Department. Once the review process is complete a minimum of five (5) copies of the final plat
shall be submitted to the Engineering Department.
1. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the final plat
within thirty (30) days of the official submission date (unless waived in writing by the applicant). If the
Planning and Zoning Commission denies the application, and an appeal of the denial is filed within
five (5) days, the City Council shall act upon the application within thirty (30) days following the
Commission's denial. After the final plat has been scheduled on an agenda, the applicant or
subdivider may request, in writing, a waiver of the thirty (30) day approval requirement. After receipt
of the request, the City may delay approval of the final plat beyond thirty (30) days of the submission
date. A certificate of approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission, attested by the Chairperson
of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Secretary, as provided herein, shall be
attached on the plat when such final plat has been approved. If the City Council approves the final
plat after an appeal has been made, the certificate of approval shall be attested by the Mayor or
Mayor Pro-Tem instead of the Planning and Zoning Commission Chairperson.

2. The developer and/or applicant shall return copies of the final plat, as approved, with any other
required documents and necessary fees attached thereto to the City Engineer (or designee) within
thirty (30) days, in accordance with requirements established by the City. All easements shall be
included as required by utility companies and/or the City of Lufkin prior to filing, and a copy of letters
from each applicable utility company shall be submitted to the City Engineer (or designee) stating
that the plat contains the proper easements. Mylars, reductions and blueline copies as required by
the County Clerk of Angelina County, in addition to inylar copies and a computer disk or email
containing the digital plat file(s) required by the City, shall be returned to the City Engineering
Department with the required fees. If the required copies and materials are not returned to the City
within the specified time, the City approval of the final plat shall be null and void unless an extension
is granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The City Engineer (or designee) shall file the
final plat within ninety (90) days at the office of the County Clerk of Angelina County.
D. The final plat (and any replats) shall be prepared by a registered professional land surveyor (RPLS).
E. When all of the improvements are found to be installed in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications, and after the improvements have been completed, and upon receipt by the City of Lufkin of a
maintenance bond or certificate of deposit in accordance with Section 6 of this Ordinance from each contractor,
three (3) sets of “As-Built” (or “Record Drawing”) plans and one (1) set of “As-Built” or “Record Drawing” mylars,
blueline copies, and computer disk(s) containing the digital construction plan(s), as required by the City, shall
be submitted with a letter stating the contractor's compliance with these regulations. After such letter is
received, the City Engineer (or designee) shall receive and accept for the City of Lufkin the title, use and
maintenance of the improvements according to Section 6.6. The final plat shall not be approved prior to receipt
of the above letter and other items, nor prior to acceptance of the improvements by the City.

(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 2.6: Replatting
A. Replat Required. Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a property owner who proposes to replat
any portion of an already approved final plat, other than to amend or vacate the plat, must first obtain approval
for the replat under the same standards and by the same procedures prescribed for the final platting of land by
these regulations. All improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the same requirements as for a
preliminary or final plat, as provided herein. The City Engineer (or designee) may waive or modify requirements
for a preliminary plat under circumstances where the previously approved preliminary plat is sufficient to
achieve the purposes set forth in this Ordinance.
B. Replatting Without Vacating Preceding Plat. A replat of a final plat or portion of a final plat may be
recorded and is controlling over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the replat:
1. Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being replatted;
2. Is approved, after a public hearing on the matter at which parties in interest and citizens have
an opportunity to be heard, by the Planning and Zoning Commission; and
3. Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions previously incorporated in
the final plat.
C. Previous Requirements or Conditions of Approval Which Are Still Valid. In addition to compliance with B
above, a replat without vacation of the preceding plat must conform to the requirements of this section if:
1. During the preceding five (5) years, any of the area to be replatted was limited by an interim or
permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two (2) residential units per lot;
or
2. Any lot in the preceding plat was limited by deed restrictions to residential use for not more than
two (2) residential units per lot.
3. Notice of the public hearing required under B above shall be given before the fifteenth (15th)
day before the date of the public hearing by the Planning and Zoning Commission by publication in
an official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation in Angelina County. Notice of the public
hearing shall also be given by written notice, with a copy of any requested waivers/suspensions,
sent to the owners, as documented on the most recently approved ad valorem tax roll of the City, of
lots that are in the original subdivision and that are within two hundred (200) feet of the lot(s) to be
replatted. In the case of a subdivision in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the most recently approved
County tax roll shall be used. The written notice may be delivered by depositing the notice, properly
addressed with postage prepaid, in a post office or postal depository within the boundaries of the
City. If the replat is denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission and appealed to the City
Council, no public hearing is required at the City Council.
4. If the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the owners of the area of lots to whom notice
is required to be given under Subsection C.3 above file with the City a written protest of the
replatting before or at the public hearing, and if the replat requires a waiver/suspension as defined in
Section 1.11, then approval of the replat will require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4)

Section 2.9: Plat Vacation
A. By Property Owner. The property owner of the tract covered by a plat may vacate, upon the approval of
the Planning and Zoning Commission, the plat at any time before any lot in the plat is sold. The plat is vacated
when a signed, acknowledged instrument declaring the plat vacated is approved and recorded in the manner
prescribed for the original plat.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 277/590
B. By All Lot Owners. If some or all of the lots covered by the plat have been sold, the plat, or any part of the
plat, may be vacated on the application of all the owners of lots in the plat with approval obtained in the manner
prescribed for the original plat.
C. Criteria. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall approve the petition for vacation on such terms and
conditions as are in accordance with Section 212.013 of the Texas Local Government Code, and as are
reasonable to protect the public health, safety and welfare. As a condition of vacation of the plat, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may direct the petitioners to prepare a revised final plat in accordance with these
regulations such that the property does not become “unplatted.”
D. Effect of Action. On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument, the vacated plat shall have no
effect. Regardless of the Planning and Zoning Commission's action on the petition, the property owner or
developer will have no right to a refund of any monies, fees or charges paid to the City nor to the return of any
property or consideration dedicated or delivered to the City except as may have previously been agreed to by
the Planning and Zoning Commission. An appeal of the Commission's action may be made to the City Council;
such an appeal shall be filed within five (5) days and the City Council shall act upon the application within thirty
(30) days following the Commission's action.
E. City-Initiated Plat Vacation.
1. General Conditions. Upon an individual affirmative vote of both the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council the City may vacate the plat of an approved subdivision or addition
when:
a. No lots within the approved plat have been sold within five (5) years from the date that the
plat was signed by the City;
b. The property owner has breached an improvement agreement and the City is unable to
obtain funds with which to complete construction of public improvements, except that the
vacation shall apply only to lots owned by property owner or its successor; or
c. The plat has been of record for more than five (5) years and the City determines that the
further sale of lots within the subdivision or addition presents a threat to public health, safety
and/or welfare, except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by the property owner or
its successors.
2. Procedure. Upon any consideration of the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council to
vacate the plat of any previously approved subdivision or addition, in whole or in part, the City shall
publish notice in the official City newspaper of general circulation, and shall also notify the property
owner(s) within the boundaries of the plat proposed to be vacated. The notice shall state the time
and place for a public hearing on the motion to vacate the subdivision or addition plat. The
Commission shall recommend approval and the City Council shall approve the vacation only if the
criteria and conditions cited above are satisfied.
3. Record of Notice. If the Commission and City Council approve vacating a plat, the City
Secretary shall record a copy of the resolution or ordinance in the office of the County Clerk of
Angelina County with a copy of the area or plat vacated. The County Clerk shall write legibly on the
vacated plat the word “vacated” and shall enter on the plat a reference to the volume and page at
which the vacating instrument is recorded. If the Commission and City Council adopt a resolution or
ordinance vacating a plat in part, it shall cause a revised final plat to be recorded which shows that
portion of the original plat that has been vacated and that portion that has not been vacated. On the
execution and recording of the vacating instrument the vacated plat has no effect.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 278/590
B. The City Engineer (or designee) and Director of Planning (or designee) may approve a minor plat, or may,
for any reason, elect to present the minor plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council for
consideration and approval. Any decision made on the minor plat by the City Engineer (or designee) and
Director of Planning (or designee) shall be approval of the plat. Should the City Engineer (or designee) and
Director of Planning (or designee) refuse to approve the minor plat, then the plat shall be referred to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration within the time period required by State law.
C. Notice, a public hearing, and the approval of other lot owners are not required for the approval [of] a minor
plat.
D. The minor plat shall be entitled and clearly state that it is a “minor plat.”
E. The minor plat shall be filed at the County in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat.
F. When an existing non-platted parcel, of one acre or larger, is divided from a parent tract of ten acres or
more, the owner of the tract is required to prepare a one lot subdivision plat. This is permitted one time only.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
III. SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 3.1: Streets
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the City of
Lufkin's Thoroughfare Plan and the TCSS Manual, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets or driveways, to topographical conditions, to public safety and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. Reserve or residual strips of land controlling access to
or egress from other property, or to or from any street or alley, or having the effect of restricting or damaging the
adjoining property for subdivision purposes or which will not be taxable or accessible for improvements shall not
be permitted in any subdivision. All streets shall be constructed in accordance with Section 5 and with the
TCSS Manual.
B. Proposed streets shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for vehicular and pedestrian
circulation and shall be properly related to the Thoroughfare Plan and any amendments thereto, and shall be
appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each proposed subdivision or development. All public
streets shall be open and unobstructed at all times. For private streets, see Subsection c.9 [C.9] below.
C. Adequacy of Streets and Thoroughfares.
1. Responsibility for Adequacy of Streets and Thoroughfares. The property owner shall assure
that the subdivision is served by adequate streets and thoroughfares, and shall be responsible for
the costs of rights-of-way and street improvements, in accordance with the following policies and
standards, and subject to the City's participation in the costs subject to the City's oversize policy for
oversize facilities.
2. General Adequacy Policy. Every subdivision shall be served by streets and thoroughfares
adequate to accommodate the vehicular traffic to be generated by the development. Proposed
streets shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for traffic circulation, and shall be
properly related to the City's Thoroughfare Plan, road classification system, Comprehensive Plan
and any amendments thereto, and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of
each development.
3. Road Network. New subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having adequate
capacity, and safe and efficient traffic circulation.
4. Approach Roads and Access. All subdivisions must be connected to the City's improved
thoroughfare and street system by one or more approach roads of such dimensions and approved to
such standards as are hereinafter set forth. Requirements for dedication of right-of-way and
improvement of approach roads may be increased depending on the density or intensity of the
proposed development, if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 279/590
a. The subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for public
safety vehicles. Each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a minimum frontage on a
dedicated street as required by applicable zoning (or if no such requirement exists, minimum
frontage of 30'), unless other provisions have been authorized through planned development
approval.
5. Street Dedications.
a. Dedication of Right-of-Way and Road Improvements. The property owner shall provide all
rights-of-way required for existing or future streets, and for all required street improvements,
including perimeter streets and approach roads, as shown in the Thoroughfare Plan or other
valid development plans approved by Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council.
(1) Whenever an existing street has insufficient right-of-way to meet current standards
for street widths, the owner or subdivider shall dedicate the necessary right-of-way along
the common property line to provide for the street width standard. Generally, the amount
of dedication will be equal to that which is required to equal one-half (1/2) of the street
width standard when measured from the centerline of the street. However the amount of
right-of-way dedication shall ultimately be based on that which is necessary to maintain
continuity with adjacent tracts or parcels and future right-of-way needs.
b. Perimeter Streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision or
addition, the other half of the street shall be dedicated and improved by the developer of the
subdivision or addition.
c. Slope Easements. The dedication of easements, in addition to dedicated rights-of-way
shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall be in excess of three feet (3') horizontal to one foot
(1') vertical.
6. Street Construction. All streets and thoroughfares shall be constructed to City standards and in
rights-of-way as required by the Thoroughfare Plan, in accordance with the TCSS Manual and/or
other City standards as may be from time to time adopted.
7. Intersection improvements and traffic-control devices shall be installed as warranted in
accordance with the traffic impact analysis required by subsection (f) [F.]. Construction and design
standards shall be in accordance with City standards and the TCSS Manual.
8. Phased Development. Where a subdivision is proposed to occur in phases, the subdivider, in
conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat, shall provide a schedule of development. The
schedule shall set forth the intended plan of development and dedication of rights-of-way for streets
and street improvements, whether on-site or off-site, intended to serve each proposed phase of the
subdivision. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine whether the proposed streets
and street improvements are adequate pursuant to standards herein established and may require
that a traffic impact analysis be submitted for the entire project or such phases as the Commission
determined to be necessary to adjudge whether the subdivision will be served by adequate streets
and thoroughfares. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require temporary improvements, as
required for public safety, which will be removed upon construction of additional phases of
development.
9. Private Streets. All private streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
City's standards for publicly dedicated streets. The term “private street” shall be inclusive of alleys, if
such are to be provided within the subdivision.
a. Subdivision Eligibility Criteria. Private streets shall be permitted only within a subdivision
satisfying each of the following criteria:
(1) No street shall be less than five hundred (500) feet in length;
(2) The streets to be restricted to private use are not intended for regional or local
through traffic circulation (see subsection 3.1c.9.(b) below);
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 280/590
(3) The subdivision is not located adjacent to an existing or approved public street
subdivision that can be reasonably connected, even though the street connection would
require construction of a bridge or culvert - the two subdivisions shall be connected as
public street subdivisions;
(4) A mandatory property (homeowners) association, which includes all property to be
served by the private streets, will be formed (see subsection 3.1c.9.(e) below); and
(5) The subdivision conforms to any other special guidelines for private street
developments as may be approved separately by the Planning and Zoning Commission
or City Council.
b. Streets Excluded. Streets that are shown on the City's Thoroughfare Plan as collectors
(Types “C” and “D”) or arterials (Types “A” and “B”) shall not be used, maintained or
constructed as private streets, and a private street subdivision shall not cross or interfere with
an existing or future collector or arterial street. Also, the Planning and Zoning Commission or
City Council may deny the creation of any other private street if, in their sole judgment, the
private street would:
(1) Negatively affect traffic circulation on public streets, or
(2) Impair access to the subject or adjacent property; or
(3) Impair access to or from public facilities, including schools or parks; or
(4) Cause possible delays in the response time of emergency vehicles.
c. Access Onto Public Thoroughfare. A private street subdivision shall provide a minimum of
seventy feet (70') of access frontage on a public collector or arterial street for subdivision
entrances; primary access into a private street subdivision shall be from a collector (Type “C”
and “D”), as shown on the City's Thoroughfare Plan, or from a larger roadway. Restricted
access entrances shall not be allowed from minor collectors (Type “D”), minor residential/local
streets (Type “E”), rural streets (Type “F”), or from alleys. No more than two (2) gated street
entrances may intersect a thoroughfare that is designated on the City's Thoroughfare Plan as
Type “D” or larger within any one (1) mile segment.
d. Parks and Greenbelts Excluded. A private street subdivision shall not cross or interfere
with an existing or future public pedestrian pathway, hike and hike trail, greenbelt or park as
shown on the City of Lufkin's Park Master Plan.
e. Property (Homeowners) Association Required. Subdivisions developed with private
streets shall have a mandatory property owners association which includes all property served
by the private streets. The association shall own and be responsible for the maintenance of
private streets and appurtenances. The association documents must establish a reserve fund
for the maintenance of streets and other improvements. The association documents shall be
reviewed and approved by the City Attorney to ensure that they conform to this and other
applicable City rules and regulations. The documents shall be filed of record prior to final plat
approval. Lot deeds must convey membership in the association, and most provide for the
payment of dues and assessments required by the association. The association may not be
dissolved without the prior written consent of the City Council. No portion of the association
documents pertaining to the maintenance of private streets and alleys, and assessments
therefor, may be amended without the written consent of the City Council.
f. Private Street Lot. Private streets must be constructed within a separate lot owned by the
property owners association. This lot must conform to the City's standards for public street
rights-of-way. An easement covering the street lot shall be granted to the City providing
unrestricted access to and use of the property for any purpose deemed necessary by the City.
This right shall also extend to all utility providers operating within the City. The easement shall
also permit the City to remove any vehicle or obstacle within the street lot that may impair
emergency access.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 281/590
g. Construction and Maintenance Cost. The City shall not pay for any portion of the cost of
constructing or maintaining a private street.
h. Infrastructure/Utilities. All water, sewer and drainage facilities, streetlights, and trafficcontrol
devices (e.g., signs) placed within the private street lot shall be installed to City
standards, and shall be dedicated to the City prior to filing the record plat for the subdivision.
All private traffic-control devices and regulatory signs shall conform to the “Texas Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices.” All City regulations relating to infrastructure financing,
developer cost participation, and capital cost recovery shall apply to developments with private
streets.
(1) The metering for utilities such as water, gas and electricity shall be located on the
individual lots to be served, not grouped together in a single (or multiple) centralized
location (i.e., no centralized “gang-box” style metering stations).
i. Plans and Inspections. Development applications for subdivisions with private streets must
include the same plans and engineering information required for public streets and utilities.
City requirements pertaining to inspection and approval of improvements shall apply, and fees
charged for these services shall also apply. The City may periodically inspect private streets,
and may require any repairs necessary to ensure efficient emergency access and/or to protect
the public health, safety, convenience and welfare.
j. Restricted Access. The entrances to all private streets must be clearly marked with a sign,
placed in a prominent and visible location, stating that the streets within the subdivision are
private, and that they are not maintained by the City. Guard houses, access control gates, and
cross-arms, if used, shall be constructed per subsection (k) below. All restricted access
entrances must be manned twenty-four (24) hours every day, or they must provide an
alternative means of ensuring access to the subdivision (preferably with an Opticom-type
system for emergency access) by the City and other utility or public service providers (e.g.,
postal carriers, utility companies, etc.) with appropriate identification. If the association fails to
maintain reliable access as required herein, the City may enter the subdivision and remove
any gate or device which is a barrier to access at the sole expense of the association. The
association documents shall contain provisions in conformity with this Section that may not be
amended without the written consent of the City Council.
k. Access Restricted Entrance Design Standards. Any private street which has an access
control gate or cross-arm must have a minimum uninterrupted pavement width of twenty-seven
feet (27') at the location of the gate or access control device (both ingress and egress)
regardless of the type of device used. If an overhead (e.g., lift-up) barrier is used, it must be a
minimum of fourteen feet (14') in height above the road surface, and this clearance height shall
be extended for a minimum distance of fifty feet (50') in front of and behind the location of the
device. All gates and cross-arms must be of a break-away design. A minimum vehicle stacking
distance of fifty feet (50') shall be provided from the right-of-way line of the public road from
which the private street subdivision is accessed to the first vehicle stopping point, which is
usually an access request keypad/telephone or guard's window. Adequate distance shall be
provided between the access request point(s) and the entry barrier (e.g., gate) to
accommodate a vehicle turn-around as described below.
(1) A paved turn-around space must be located in front of any restricted access
entrance barrier (i.e., between the access request device and the barrier/gate) to allow
vehicles that are denied access to safely exit onto public streets without having to back
up (particularly into the public street upon which the entrance is located). The design and
geometry (i.e., pavement width, inside radius, etc.) of such turn-around shall be such that
it will accommodate smooth, single-motion U-turn movements by the following types of
vehicles:
(a) Larger passenger vehicles (e.g., vans, pickup trucks, etc.);
(b) Passenger vehicles with short trailers up to twenty-four feet (24') in length
(e.g., small flatbed, camping or box-type trailers); and
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 282/590
(c) The types of service and utility trucks that typically visit or make deliveries to
neighborhoods that are similar to the proposed private street development (e.g.,
utility company vehicles, postal/UPS delivery trucks, two- to three-axle flatbed or
box-type trucks used by contractors and moving companies, etc.).
City staff and/or the Planning and Zoning Commission may require
submission of additional drawings, plans and/or exhibits demonstrating that
the proposed turn-around will work and that vehicle turn-around movements
will not compromise public safety on the entry roadway or on the adjacent
public street(s). The design of all proposed access restricted entrances (i.e., a
site plan) must be submitted for review and approval by the City Engineer,
Police Department and Fire Department along with the construction plans for
the subdivision prior to construction and approval of the final plat.
l. Waiver of Services. The subdivision final plat, property deeds and property owners
association documents shall note that certain City services shall not be provided for private
street subdivisions. Among the services which will not be provided are: routine law
enforcement patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking regulations, and preparation of
accident reports. Depending upon the characteristics of the development and upon access
limitations posed by the design of entrances into the subdivision, other services (such as
sanitation) may not be provided.
m. Petition to Convert to Public Streets. The property owners association documents shall
allow the association to petition the City to accept private streets and any associated property
as public streets and right-of-way upon written notice to all association members and upon the
favorable vote of a majority of the membership. However, in no event shall the City be
obligated to accept said streets as public. Should the City elect to accept the streets as public,
then the City has the right to inspect the private streets and to assess the lot owners for the
expense of needed repairs concurrent with the City's acceptance of the streets. The City shall
be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed. The City may also require, at the
association's expense, the removal of any guard houses, access control devices, landscaping
and/or other aesthetic amenities located within the street lot. The association documents shall
provide for the City's right to such removal and assessment. Those portions of the association
documents pertaining to the subject matter contained in this Section shall not be amended
without the written consent of the City.
n. Hold Harmless. On the subdivision final plat shall be language whereby the property
owners association, as owner of the private streets and appurtenances, agrees to release,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, any other governmental entity, and any public
utility entity for damages to the private streets that may be occasioned by the reasonable use
of the private streets by same, and for damages and injury (including death) arising from the
condition of the private streets, out of any use of access gates or cross-arms, or out of any use
of the subdivision by the City or governmental/utility entity.
D. Escrow Policies and Procedures.
1. Request for Escrow. Whenever these regulations require a property owner to construct
(including design, engineering and construction) a street or thoroughfare (or other type of public
improvement), the property owner may petition the City to construct the street or thoroughfare in
exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this section. If the property owner requests escrow
in lieu of constructing more than one street or thoroughfare required to meet adequacy standards for
roadways, the City may establish separate escrow accounts for such affected roadways, or may
determine that some roadways should be constructed, while escrow should be accepted from [for]
others. The City Engineer (or designee) shall advise the Planning and Zoning Commission whether
escrow is to be accepted in lieu of the obligation to construct a street or thoroughfare.
2. Deposit With the City. Whenever the City agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of
construction by the owner of the property under these regulations, the property owner or developer
shall deposit an amount equal to his share of the costs of design and construction in escrow with the
City. Such amount shall be paid prior to release of construction plans by the City. The obligations
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 283/590
and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of property owner's transferees,
successors and assigns; and the liability therefor shall be joint and several.
3. Determination of Escrow Amount. The amount of the escrow shall be determined by the City
Engineer using the average of several comparable bids that were awarded by the City in the
preceding six (6) months or, if none exist, then in the preceding year or, if none exist, by using
current costs of construction (including engineering design fees, contingencies, administrative fees,
and related costs) as determined by an estimate by the City. Such determination shall be made as of
the time the escrow is due hereunder.
4. Termination of Escrow. Escrows which have been placed with the City under this section which
have been held for a period of ten (10) years from the date of such payment or agreement, in the
event that the City has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for construction of
such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made, shall upon written request be returned to the
property owner, with accrued interest.
5. Refund. If any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other
than the City, or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the City, the
escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the property owner or developer who
originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements. In
the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the City and the other portion of the cost by another
party or governmental authority, the difference between the owner's actual proportionate cost and
the escrowed funds, including accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded after completion and
acceptance of the improvements.
6. Interest Limitation. If money is refunded within six (6) months of deposit, only the principal will
be refunded. Monies returned after this date will be refunded with interest accrued, calculated at one
percent (1%) less than the rate of actual earnings.
E. Any preliminary plat or plat involving a significant change to a proposed roadway alignment from that
shown on the City of Lufkin's Thoroughfare Plan may be required to be preceded by submission and approval
of a traffic impact analysis as specified in Subsection F below.
F. Traffic Impact Analysis. If the City Council or Planning and Zoning Commission requires a traffic impact
analysis, the following elements shall be included:
1. General Site Description. The traffic impact analysis shall include a detailed description of the
roadway network within one (1) mile of the site, a description of the proposed land uses, the
anticipated states [stages] of construction, and the anticipated completion date of the proposed land
development shall be provided. This description which may be in the form of a map, shall include the
following items: (1) all major intersections; (2) all proposed and existing ingress and egress
locations; (3) all existing roadway widths and rights-of-way; (4) all existing traffic signals and trafficcontrol
devices; and (5) all existing and proposed public transportation services and facilities within a
one (1) mile radius of the site.
2. Proposed Capital Improvements. The traffic impact analysis shall identify any changes to the
roadway network within one (1) mile of the site that are proposed by any government agency or
other developer. This description shall include the above items as well as any proposed construction
project that would alter the width and/or alignment of roadways affected by the proposed
development.
3. Roadway Impact Analysis.
a. Transportation Impacts:
(1) Trip Generation. The average weekday trip generation rates (trip ends), the
average weekend trip generation rates (uses other than residential or institutional), the
highest average a.m. and p.m. hourly weekday trip generation rates, and the highest
hourly weekend generation rates (uses other than residential or institutional) for the
proposed use shall be determined based upon the trip generation rates contained in the
most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation Manual;
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 284/590
or shall be based upon data generated by actual field surveys of area uses compatible to
the proposed use and approved by the City Engineer of the City of Lufkin.
(2) Trip Distribution. The distribution of trips to arterial and collector roadways within
the study area identified in subsection 3.1.F.1 (General Site Description) above shall be
in conformity with accepted traffic engineering principles, taking into consideration the
land use categories of the proposed development; the area from which the proposed
development will attract traffic; competing developments (if applicable); the size of the
proposed development; development phasing; surrounding existing and anticipated land
uses, population and employment; existing daily traffic volumes based on City traffic
counts or traffic counts conducted by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT);
projected daily traffic volumes; and existing traffic conditions identified pursuant to
subsection 3.1.F.1 above.
b. Adequacy Determination:
(1) The roadway network included within the traffic impact analysis shall be considered
adequate to serve the proposed development if existing roadways identified as arterials
and collectors can accommodate the existing service volume, and the service volume of
the proposed development, and the service volume of approved but unbuilt
developments holding valid, unexpired building permits at a level of service “C” or above.
4. Intersection Analysis.
a. Level of Service Analysis:
(1) For intersections within the roadway traffic impact analysis study area described in
subsection 3.1.F.1 herein, a level of service analysis shall be performed for all
arterial/arterial, arterial/collector, collector/collector intersections and other intersections
identified by City staff. Also, level of service analyses will be required on all proposed site
driveway locations for all nonresidential developments. The City may waive analysis of
minor intersections and site driveway locations within the one-mile radius. The level of
service analysis shall be based upon the highest hourly average a.m. or p.m. peak
weekday volume or highest average hourly peak weekend volume as determined from a
two-day survey of weekday volumes and, where necessary, a one-day survey of
weekend volumes. The level of service analysis shall take into consideration the lane
geometry, traffic volume, percentage of right-hand turns, percentage of left-hand turns,
percentage of trucks, intersection width, number of lanes, signal timing and progression,
roadway grades, pedestrian and bicycle flows, school routes, number of accidents, and
peak hour factor.
b. Adequacy Analysis.
(1) The intersections included within the traffic impact analysis shall be considered
adequate to serve the proposed development if existing intersections can accommodate
the existing service volume, the service volume of the proposed development, and the
service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid, unexpired building
permits at level of service “C” or above.
5. Effect of Adequacy Determination.
a. If the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed
development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection
within the study area identified in subsection 3.1f.1 herein that would cause the roadway to fall
below the level of service required hereto, the proposed development shall be denied unless
the developer agrees to one of the following conditions:
(1) The deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the
substandard facilities are constructed;
(2) A reduction in the density or intensity of development;
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 285/590
(3) The dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service
required herein; or
(4) Any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that
development will not occur unless the levels of service for all roadways and intersections
within the traffic impact analysis study are adequate to accommodate the impacts of such
development.
G. Arrangement of Streets Not Shown on the Thoroughfare Plan. For streets that are not shown on the City's
Thoroughfare Plan (e.g., local residential streets), the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into surrounding
areas;
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the City to meet a particular
situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets
impractical;
3. Provide for future access (i.e., provide stubbed streets for future extension) to adjacent vacant
areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification;
4. Not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings.
H. Minor residential streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged, but
access is provided to adjacent subdivisions.
I. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the City may require marginal
access streets, reverse frontage (lots which back onto the arterial), deep lots with rear service alleys, or such
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection to residential properties and to afford separation of
through and local traffic.
J. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely
placed by the City under conditions approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
K. Intersecting, undivided streets with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five feet (125') shall
be avoided. Intersecting streets onto a divided roadway must be configured such that the centerline offset will
accommodate the appropriate left-turn lanes (with required transition and stacking distances) onto each of the
two intersecting streets.
L. Major thoroughfare intersections shall be at ninety degree (90°) angles and tangent to the intersecting
street for at least fifty feet (50'). Other street intersections shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect at less than eighty degrees (80°).
M. Street right-of-way widths shall be shown on the Thoroughfare Plan, and where not shown therein shall
be shown in the TCSS manual. The City may approve rural type construction design (Type “F”), (i.e. without
curb and gutter) for residential streets with a minimum right-of-way width of sixty feet where property has the
zoning classification of “Residential Large” or “Agricultural” only, based upon a recommendation from the City
Engineer and approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
N. Construction of half-streets shall be prohibited, except when essential to the reasonable development of
the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of these regulations and the Thoroughfare Plan, and
where the City makes a determination that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full
street section since no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question. The City may also
find that it would be more practical (and/or cost effective) to delay construction of the other half of a street when
the adjoining property is developed.
O. The maximum length of any block or street segment shall be one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'), as
measured along the street centerline and between the point(s) of intersection with other through (i.e., not deadend
or cul-de-sac) streets.
P. Except as provided in Subsection Q below, a residential cul-de-sac shall not exceed 1000 feet nor serve
more than thirty (30) dwelling units. A nonresidential cul-de-sac shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet. The
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 286/590
closed end shall have a turn-around bulb with an outside pavement diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a
right-of-way diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet. The length of a cul-de-sac shall be measured from the
centerline of the intersecting street to the centerline of the cul-de-sac bulb.
Q. Based upon a City staff recommendation, the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve
waivers/suspensions for overlength streets and/or cul-de-sacs upon consideration of the following:
1. Alternative designs which would reduce street/cul-de-sac length;
2. The effect of overlength streets upon access, congestion, delivery of municipal services, and
upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in traveling to and from their homes; and
3. Means of mitigation, including but not limited to additional mid-block street connections,
limitation on the number of lots to be served along an overlength street segment or cul-de-sac,
temporary (or permanent) points of emergency access, and additional fire protection measures.
R. Except in unusual cases, no dead-end streets will be approved unless such dead-end streets are provided
to connect with future streets on adjacent land. In the case of dead-end streets which will eventually be
extended into the adjacent subdivision, no more than one lot (per side) can front onto the dead-end street stub
unless a temporary turn-around bulb (with an off-site easement, if necessary) is provided at the end. A deadend
street shall not exceed six hundred feet (600') in length, and the temporary turn-around bulb must be
constructed like a cul-de-sac, as provided in subsection (p) [P.] above (the City Engineer may authorize the use
of asphalt or other durable paving material than concrete for the arc portions of the temporary turn-around bulb
in order to minimize the cost of removing those portions later on). A note shall be placed on the final plat clearly
labeling any dead-end streets (if any) that will at some point be extended into the adjacent property, and
signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub (on the barricade) also stating that the street
will be extended in the future.
S. New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets, and shall be
dedicated at equal or greater right-of-way widths than the existing streets.
T. Construction of New Streets. All new streets dedicated within a subdivision shall be constructed in
accordance with paving widths and specifications as set forth in the TCSS Manual of the City of Lufkin at the
time at which the final plat is approved, and crosswalks and barrier-free ramps shall be provided and designed
in accordance with ADA requirements.
U. Points of Access. All residential developments shall provide no less than one (1) entrance for every one
hundred (100) lots, or portion thereof. Dead-end stubbed streets that will eventually provide connections into
adjacent future developments and then to an existing arterial or collector street may be considered as providing
the required access. Subdivisions with four hundred (400) or more lots may submit a traffic impact analysis
showing that additional entrances are not needed for future traffic generation levels. Based upon
recommendations of the traffic impact analysis, the City Engineer may waive the requirement for additional
entrances into the subdivision.
V. Streets will be constructed in accordance to the TCSS Manual that is in effect at the time of subdivision
construction.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 3.2: Alleys
A. Alleys shall be optional. If alleys are provided, they shall be designed in accordance with the TCSS
Manual.
B. Residential alleys shall not be required except to connect to a subdivision with existing alleys for the
purpose of providing continuity. If alleys are constructed or required, the following standards shall be met:
1. In residential districts, alleys shall be parallel, or approximately parallel, to the frontage of the
street. Alleys in residential districts shall be designed in accordance with the TCSS Manual.
2. Alleys shall be paved in accordance with the City of Lufkin TCSS Manual that is in effect at the
time of subdivision construction.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 287/590
3. Where the deflection of alley alignment occurs, the design of the paving and property line shall
be as established by the TCSS Manual.
4. Dead-end or “hammerhead” alleys shall not be allowed. Alleys must have adequate turnouts
and street entrances such that vehicular traffic flow is continuous and efficient. Where a temporary
dead-end alley situation is unavoidable, a temporary turn-around bulb or turnout onto a street (either
of which will need a temporary easement for street/alley purposes) shall be provided as determined
by the City Engineer.
5. Alleys may not exceed a maximum length of one thousand two hundred feet (1,200), as
measured along the centerline of the alley and between intersections with other alleys or entrances
onto streets (at the right-of-way line of the street at the alley entrance). The Planning and Zoning
Commission and/or City Council may approve waivers/suspensions for overlength alleys upon
consideration of the following:
a. Alternative designs which would reduce alley length;
b. The effect of overlength alleys upon access, congestion, delivery of municipal services,
and upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in accessing rear driveways and in
driving around to the front of their homes; and
c. Means of mitigation, including but not limited to additional mid-block alley turnouts,
limitation on the number of lots to be served along a single alley segment, temporary points of
access, and additional fire protection measures.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 3.3: Easements
A. Easements across lots or centered along rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where
necessary, and shall be of such widths as may be reasonably necessary for the utility or utilities using same. A
minimum utility easement fifteen feet (15') wide or wider, as determined by the City Engineer, or any applicable
utility company on both sides of the street adjacent to all street rights-of-way shall be provided for gas, electric,
and other utilities approved by the City. It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to determine appropriate
easement widths as required by other utility companies. All easements shall be accessible by the City and/or by
other applicable utility companies, and accessibility shall be in conformance with the City's (and/or the other
utility company's) policies regarding same.
B. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, or channel, there shall be provided a
stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with such course and of such additional
width as may be designated by the City Engineer (or designee), subject to determination according to proper
engineering considerations. The required width shall conform to the requirements set forth by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Parallel streets or parkways may be required adjacent to certain
portions of creek[s] or drainageways to provide maintenance access or access to recreation areas (see Section
4). City approved utilities are permitted within the drainage easement.
C. A minimum ten-foot-wide (10'-wide) drainage and utility easement shall be provided along the front of all
lots, adjacent to and flush with the street right-of-way line for the potential placement of utility facilities.
D. For new development, all necessary on-site easements shall be established on the subdivision plat and
not by separate instrument, and they shall be labeled for the specific purpose, and to the specific entity, for
which they are being provided. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: a water, sanitary sewer or
drainage easement, which is dedicated to the City for a water or sanitary sewer line or for a drainage structure;
an access easement, which is dedicated to the public for unrestricted access purposes; a fire lane easement,
which is dedicated to the City for emergency access purposes; an electrical, gas, telephone or cable television
easement, which is dedicated to the specific utility provider that requires the easement; and so on.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 3.4: Blocks
A. The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 288/590
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use
contemplated.
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes, setbacks and dimensions.
3. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
B. In general, intersecting streets, determining the blocks' lengths and widths, shall be provided at such
intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately, to provide adequate fire protection, and to meet existing streets or
customary subdivision practices. Where no existing subdivision controls, the block lengths shall not exceed one
thousand two hundred feet (1,200) in length. Where no existing subdivision controls, the blocks shall not be
less than five hundred feet (500) in length; however, in cases where physical barriers or property ownership
creates conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be increased or
decreased to meet the existing conditions having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic and
public safety.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 3.5: Lots
A. Lots shall conform to the minimum requirements of the established zoning district.
B. Each lot shall front onto a dedicated, improved public street. Lot width and access shall conform with the
provisions of the City of Lufkin's Thoroughfare Plan. Lot access onto arterial and collector streets is subject to
approval by the City Engineer (or designee), who may require a traffic study or other data/information prior to
approval of the preliminary plat in order to fully study all access issues. In all cases, lots shall have a minimum
of thirty feet (30') of frontage along a dedicated, improved street.
C. Irregular-shaped lots shall have sufficient width at the building line to meet lot width and frontage
requirements of the appropriate zoning district. Also, the rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all
necessary utilities, including garbage collection when alleys are present.
D. Side lot lines shall be generally at right angles or radial to street lines.
E. Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where they may be essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arterials as defined in Section 3.1 or to overcome specific disadvantage to
topography and orientation. Where lots have double frontage, building setback lines shall be established for
each street side. Screening shall be provided in accordance with Section 5.7 [sic].
F. Flag Lots
1. Applicants considering use of a flag lot shall meet with staff prior to the design of the
subdivision to determine if a flag lot is appropriate.
2. Flag lots shall be limited to sites with unusual conditions in topography (drainage, slope, grade,
or geological informality), shape (meaning the lot is irregularly shaped and not based on standard
angles forming square or rectangular designs), or size (in circumstances where there is not
adequate building area due to existing easements or insufficient leftover land).
3. Applications for plats utilizing flag lots shall be received by Staff, recommended for approval or
disapproval by Staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved or disapproved by
Council when the plat is within 200 feet of an established neighborhood of predominantly singlefamily
or duplex homes. An established neighborhood is an area containing 75% completed
structures in which there are homogenous grouping of individuals, buildings or businesses within a
larger community. The groupings may be separated from each other by physical barriers or invisible
boundaries. Neighborhood associations identified by the Lufkin Community Police section shall be
accepted as an established neighborhood for the purpose of this standard.
4. Flag lots shall not be created as a substitute for construction of a city street. The Developer
shall have the burden of proofing the appropriateness of a flag lot when the City Engineer or the
Director of Planning recommends construction of a street to provide access to individual lots and city
services.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 289/590
5. Driveway construction plans may be required by the City Engineer to demonstrate adequate
ingress and egress (for emergency vehicles) in a proposed development with a flag lot. The
applicant shall submit plan profiles for the driveways if requested by the City when the adequacy of
lot access is questioned.
6. In areas developed predominately residential (75% or more residentially zoned land within 200
feet of the proposed flag lot), access from a city street to a flag lot shall be on land which is owned in
fee simple by the owner of said flag lot. The access stem of a flag lot shall be limited to the exclusive
use of that attached flag lot and shall not be used for access to another lot.
7. In areas developed predominately as commercial (75% or more non-residentially zoned land
within 200 feet of the proposed flag lot), access from a city street to a flag lot may be provided for
joint use to adjacent lots to limit street accesses along a commercial street. The City Engineer and
Planning Director shall evaluate a proposed joint access utilizing a flag lot stem to insure adequate
access is provided for all users.
8. No portion of an access stem shall be included in computing the required lot area for a flag lot
for zoning purposes.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 3.6: Reserved
Editor's note–Former section 3.6 pertaining to building lines and deriving from Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004 was
repealed in its entirety by Ordinance 4284 adopted 10/19/2010.
Section 3.7: Utility Services (not provided by the City of Lufkin)
A. For purposes of this section, the following meanings shall apply:
1. Utility services. The facilities of any person, firm or corporation providing electric, telephone,
cable television, water service, gas or any other such item or service for public use approved but not
provided by the City of Lufkin.
2. Lateral lines. Those utility lines used to distribute service from a feeder line to a single
subdivision. These electric lines are normally connected to a feeder line through a sectionalizing
device such as a fuse.
3. Service lines. Those utility lines used to connect between the utilities' supply system or lateral
lines and the end user's meter box.
B. All subdivision plats and construction plans filed with and submitted to the City of Lufkin for approval shall
provide for utility services such as electrical, gas, telephone and cable TV utility (lateral and/or service
distribution) lines and wires to be placed underground. Feeder and other major transmission lines may remain
overhead within the appropriate easements. However, a subdivider shall endeavor and, whenever practical, the
City shall require that feeder lines are placed away from traffic arteries (Thoroughfare Types “A” and “B”).
Whenever practical, feeder lines which are to be placed overhead shall not be placed along both sides of the
street right-of-way. Verification of acceptance of easement locations and widths by the public utilities shall be
provided prior to final plat approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and all easements shall be
reviewed by the utility companies and City Engineer for the City prior to granting final approval for all residential
subdivisions affected by this section.
C. Each of the utility companies shall be responsible for developing administrative policies, criteria for
easement size, and cost reimbursement procedures for the installation and extension of their underground
utilities. Nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict any utility company from recovering the difference in cost of
overhead facilities and underground utilities from the owner or developer in accordance with the provisions of
such utility's approved tariff. No utility company shall be required or permitted to begin construction of
underground facilities unless and until the owner or developer of the subdivision has made arrangements
satisfactory to the specific utility company for the payment of such difference between the cost of overhead
facilities and underground facilities.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 290/590
D. All electrical and telephone support equipment, including transformers, amplifiers, and switching devices
necessary for underground installations, shall be pad-mounted or mounted underground, but not overhead
(unless the subdivision is served from perimeter overhead electrical facilities).
E. Temporary construction service may be provided by overhead electric lines and facilities without obtaining
a waiver/suspension or exception, provided that when the underground utility service to any portion of a
subdivision is completed, such overhead electric lines and facilities are promptly removed.
F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any existing facilities in place prior to the effective date
of this Ordinance to be placed underground.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 3.8: Water and Wastewater Facility Design
A. All new subdivisions shall be connected with an approved water system designed and constructed in
accordance with the TCSS Manual, as amended, and shall be capable of providing water for health and
emergency purposes, including fire protection. All subdivisions must be served by an approved means of
wastewater collection and treatment. The City may require the phasing of development and/or improvements in
order to maintain adequate wastewater capacity. It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to extend utility lines
to provide water or sanitary sewer service, and to procure any necessary off-site easements for required public
improvements (e.g., easements for utilities, street stubs/temporary turn-arounds, drainage facilities, etc.).
B. It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to design all improvements according to the latest edition of the
Comprehensive Plan and Water and Wastewater Master Plans, and/or the TCSS Manual, whichever are
applicable. No sewer main or water main for fire service shall be less than six (6) inches in size. The City may
require that the subdivider oversize the water system and/or the sanitary sewer system where necessary to
serve land other than the tract or lots to be platted, including the oversizing of off-site water or sewer mains
necessary to extend service to the property to be platted. If the City requires oversizing, the City shall pay the
difference in all associated construction cost between the required utility and the oversized utility. The cost shall
be determined by providing a minimum of three bids which have a based bid for required utilities and an
alternate bid for the oversized utilities. The City utility extension policy is as follows:
1. Inside City Limits: If the extension of service to a property is inside the City limits of Lufkin, the
City will extend utility service to the nearest property line that is the most advantageous to the City.
The extension of service will be at no cost to the Owner or the Developer. Any upgrades in
infrastructure will be completed by the City at no cost. All construction will be in accordance with the
Fire Code, TCEQ, and the City Subdivision Ordinance, whichever is more restrictive.
2. Outside City Limits: For a Subdivision or Development requiring more than one meter - If the
extension of service to a property is outside the City limits of Lufkin, the Developer will extend utility
service to the property under the supervision of City Staff and based on construction plans approved
by the City Engineer. All construction will be in accordance with the Fire Code, TCEQ, and the City
Subdivision Ordinance, whichever is more restrictive. The cost of the extension of utility service will
be borne solely by the Developer. Any upgrades in infrastructure required to meet fire, pressure,
and/or TCEQ rules will be completed by the Developer at their expense. In the event of future
connections to the utility service by other Subdivisions or Developers, the original Developer will be
reimbursed a prorated share based on a per unit cost for a period of up to five (5) years. The cost
shall be determined based on the point of connection of the new development. After five (5) years,
no cost will be reimbursed to the Developer. Sewer service is not provided outside the City Limits of
Lufkin.
3. Individual Residence or Meter: If the extension of service to a property is outside the City limits
of Lufkin, the City will extend utility service to the property for the first two hundred feet (200') at no
cost to the Owner. The Owner will be required to reimburse all material, labor, and administrative
costs for all service beyond the first two hundred feet (200'). Upgrade requirements will be the
responsibility of the City.
C. Extension of water and wastewater lines adjacent to any subdivision shall be made along the entire
frontage of the subdivision adjacent to a street or thoroughfare. If the subdivision is not adjacent to a
thoroughfare, the extension of utilities shall be accomplished in such a manner as to allow future connection to

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 291/590
said utilities by new subdivisions. If new subdivisions will never be constructed beyond a developing subdivision
due to physical constraints, the City Engineer may waive the requirement for adjacent utility line construction.
D. Installation of utilities not specifically referenced herein shall comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the City of Lufkin, Angelina County (when applicable), and the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ).
E. The City of Lufkin may aid in development, depending upon scheduling, in the construction of curb and
gutter residential subdivisions by allowing for use of City crews and equipment in the installation of water and
sewer infrastructure. The purchase of all material is the express requirement of the developer.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 3.9: Stormwater Collection/Conveyance Systems
System Design Requirements. Drainage improvements shall accommodate runoff from the entire upstream
drainage area, and shall be designed to prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system.
The City may require the phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention or detention,
and/or the construction of off-site drainage improvements in order to mitigate the impact of the proposed
development. No stormwater collection system shall be constructed within the City unless it is designed in
accordance with the City of Lufkin's Drainage Criteria Manual for the Design of Storm Drainage Systems by a
registered professional engineer and approved by the City Engineer. All developed areas shall have concrete
curb and gutter drainage systems unless the development has an average lot size of at least one (1) acre.
These lower density developments can utilize drainage ditch systems or swales if recommended by the City
Engineer and the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the City Council. All plans submitted to
the City Engineer for approval shall include a layout of the system together with supporting calculations for the
design of the system. In addition to any others, the plans shall conform to the City of Lufkin's Drainage Criteria
Manual. (Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
IV. PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES
Section 4.1: Areas for Public Use
A. The subdivider shall give consideration to suitable and adequate sites for schools, parks, playgrounds,
and other areas for public use or service so as to conform with the recommendations contained in the City's
Comprehensive Plan, Parks, Recreation & Open Space Master Plan, and other applicable plans. Any provision
for schools, parks and/or other public facilities shall be indicated on the preliminary plat and shall be subject to
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
B. No individual, partnership, firm, or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute or change the course or
location of any existing ditch, channel, stream, or drainageway, without first obtaining a floodplain development
permit or written permission of the City or other agency having jurisdiction.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 4.2: Protection of Drainage and Creek Areas
A. Definitions and Methodology for Determining the Floodway Management Area (FMA). The definitions for
“floodway” and floodway fringe” shall correspond to those set forth by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the concept of a floodway is used as a
tool to assist the local community in the aspect of floodplain management. Under this concept, the area of the
100-year flood is divided into a floodway and floodway fringe. The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any
adjacent floodplain areas that must be kept free of encroachment in order that the 100-year flood may be
carried without substantial increases in flood heights as defined by FEMA. The area between the floodway and
boundary of the 100-year flood is termed the floodway fringe.
1. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Floodway Management Area (FMA) will correspond to
any and all special flood hazard areas indicated on the most recent FEMA Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM).
B. Areas Where a Floodway Management Area (FMA) is Required.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 292/590
1. All drainage areas or regulated floodways as referenced on the Floodway and Flood Boundary
Map (FIRM Maps) that cover the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be included in the FMA.
If FEMA does not specify a floodway zone in any of the creeks or their tributaries, it shall be the
developer's responsibility to establish and identify the FMA. The determination shall be made by a
registered professional engineer and approved by the City Engineer. Where improvements to a
drainage area are required by other ordinances of the City for the purpose of safety or other reasons
related to drainage, those ordinances shall also be observed. The FMA is intended to apply to a
creek or channel which is to remain open or in its natural condition. The creek shall remain in its
natural state unless improvements are permitted by the City due to the pending development of
properties adjacent to or upstream of the required improvements.
2. In areas where no FMA is designated, the developer shall provide a twenty-foot-wide (20'-wide)
easement from the top of the bank of a creek or channel with slopes of at least 5:1.
C. No individual, partnership, firm, or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute or change the course or
location of any existing ditch, channel, stream or drainageway, without first obtaining written permission of the
City and any other agency having jurisdiction.
D. Ownership and Maintenance of the FMA. The area determined to be the FMA shall be designated on and
part of the final plat. Approximate locations shall be shown on zoning change requests and preliminary plats. At
the City's option, the FMA shall be protected by one of the following methods:
1. Dedicated to the City of Lufkin, at the developer's option; or
2. Easement(s). Creeks or drainageways in tracts which have private maintenance provisions,
other than single- or two-family platted lots, can be designated as the FMAs by an easement to the
City on the final plat. Subdivisions with platted single-family or two-family lots may designate the
FMA by easement provided there is adequate maintenance provisions, but no lots or portions of lots
may be platted in the easement unless specifically allowed by the City. The area designated as FMA
may be identified by a tract number; or
3. Certain recreational uses normally associated with or adjacent to floodprone areas (no
structures allowed in the FMA), such as golf courses. The uses allowed shall be in conformance with
the Zoning Ordinance.
a. Prior to acceptance of any drainageway as an FMA by the City, the area shall be cleared
of all debris. Floodway management areas dedicated to the City shall be left in a natural state
except those areas designated for recreational purposes.
E. Design Criteria. The following design criteria shall be required for development adjacent to the FMA:
1. Adequate access must be provided along the FMA for public or private maintenance. An
unobstructed area a minimum of twenty feet (20') wide with a maximum 5:1 slope (five feet
horizontal to one foot vertical), the length of the floodway shall be provided adjacent to or within the
FMA. On the opposite side of the drainage area, an unobstructed area having a minimum width of
five feet (5') shall be provided.
2. Lots in a single-family, PD single-family or duplex residential zoning district shall not be platted
within the FMA. If lots back to an FMA, at least two reasonable points of access to the FMA, each a
minimum of twenty feet (20') in width, shall be provided. Streets and alleys may qualify as access
paints if designed such that they are navigable by maintenance vehicles. All areas of the FMA must
be accessible from the access points. Lots used for multifamily may be platted in the FMA if the FMA
is identified as an easement and is maintained as open space for use by the residents.
3. Public streets may be approved in the FMA by the Planning and Zoning Commission, if they
conform to applicable engineering standards.
4. Public streets may be required to be constructed adjacent to some portions of the FMA to allow
access for maintenance or recreational opportunities.
5. No building sites shall be located within the floodway.
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 293/590
6. Alternate designs to facilitate equal or better access may be permitted if approved by the City
Engineer.
F. Drainage areas which have been altered and are not in a natural condition can be exempted from an FMA
and this Section at the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission and upon recommendation by the
City Engineer.
G. Any construction within the FMA (including, but not limited to, grading, clearing, construction of utility lines,
etc.) shall require issuance of a floodplain permit prior to commencement of such construction.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 4.3: Property/Homeowners Associations
A. Applicability. When a subdivision contains either common open space or other improvements which are
not intended to be dedicated to the City of Lufkin for public use (e.g., private streets, private recreation facility,
landscaped entry features, etc.), a property/homeowners association agreement consistent with State and other
appropriate laws, must be submitted to and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and made a
part of the final plat documents. The Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions (i.e., CCRs) and the association
documents (i.e., articles of incorporation, bylaws) shall be submitted to the City for review and City approval
along with the preliminary plat application, and such documents must contain provisions that satisfy the
requirements outlined within this Section. Said documents must, at a minimum, include provisions which allow
the City to take over the maintenance of common property (including private streets, private recreation facilities,
etc.) using association funds, if such action becomes necessary due to nonperformance or inaction by the
association or if the association goes defunct. Provisions shall also be included which would, in the latter
instance, convey ownership of the private streets (if any) and all other common areas to the City, and which
would allow the City to remove any improvements/amenities from the common areas and sell any buildable
land area (as residential lots) to recoup the City's expenses for maintenance and/or demolition of the
improvements. Any monies that remain after the City has recovered all of its expenses shall be retained for
future maintenance/upgrading of the streets, common areas (if any remain), screening walls, or other
improvements within the subdivision.
B. Membership. A property/homeowners association shall be an incorporated nonprofit organization
operating under recorded land agreements through which:
1. Each lot owner within the described land area is automatically a member (i.e., membership in
the association is mandatory); and
2. Each lot is automatically subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for the
property/homeowners association's activities, such as maintenance of common open spaces or the
provision and upkeep of common recreational facilities.
C. Legal Requirements. In order to assure the establishment of a proper property/homeowners association,
including its financing, and the rights and responsibilities of the property/homeowners in relation to the use,
management and ownership of common property, the subdivision plat, dedication documents, covenants, and
other recorded legal agreements must:
1. Legally create an automatic membership, nonprofit property/homeowners association;
2. Place title to the common property in the property/homeowners association, or give definite
assurance that it automatically will be so placed within a reasonable, definite time;
3. Appropriately limit the uses of the common property;
4. Give each lot owner the right to the use and enjoyment of the common property;
5. Place responsibility for operation and maintenance of the common property in the
property/homeowners association;
6. Place an association charge on each lot in a manner which will both assure sufficient
association funds and which will provide adequate safeguards for the lot owners against undesirable
high charges;
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 294/590
7. Give each lot owner voting rights in the association; and
8. Must identify land area within the association's jurisdiction including but not limited to the
following:
a. Property to be transferred to public agencies;
b. The individual residential lots;
c. The common properties to be transferred by the developer to the property/homeowners
association; and
d. Other parcels.
9. Any governmental authority or agency, including, but not limited to, the City and the County,
their agents, and employees, shall have the right of immediate access to the common elements at
all times if necessary for the preservation of public health, safety and welfare. Should the
property/homeowners association fail to maintain the common elements to City specifications for an
unreasonable time, not to exceed ninety (90) days after written request to do so, then the City shall
have the same right, power and authority to enforce the association's rules and to levy assessments
necessary to maintain the common elements. The City may elect to exercise the rights and powers
of the property/homeowners association or its Board, or to take any action required and levy any
assessment that the property/homeowners association might have taken, either in the name of the
property/homeowners association or otherwise, to cover the cost of maintenance (or the possible
demolition, if such becomes necessary) of any common elements.
D. Protective Covenants. Protective covenants shall be developed which, among other things, shall make the
property/homeowners association responsible for:
1. The maintenance and operation of all common property;
2. The enforcement of all other covenants;
3. The administration of architectural controls (optional); and
4. Certain specified exterior maintenance of exterior improvements of individual properties
(optional).

guidelines for the naming of streets. Proposed street names shall be submitted for review along with (and as a
part of) the preliminary plat application, and shall become fixed at the time of approval of the preliminary plat.
On the final plat, street names shall not be changed from those that were approved on the preliminary plat
unless special circumstances have caused the major realignment of streets or a proposed street name(s) is
discovered to have already been used elsewhere in the City (or some other similar eventuality). If additional
street names are needed for the final plat, then they must be submitted for City staff review and approval along
with the final plat application. A fee may be established by the City for the changing of street names after
approval of the preliminary plat.
B. The City will maintain a list of existing street names (and “reserved” street names that have been
approved on a preliminary plat), and will update the list as new streets are platted.
C. New street names shall not duplicate existing street names either literally, or in a subtle manner (e.g.,
Smith Street vs. Smythe Street; Oak Drive vs. Oak Place vs. Oak Court vs. Oak Circle), shall not be so similar
as to cause confusion between names (e.g., Lakeside Drive vs. Lake Side Drive vs. Lake Siding Drive), and
shall not sound like existing street names when spoken (e.g., Oak Drive vs. Doak Drive; Lantern Way vs. Land
Tern Way).
D. New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Streets crossing
thoroughfares or other roadways shall bear the same name on both sides of the thoroughfare, wherever
practical.
E. The property owner shall provide payment for street name signs and other traffic-control signs as required
for the development. The cost of each street name sign installation shall include the cost of the sign assembly,
pole and the time for installation. Payment by the property owner will be due prior to approval of the engineering

sound, healthy, vigorous and growing condition, and they shall be of a size, fullness and height that are
customary for their container/ball size (as per the latest edition of the “American Standard for Nursery Stock,”
by the American Association of Nurserymen, as may be amended).
3. The design of the entryway shall be in accordance with design policies as provided by City staff. The
design of the entry shall be reflected on the engineering plans submitted with the preliminary plat, and shall be
approved by the City in conjunction with approval of the construction plans.
4. The maintenance of the entryway shall be the responsibility of the developer for a period of at least two (2)
years or until building permits have been issued for eighty percent (80%) of the lots in the subdivision,
whichever date is later. Following that period of time, maintenance responsibility shall be borne by the private
property owner(s) upon whose lot(s) the entryway feature is located, or by an approved homeowners
association (see Section 4.3). If, at some point in time, the maintenance responsibility shifts to the City, the City
shall have the right to upgrade, reduce or eliminate entirely, at its sole option, the landscaping and other
amenities in order to simplify and/or minimize the amount of time and effort that maintenance of the entryway
will require.

property line, and a box for the water meter(s) for each lot shall be installed immediately adjacent to the right-ofway
in an easement.
D. Services for utilities shall be made available to the property line of each lot in such a manner as will
minimize the necessity for disturbing the street pavement and drainage structure when connections are made.
The location of service lines shall be marked in accordance with the TCSS manual.
E. Fire hydrants shall be installed in residential areas every five hundred feet (500') of laying distance, and in
nonresidential areas every three hundred feet (300') of laying distance.
F. If the extension of service to a property is inside the City limits of Lufkin, the City will extend utility service
to the nearest property line that is the most advantageous to the City. The extension of service will be at no cost
to the owner/developer. Any upgrades in infrastructure will be completed by the City at no cost to the
owner/developer. All construction will be completed in accordance with the City Fire Code, TCEQ, and this
Subdivision Ordinance, whichever is more restrictive.
G. If the extension of service to a property for a subdivision or development requiring more than one (1)
meter is outside the City of Lufkin, the owner/developer will extend utility service to the property under the
supervision of City staff and based on construction plans approved by the City Engineer. All construction will be
in accordance with the City Fire Code, TCEQ, and this Subdivision Ordinance, whichever is more restrictive.
The cost of the extension of utility service will be borne solely by the owner/developer. Any upgrades in
infrastructure required to meet fire, pressure, and/or TCEQ rules will be completed by the owner/developer at

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 298/590
their expense. In the event of future connections to the utility service by other subdivisions or developers, the
original owner/developer will be reimbursed a prorated share based on a per unit cost for a period of up to five
(5) years. The cost shall be determined based on the point of connection of the new development. After five (5)
years, no cost will be reimbursed to the owner/developer.
H. If the extension of service to a property for an individual residence or meter is outside the City limits of
Lufkin, the City will extend utility service to the property for the first two hundred (200) feet at no cost to the
owner. The owner will be required to reimburse all material, labor, and administrative cost for all service beyond
the first two hundred (200) feet. Upgrade requirements will be the responsibility of the City.

A. An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets, pipes and other underground structures with
approved outlets shall be constructed where runoff of stormwater and the prevention of erosion cannot be
accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage facilities. Areas subject to flood conditions and/or inadvertent
stormwater retention (i.e., standing or pooling water), as established by the City, will not be considered for
development until adequate drainage has been provided.
B. The criteria for use in designing storm sewers, culverts, bridges, drainage channels, and drainage facilities
shall conform to the City of Lufkin's criteria in the TCSS Manual. In no case shall drainage areas be diverted
artificially to adjacent properties or across roadways.
C. The developer shall ensure that all drainage improvements within public easements or rights-of-way are
functioning properly prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond. The developer shall be responsible for
removing any significant build-up of sediment and/or trash from drainage improvements, with the exception of
back-lot and side-lot drainage swales, at the eleventh month of the year for the required one-year maintenance
bond for the applicable facilities. The City shall inspect the improvements to determine any maintenance or
correction of deficiencies at the conclusion of this period.

public improvements, as well as lot improvements (e.g., grading and installation of improvements required for
proper lot drainage and prevention of soil erosion, retaining walls, etc.) on the individual residential lots, are
properly constructed according to the approved engineering plans and to City standards, and until such public
improvements are dedicated to and accepted by the City. (Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised
through 1/4/2012)
Section 6.2: Guarantee of Public Improvement
A. Subdivider's Guarantee. Before approving the final plat of a subdivision located all or partially within the
City and/or the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the City Engineer must be satisfied that all public improvements
required shall have been constructed in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
B. Improvement Agreement and Guarantee. Based upon a recommendation by the City Engineer (or
designee), the Planning and Zoning Commission may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and
dedicate all public improvements prior to approval of the final plat, and may permit the property owner to enter
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 299/590
into an improvement agreement by which the property owner covenants to complete all required public
improvements no later than two (2) years following the date upon which the final plat is approved. The Planning
and Zoning Commission may also require the property owner to complete and dedicate some of the required
public improvements prior to approval of the final plat, and to enter into an improvement agreement for
completion of the remainder of the required improvements during such two-year period. The improvement
agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions as are agreed to by the property owner and the City.
Nothing within this section shall nullify the City's obligation to participate in the construction of oversize facilities
(pursuant to Ordinance No. ______, adopted on ____________, as may be amended).
C. Improvement Agreement Required for Oversize Reimbursement. The City shall require an improvement
agreement pertaining to any public improvement for which the developer shall request reimbursement from the
City for oversize costs. The City Manager shall authorize the approval of such agreement as meeting the
requirements of the City. The City Engineer is authorized to sign an improvement agreement on behalf of the
City.
D. Security. Whenever the City permits a property owner to enter into an improvement agreement, it shall
require the owner to provide sufficient security, covering the completion of the public improvements. The
security shall be in the form of cash escrow or, where authorized by the City, a letter of credit or other security
acceptable to the City Attorney, as security for the promises contained in the improvement agreement. In
addition to all other security, for completion of those public improvements where the City participates in the
cost, the owner shall provide a performance bond from the contractor, with the City as a co-obligee. Security
shall be in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated cost of completion (including
engineering design fees, contingencies, administrative costs, and other related costs) of the required public
improvements and lot improvements. The issuer of any surety bond and letter of credit shall be subject to the
approval of the City Attorney.
E. Letter of Credit. If the City Engineer authorizes the property owner to post a letter of credit as security for
its promises contained in the improvement agreement, the letter of credit shall:
1. Be irrevocable;
2. Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods, but in no
event less than one (1) year; and
3. Require only that the City present the issuer with a sight draft and a certificate signed by an
authorized representative of the City certifying to the City's right to draw funds under the letter of
credit.
F. As portions of the public improvements are completed in accordance with the TCSS Manual and the
approved engineering plans, the developer may make application to the City Engineer (or designee) to reduce
the amount of the original letter of credit. If the City Engineer (or designee) is satisfied that such portion of the
improvements has been completed in accordance with City standards, he may (but is not required to) cause the
amount of the letter of credit to be reduced by such amount that he deems appropriate, so that the remaining
amount of the letter of credit adequately insures the completion of the remaining public improvements.
G. Upon the dedication of and acceptance by the City of all required public improvements, the City shall
authorize a reduction in the security to 10% of the original amount of the security if the property owner is not in
breach of the improvement agreement. The remaining security shall be security for the owner's covenant to
maintain the required public improvements and to warrant that the improvements are free from defects for one
(1) year thereafter. If the required security for maintenance and warranty is otherwise provided by the
contractors or by others, the City will release the entire amount of the developer's security.

Section 6.3: Temporary Improvements
A. The property owner shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the City, and
shall maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by the City. Section 6.4: Government
Units [sic]
B. Governmental units to which these contract and security provisions apply may file, in lieu of the contract
and security, a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agents authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing

Section 6.4: Failure to Complete Improvements
A. For plats for which no improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been posted, if the
public improvements are not completed within the period specified by the City, the preliminary plat approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where an improvement agreement has been executed and
security has been posted, and the required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the
agreement, the City may:
1. Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the public improvements be installed
regardless of the extent of completion of the development at the time the agreement is declared to
be in default;
2. The final plat shall not be accepted for approval until the public improvements are completed;
3. Obtain funds under the security and complete the public improvements itself or through a third
party;
4. Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party, including a subsequent
owner of the subdivision for which public improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in
exchange for that subsequent owner's promise to complete the public improvements for the
subdivision;
5. Exercise any other rights available under the law.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 6.5: Acceptance of Dedication Offers
A. Acceptance of formal offers for the dedication of streets, public areas, easements and/or parks shall be by
authorization of the City Engineer (or designee). The approval by the City of a preliminary or final plat shall not,
in and of itself, be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the City of any street, public area,
easement or park shown on the plat. The City may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this
effect. (Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 6.6: Maintenance and Guarantee of Public Improvements
A. The owner shall maintain all required public improvements for a period of one (1) year following
acceptance of the subdivision by the City, and shall also provide a warranty that all public improvements will be

A. A permit is required from the City Engineer (or designee) prior to beginning any work in the City or its
extraterritorial jurisdiction that affects erosion control, public utilities, storm drainage, or a floodplain.
B. Preconstruction Conference. The City Engineer (or designee) may require that all contractors participating
in the construction meet for a preconstruction conference before any filling, excavation, clearing and/or removal
of vegetation and trees that are larger than eight inch (8") diameter.

3. All necessary off-site easements and/or dedications required for City-maintained facilities and
not shown on the final plat must be conveyed solely to the City (i.e., by separate instrument), with
the proper signatures affixed. The original of the documents and the appropriate filing fees (per the
City's submission guidelines, as may be amended from time to time) shall be returned to the City
Engineer prior to approval and release of the engineering plans;
4. All contractors participating in the construction shall be presented with a set of approved plans
bearing the stamp of release of the City Engineer (at least one set of these plans shall remain on the
job site at all times);
5. A complete list of the contractors, their representatives on the site, and telephone numbers
where a responsible party may be reached at all times must be submitted to the City Engineer; and
6. All applicable fees must be paid to the City.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 6.8: Inspection of Public Improvements
A. General Procedure. Construction inspection shall be supervised by the City Engineer. Construction shall
be in accordance with the approved engineering plans and the TCSS Manual of the City of Lufkin (and other
applicable codes and ordinances). Any change in design that is required during construction should be made by
the registered professional engineer whose seal and signature are shown on the plans. Another engineer may
make revisions to the original engineering plans if so authorized by the owner of the plans, and if those
revisions are noted on the plans or documents. All revisions shall be submitted to the City Engineer for
approval. If the City Engineer finds, upon inspection, that any of the required public improvements have not
been constructed in accordance with the City's standards and TCSS Manual, then the property owner shall be
responsible for completing and/or correcting the deficiencies such that they are brought into conformance with
the applicable standards.
B. Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The City will not accept dedication of required public improvements
until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the City Engineer, through submission of detailed “asbuilt,”
or record, drawings of the property which indicate all public improvements and their locations,
dimensions, materials and other information required by the City Engineer, and until all required public
improvements have been completed. The “as-builts” shall also include a complete set of record drawings of the
paving, drainage, water, sanitary sewer and/or other public improvements, showing that the layout of the lines
and grades of all public improvements are in accordance with construction plans for the plat, and showing all
changes made in the plans during construction, and containing on each sheet an “as-built” stamp bearing the
signature of the registered professional engineer and the date. One reproducible drawing of the utility plan
sheets containing the as-built information shall also be submitted. The engineer or surveyor shall also furnish
the City with a copy of the final plat and the engineering plans, if prepared on a CADD system, in such a digital
format (i.e., on disk) or by email that is compatible with the City's CADD system. When such requirements have
been met, the City Engineer shall issue a letter of acceptance to the developer.
1. Acceptance of the development shall mean that the developer has transferred all rights to all
the public improvements to the City for use and maintenance. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may, at its option, accept dedication of a portion of the required public improvements if the remaining
public improvements are not immediately required for health and safety reasons, and if the owner
has posted a performance bond, letter of credit or cash bond in the amount of one hundred percent
(100%) of the estimated cost of those remaining improvements for a length of time to be determined
by the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the remaining public improvements are greater than
$10,000.00 and are not completed within the determined length of time, the City will impose a ten
percent (10%) penalty of the performance bond, letter of credit, or cash bond. The obligation to
complete the improvements remains with the developer, and all future building permits or certificates
of occupancy will be withheld until the improvements are complete. If the remaining public
improvements are less than $10,000.00, the developer shall pay the actual dollar amount. The
length of time may be extended due to inclement weather or unforeseen delays by mutual
agreement between the developer and the City.
2. Upon acceptance of the required public improvements, the City Engineer shall submit a
certificate to the developer stating that all required public improvements have been satisfactorily
completed.

Section 6.9: Deferral of Required Improvements
A. The Planning and Zoning Commission may, upon petition of the property owner and favorable
recommendation of the City Engineer, defer at the time of final plat approval, subject to appropriate conditions,
the provision of any or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not required in the interests of the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. Whenever a petition to defer the construction of any public improvements required under this Ordinance is
granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the property owner shall deposit in escrow his share of the
costs (in accordance with City participation and oversizing policies) of the future public improvements with the
City prior to approval of the final plat, or the property owner may execute a separate improvement agreement
secured by a cash escrow or, where authorized, a letter of credit guaranteeing completion of the deferred public
improvements upon demand of the City.
(Ordinance 3693 adopted 4/6/2004, as revised through 1/4/2012)
Section 6.10: Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy
A. No building permit shall be issued for a lot or building site unless the lot or site has been officially recorded
by a final plat approved by the City of Lufkin, and unless all public improvements, as required by this Ordinance
for final plat approval, have been completed, except as permitted below:
1. Building permits may be issued for a nonresidential or multifamily (i.e., apartments)
development provided that a preliminary plat has been approved by the City, and construction plans
have been released by the City Engineer. However, building construction will not be allowed to
surpass the construction of fire protection improvements (i.e., the building shall not proceed above
the slab level until all required fire lanes have been completed, and until all water lines serving fire
hydrants have been completed, and inspected/tested).
2. The Building Official may release some residential building permits for a portion of a subdivision
(i.e., for not more than 10% of the new residential lots), provided that:
a. A preliminary plat has been approved by the City,
b. All public improvements have been completed for that portion of the development and
have been approved by the City Engineer, including, but not limited to, those required for fire
and emergency protection (i.e., streets including at least two points of access, alleys, water
lines serving fire hydrants, emergency access points, etc.).
3. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building or the use of property unless all
subdivision improvements have been completed and a final plat has been approved by the City and
recorded at the County. Notwithstanding the above, the Building Official and the City Engineer may
jointly authorize the conditional occupancy of a structure provided that an agreement providing cash
escrow, a letter of credit, or other sufficient surety is approved by the City for the completion of all
remaining public improvements, and provided that the structure is safely habitable in accordance
with the City's Building Codes.

Secs. 11.05.051–11.05.100 Reserved
Part II. Guidelines
Sec. 11.05.101 Purpose
(a) The growth, sustainability and diversity of a regional economy are goals that are critical to the long-term
prosperity of a community and its citizens. Communities must strategically plan and implement policies and
incentive programs to achieve these goals.
(b) These tax abatement guidelines (“guidelines”) demonstrate an effort by the city to help attract, retain and
expand targeted industries, increase employment and wages, expand the tax base, and create long-term
capital investment and new wealth opportunities in the community.
(c) The city council has adopted these guidelines and will utilize them to ensure that any abatement of
property taxes achieves the community's economic development goals.
(d) Chapter 312 of the Texas Tax Code authorizes local governments to abate ad valorem property taxes on
the value of new improvements to the property, including real property, tangible personal property, and
inventory and supplies. Taxing jurisdictions (e.g., the city and the county) are required by this statute to develop
and review guidelines at least every two years for the eligibility and award of this tax incentive.
(e) State law further requires that each taxing jurisdiction enter into a tax abatement agreement with each
owner of property or the owner of a leasehold interest in real property receiving an abatement or portion
thereof. These agreements are binding legal documents between all parties involved. Additional provisions and
requirements are included in those agreements.
(f) The city council has nominated land within the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction as an enterprise zone
(see enterprise zone map, attached to Resolution 4586 as exhibit A). The official enterprise zone, by such
designation, is automatically a reinvestment zone. These guidelines apply to property located in the city's
enterprise zone and persons or entities seeking tax abatement on property owned in the enterprise zone should
be aware that state law requires the governing bodies of all taxing jurisdictions in an enterprise zone to approve
a city tax abatement agreement on property located therein before the agreement can take effect.
(g) Within the city's enterprise zone, the city council has designated two revitalization areas (see exhibit A
attached to Resolution 4586) for particular attention: (1) Kurth Drive Revitalization Area and (2) Downtown
Revitalization Area. As incentives to invest in the revitalization of these areas, the minimum threshold eligibility
requirements for tax abatement require a smaller capital investment and fewer full-time jobs.
(Resolution 4502 adopted 2/5/2013; Resolution 4586 adopted 5/6/2014)
Sec. 11.05.102 Abatement authorized
(a) Reinvestment zone. To be eligible for tax abatement the owner must own taxable real property that is the
subject of the tax abatement within the city's enterprise zone and must enter into a written agreement with the
city, wherein the owner agrees to make specified improvements or repairs to the property in conformity with the
city's comprehensive plan.
(b) Authorized facility. A facility may be eligible for tax abatement if it is a manufacturing facility, research
facility, distribution center, service facility, or retail facility located in a designated revitalization area.
(c) Creation of new value. Tax abatement may only be granted for the additional value of eligible property
improvements made subsequent to and specified in a tax abatement agreement between the city and the
property owner, subject to such limitations as the city may require. The productive life of the improvements
must exceed 10 years.
(d) New and existing facilities. Tax abatement may be granted for new facility and improvements to existing
facility for purposes of modernization or expansion.
(Resolution 4502, sec. I, adopted 2/5/2013; Resolution 4586, sec. I, adopted 5/6/2014)

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 309/590
Sec. 11.05.103 Eligibility criteria
Under these guidelines, to be eligible for consideration for a tax abatement, a company or project must meet
and/or exceed all of the criteria, as described below:
(1) Eligible property. Tax abatement may only be granted to the owners of real property
improvements, personal property improvements, and taxable leasehold interests in tax-exempt real
property located in a reinvestment zone to the extent allowed by state law. Real property
improvements include the construction of a new facility and the expansion/modernization of an
existing facility. If a leased facility is granted tax abatement, the agreement shall be executed by
both the lessor and the lessee.
(2) Ineligible property. Any property that is not specifically identified in the tax abatement
agreement will not receive tax abatement. Inventory, supplies, and/or office equipment are not
eligible for tax abatement. Personal property that was located on the real property at any time before
the execution of the abatement agreement will not be eligible for abatement. Any property that is in a
tax increment financing zone will not be eligible for abatement.
(3) Abatement periods. Eligible real and/or personal property improvements may qualify for
abatement periods lasting between 2 to 10 years. The economic life of the eligible property must
exceed the abatement period.
(4) Exceptional cases. Where the applicant's investment in real and/or personal property
improvements substantially exceeds the eligibility thresholds, the city council may consider terms
and/or percentages that exceed these guidelines. However, the maximum period for any tax
abatement agreement is limited to 10 years in accordance with state law.
(5) Local hire requirement. Any project seeking a tax abatement must hire a minimum of 25% of
its new full-time employees at the project location from residents of the county, regardless of project
size. Residents, for the purpose of this policy, are those employees who reside in the county,
whether through relocation or existing residency.
(6) Employee health care benefits. The applicant seeking a tax abatement under these guidelines
must offer a health benefit plan to its full-time employees at a rate that is reasonable to the majority
of its employees and which allows access to the plan by the employees' dependents. For additional
consideration, the company may provide information on other employee benefits provided, such as
retirement/pension programs and subsidies for education, job-training, transportation assistance and
child/elderly care.
(7) Wage requirements. In order to be eligible for a tax abatement, all (100%) of the company's
new and existing employees at the project location must earn no less than 101% of the county
average salary for the type of industry throughout the full term of the tax abatement agreement.
(8) Companies and projects not eligible for tax abatement. These guidelines do not apply to
companies that sell products and/or services to the final consumer such as: restaurants, retail
stores, malls, hotels, motels, professional services, and similar facilities, unless located in a
designated revitalization area.
(9) Timing. In order to be eligible for consideration, the applicant must submit an application prior
to commencement of the project. No tax abatement for a proposed project will take effect until a final
negotiated agreement has been approved and fully executed. The timing and acquisition of personal
property related to this project will impact its eligibility for abatement.
(10) Additional terms and conditions. The applicant will enter into separate tax abatement
agreements with the city and the county and these agreements will require separate approval by
each governing authority. Consequently, each jurisdiction reserves the right to negotiate additional
terms and conditions on a case-by-case basis.
(11) Recapture of abated taxes. Tax abatement agreements will provide for recapture of abated
property taxes in the event contract terms and requirements are not met. These recapture provisions
will survive any subsequent assignment of the agreement.

Sec. 11.05.105 Application procedure
(a) Application submission. Applicants for tax abatement must submit a completed application for tax
abatement with the economic development corporation office. Incomplete applications will not be considered.
The economic development staff will review/verify the applicant's financial statements and request additional
information in determining the economic feasibility and long-term benefit of the overall project. Following this
review, the economic development corporation board will evaluate the application on the merit and value of the
proposed project. Based on the outcome of the evaluation, the economic development corporation may present
the application to the city council for consideration. Certain information provided by a property owner regarding
a request for tax abatement is considered confidential for a limited time period. The confidentiality of the
information continues until the tax abatement agreement is executed. This confidentiality may be waived by the
mutual consent of both the taxing unit and the property owner.
(b) City council consideration. All the projects brought to city council for consideration will be presented at
meetings conducted pursuant to the Open Meetings and Property Redevelopment and Tax Abatement Acts. A
public hearing must be held before the city council will approve an investment zone for tax abatement. If the
subject property is in an existing reinvestment zone, no public hearing is necessary. The city council retains
sole authority to approve or deny any tax abatement agreement and is under no obligation to approve any tax
abatement agreement.

city.
(b) City staff inspection. After receipt of an executed certificate of compliance, city staff shall make an
inspection to verify that all initial contract requirements are complete. Upon verification the city manager will
approve the certificate of compliance, authorize the commencement of the tax abatement, and notify the county
appraisal district.
(c) Annual certification. The owner must submit a statement, per the tax abatement agreement, that provides
information about the project's achievement during the prior year regarding the improvements and/or job
creation covered by the tax abatement agreement. The following items must be included in the statement:
(1) The added square footage and/or improvement value made;

(Ordinance 3519, ex. B, adopted 6/5/01; Ordinance 4131, ex. B, adopted 3/3/2009)
Sec. 11.05.154 Tax incentive policy statement
(a) General purpose and objectives.
(1) The city is committed to the promotion of high quality development in all parts of the city and to
an ongoing improvement in the quality of life for its citizens. The city is also committed to the
rehabilitation and revitalization of structures and areas of historic or economic importance, such as
the downtown area. These objectives are generally served by the enhancement, expansion, and
diversification of the local economy. The city council adopted a tax incentive policy on February 5,
2008 in cooperation with the Angelina College Tax District, Angelina County, Lufkin Independent
School District, Lufkin Angelina County Economic Development Partnership, and the Angelina
County Chamber of Commerce to assist in achieving these goals and objectives. The purpose of the
tax incentive policy is to promote the retention and expansion of existing industry and to assist in
attracting new business. According to state law, Property Redevelopment and Tax Abatement Act,
chapter 312, Tax Code, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes, and chapter 380 of the Local Government
Code, the city may grant tax abatement or provide incentives for economic development using
general fund revenues (the rebate of ad valorem taxes) on the increment in value added to a
particular property by a specific development proposal which meets the economic goals and
objectives of the city. The tax abatement or tax incentive may apply to any portion of the real
property or personal property value of the project. Tax incentives will not be ordinarily considered for
projects which would be developed without such incentives unless it can be demonstrated that
higher development standards or aesthetic improvements will be added, and/or other development
and community goals will be achieved through the use of the incentive. Tax incentives are granted to
the owners of improvements on real property. Projects which are developed involving leased real
property shall be governed under special terms and conditions which may be set forth in the
agreement governing each specific tax incentive.
(2) Within the context of these goals, the city will, on a case-by-case basis, give consideration to
providing incentives as a stimulus for economic development in the city. It is the policy of the city that
said consideration will be provided in accordance with the procedures and criteria outlined in this
document. Nothing herein shall imply or suggest that the city is under obligation to provide any
incentive to any applicant. Moreover, nothing herein shall limit the discretion of the city to decide
whether to enter into a specific tax-incentive agreement. All applicants shall be considered on a
case-by-case basis.
(b) Criteria for tax incentive.
(1) Any request for tax incentives shall be reviewed by the city, the county, Angelina College tax
district, and Lufkin Independent School District (where applicable by law), and except in the case of
an approved variance as discussed below, the proposed project must conform to the general
guidelines specified below:
(A) Any request for tax incentives must involve a development project that will add at least
ten (10) new full-time jobs and increase the current ad valorem value by an increment of at
least one million dollars ($1,000,000) under the “economic development” policy; or increase
the current ad valorem value by an increment of at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and
create five (5) new jobs under a downtown rehabilitation/revitalization policy or the Kurth Drive
revitalization policy.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 318/590
(B) The project must make a substantial contribution to development efforts in the city by
enhancing either additional development activity or furthering redevelopment and preservation
activities within special planning areas such as the downtown area or in a special development
zone of the city such as an enterprise zone.
(C) The project must be aesthetically pleasing and improve the outward appearance of the
property and area. Visual clutter must be screened in an appealing manner.
(D) The project must be a quality project and an asset to the community in economic
development, promotion of the city and area, and increasing good visual appearance of the
community.
(E) The project must be of a good, sound character that the city can be proud to have
located in the community. It shall not be of such a nature that it promotes activities not
traditionally accepted as moral or ethical.
(F) The project must remain in good standing with environmental regulations and not create
environmental concerns that are not readily addressable.
(G) The project is in an area which might not otherwise be developed because of decay in
area, shift in location trends away from the area, [or] some other reason that has caused
development to be slow in the area.
(H) The project has not been started and no construction has commenced at the time the
application is approved.
(I) The project cannot be a restaurant, retail establishment (wholesale and regional
distribution facilities are eligible), or offices or similar type of activity under policy A “Economic
Development” in subsection (c). However, such applications may be considered under both the
downtown rehabilitation/revitalization and the Kurth Drive revitalization policies. Competition
within the city should not be increased by the project. Any office project associated with a
regional (over several counties in area), state, national, or international headquarters (a
commanding center with several agencies, distribution points, etc. reporting to it) may be
considered if it meets all the criteria under all of the sections of this policy.
(2) Applications for tax incentives should provide a written narrative detailing how the project
relates to the criteria established above. Architect's drawings, elevations, and/or renderings may be
required to show how some standards will be met. These drawings, elevations, and/or renderings
would need to be accurate in color, facade changes, and landscaping plans.
(c) Objective criteria for determining tax incentive and value of incentives. The subjective criteria outlined in
subsection (b) will be used to determine if it is in the best interests of the city, the county, Lufkin Independent
School District (where applicable) and Angelina College to provide tax incentives to a particular applicant. To
determine the amount abated or rebated on any increment in value added to the current ad valorem value of
property, the following objective criteria must be met except in the case of an approved variance, as discussed
below). There are two (2) policies which an applicant may consider. The applicant needs to apply for the policy
which is most appropriate. The city council retains the right to make the final decision of the appropriateness of
the policy chosen based upon the scope of the project and the intent of the policies. The objective criteria
policies are as follows:
(1) Policy A (economic development).
(A) Objective requirements.
(i) Minimum project requirements for consideration of incentives:

Sec. 11.05.251 Findings
After reviewing all information before it regarding the establishment of the zone and after conducting the public
hearing and affording a reasonable opportunity for all interested persons to speak and present evidence for or
against the creation of the zone, the city council hereby makes the following findings of fact:
(1) The statements and facts set forth in the recitals of the ordinance from which this part derives
are true and correct. Therefore, the city has met the notice and procedural requirements established
by the code for creation of a reinvestment zone under chapter 312 of the Texas Tax Code.
(2) The improvements proposed for the zone, as more specifically outlined in the public hearing,
are feasible and practical and, once completed, will benefit the land included in the zone as well as
the city for a period in excess of ten (10) years, which is the statutory maximum term of any tax
abatement agreement entered into under chapter 312 of the Texas Tax Code.
(3) As a result of designation as a reinvestment zone, the area within the zone is reasonably likely
to contribute to the expansion of primary employment and to attract major investment in the zone
that will be a benefit to property in the zone and will contribute to the economic development of the
city.
Sec. 11.05.252 Designation
The city council hereby designates the zone described in the boundary description included herein in section
11.05.254 as a reinvestment zone for purposes of granting a business expansion tax abatement, as authorized
by and in accordance with chapter 312 of the Texas Tax Code. This zone shall be known as “Tax Abatement
Reinvestment Zone Number One, City of Lufkin, Texas.” This project is eligible for a tax abatement pursuant to
the tax abatement guidelines.
Sec. 11.05.253 Term
The zone shall take effect upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this part derives and expire five
(5) years thereafter. The zone may be renewed by the city council for one or more subsequent terms of five (5)
years or less.

Sec. 12.04.042 Findings
The city council finds and determines that a vehicle that proceeds into an intersection when the traffic-control
signal controlling that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal damages the public by
endangering motor vehicle operators and pedestrians alike, by decreasing the efficiency of traffic-control and
traffic flow efforts, and by increasing the number of serious accidents to which public safety agencies must
respond at the expense of taxpayers. (1995 Code, sec. 76.02; Ordinance 427 adopted 1/2/2007; Ordinance
4007 adopted 8/21/2007)
Sec. 12.04.043 Notice of violation
(a) The department shall be responsible for the enforcement and administration of this division.
(b) In order to impose a civil penalty under this division, the department shall mail a notice of violation to the
owner of the motor vehicle not later than the thirtieth day after the date the violation is alleged to have occurred
to:
(1) The owner's address as shown on the registration records of the state department of
transportation or the state department of public safety; or
(2) If the vehicle is registered in another state or country, the owner's address as shown on the
motor vehicle registration records of the department or agency of the other state or country
analogous to the state department of transportation or department of public safety.

(1995 Code, sec. 76.03; Ordinance 427 adopted 1/2/2007; Ordinance 4007 adopted 8/21/2007)
Sec. 12.04.044 Administrative adjudication hearing
(a) A person who receives a notice of violation may contest the imposition of the civil penalty by requesting in
writing an administrative adjudication of the civil penalty within 30 days after receipt of the notice of violation.
Upon receipt of a timely request, the department shall notify the person of the date and time of the hearing on
the administrative adjudication. The administrative adjudication hearing shall be held before a hearing officer
appointed by the city council.
(b) Failure to pay a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability in the full
amount of the civil penalty assessed in the notice of violation, and is a waiver of the right to appeal under this
section.
(c) The civil penalty shall not be assessed if, after a hearing, the hearing officer enters a finding of no liability.
(d) In an administrative adjudication hearing, the issues must be proved at the hearing by a preponderance
of the evidence. The reliability of the photographic traffic signal enforcement system used to produce the
recorded image of the violation may be attested to in an administrative adjudication hearing by affidavit of an
officer or employee of the city or the entity with which the city contracts to install or operate the system and who
is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. An affidavit of an officer or employee of the city that
alleges a violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded image is admissible in a proceeding under
this division and is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit.
(e) A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing or who requests an
administrative adjudication hearing and thereafter fails to appear at the time and place of the hearing is liable
for administrative hearing costs in the amount provided in the fee schedule in addition to the amount of the civil
penalty assessed for the violation. A person who is found liable for a civil penalty after an administrative
adjudication hearing shall pay the civil penalty and costs within ten days of the hearing.
(f) It is presumed that the owner of the motor vehicle committed the violation alleged in the notice of violation
mailed to the person if the motor vehicle depicted in a photograph or a digital image taken by a photographic
traffic signal enforcement system belongs to the owner of the motor vehicle, except it shall be an affirmative
defense to the imposition of civil liability under this division, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence,
that:
(1) The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to an ordinarily
observant person;
(2) The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of
a police officer;
(3) The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the traffic-control signal so as to
yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle;
(4) The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle under Tex. Transp.
Code, chapter 546, and that the operator was acting in compliance with that chapter;
(5) The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner
of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner;
(6) The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being
displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued;
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 334/590
(7) The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road
conditions existed that would make compliance with this division and with the traffic-control signal
more dangerous under the circumstances than noncompliance;
(8) The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor vehicle at the
time of the violation; or
(9) The motor vehicle depicted in a photograph or a digital image taken by a photographic traffic
signal enforcement system was owned by a person in the business of selling, renting, or leasing
motor vehicles or by a person who was not the person named in the notice of violation, when the
owner presents evidence establishing that the vehicle was at that time:
(A) Being test driven by another person;
(B) Being rented or leased by the vehicle's owner to another person; or
(C) Owned by a person who was not the person named in the notice of violation;
provided testimony at the administrative adjudication hearing or a written declaration
under penalty of perjury is submitted to the local authority by affidavit or written
declaration.
(g) To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate
displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit proof acceptable to the hearing
officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement
agency.
(h) Notwithstanding anything in this division to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil
liability in a timely manner is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation if:
(1) The person files an affidavit with the hearing officer stating the date on which the person
received the notice of violation that was mailed to the person; and
(2) Within the same period required by this section for a hearing to be timely requested, but
measured from the date the mailed notice was received as stated in the affidavit, the person
requests an administrative adjudication hearing.
(i) A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing may appeal that finding of civil
liability to the municipal court of the city by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the municipal court. The
notice of appeal must be filed not later than the thirty-first day after the date on which the administrative
adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of civil liability. Unless the person, on or before the filing of the
notice of appeal, posts a bond in the total amount of the penalty, fees and costs, an appeal does not stay the
enforcement of the civil penalty. An appeal shall be determined by the municipal court by trial de novo. Any
affidavits submitted at the administrative adjudication hearing to establish the reliability of the photographic
traffic signal enforcement system shall be admitted by the municipal judge in the trial de novo, and the facts
must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. A person found liable by the municipal court shall pay an
appellate filing fee as provided in the fee schedule in addition to the civil penalty and any other costs and fees
due the city.

(a) Timed parking violations. Any person failing to comply with established time limits for the area in which
his/her vehicle is parked shall be subject to a citation resulting in a $5.00 fine for the first violation, $10.00 for
the second violation, and $25.00 for the third and all others thereafter issued in a single 24-hour period.
Citations shall be issued by the parking attendant, as designated by the chief of police, between the hours of
7:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday except for holidays. The parking attendant shall vary his/her
routine to prevent deliberate circumvention of the city's parking policies.

(a) All recycling containers are the property of the city. It is the resident's or the business's responsibility to
keep these containers clean and free of contamination.
(b) Inspections are conducted at random on residential customers through the “red tag” program. City
employees will randomly select a particular route to inspect. Inspectors will be looking inside the blue curbside
containers for contaminates that will spoil recyclables, such as food, diapers, household trash or any other item
that is not acceptable inside the blue curbside container. If contamination exists, the container will be red
tagged and will not be emptied. After a customer has been “red tagged” three times, their cart will be picked up
and after 30 days the customer may request it back after signing an agreement with the recycling coordinator.
Businesses who have dumpsters may also be “red tagged” for contamination. If a dumpster contains any item
except recyclable materials, the city has the authority to deny service to that dumpster. The customer will be
asked to either remove the contamination to allow the dumpster to be emptied, or pay a service charge as
provided in the fee schedule to have the dumpster emptied by the city's garbage collection service.
(c) It is understandable that residents or businesses that make an effort to recycle correctly may sometimes
make a mistake and place unacceptable items in with their recyclables. In this case, during the inspection
process, the containers will be given a tag to remind the resident to be more careful when placing items in the
blue containers. The containers will be emptied as long as the contamination is not too severe.
(d) The purpose of the inspection process is to help educate citizens and to decrease the contamination rate.

(a) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into
the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification
of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharge during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream discharge during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications
must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection
(a) need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under section 13.05.155. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the selfmonitoring
requirements of sections 13.05.151, 13.05.153, and 13.05.154.
(b) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection(a) above during a calendar month in which
they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous
wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d)
and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges less than
such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.

hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city
manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place
to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be
discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Division 9. Administrative Enforcement Remedies
Sec. 13.05.251 Notice of violation
When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the city manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ordinance 3064 adopted 9/20/1994; 1995 Code,
sec. 51.115; Ordinance 3912 adopted 11/7/2006)
Sec. 13.05.252 Consent orders
The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by
the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to sections 13.05.254 and 13.05.255 and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ordinance 3064 adopted
9/20/1994; 1995 Code, sec. 51.116; Ordinance 3912 adopted 11/7/2006)
Sec. 13.05.253 Show cause hearing
The city manager may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the city manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ordinance 3064 adopted 9/20/1994; 1995 Code, sec. 51.117;
Ordinance 3912 adopted 11/7/2006)
Sec. 13.05.254 Compliance order
When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the

amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability
for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, talking any other action against the user. In lieu of an accompanying fine, the city may also
allow/require the IU to construct the necessary equipment and implement the appropriate pollution prevention
practice, as part of the required corrective action. (Ordinance 3064 adopted 9/20/1994; 1995 Code, sec.
51.118; Ordinance 3912 adopted 11/7/2006)
Sec. 13.05.255 Cease and desist orders
(a) When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article,
a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it
to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address
a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(b) Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

Sec. 13.05.256 Administrative fines
(a) When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article,
a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the city manager may fine such a user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines may be assessed on
a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines may be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(b) Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 15 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of
10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A lien against the
user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(c) Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine
along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the city manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the
payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city manager may add
the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(d) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
(e) In lieu of paying a fine, the city may allow the IU to install the necessary equipment and/or implement an
appropriate pollution prevention practice, as part of the required corrective action.

Sec. 13.05.257 Emergency suspension of discharge
(a) The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user,
whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city
manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that
threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 423/590
order, the city manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city manager that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 13.05.258 are initiated
against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any further occurrence, to the city manager, prior to
the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 13.05.253 or 13.05.258.
(b) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension
under this section.

to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and
characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring,
or sampling: or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article.
(b) Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to
show cause under section 13.05.253 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the city manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
city manager may petition the district court of the county through the city attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The
city manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ordinance 3064 adopted 9/20/1994; 1995
Code, sec. 51.130; Ordinance 3912 adopted 11/7/2006)
Sec. 13.05.282 Remedies nonexclusive
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The city manager may take any, all or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally
be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city manager may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city manager is empowered to take more than

Division 12. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
Sec. 13.05.351 Events beyond user's control
(a) If an event that would otherwise be a violation of a permit is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike,
riot, or other catastrophe, and therefore is beyond the user's control, the event is not a violation of that permit in
an action brought in municipal or state court.
(b) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of an event beyond the user's control shall
demonstrate the following through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or the relevant evidence:
(1) An event of the type described in subsection (a) above occurred;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in

control only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(e) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where,
among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

general prohibitions in section 13.05.031(a) or the specific prohibitions in section 13.05.031(b)(3) through (b)(7)
if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
(1) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharge and the user was in compliance with each limit
directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or
(2) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents
from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its TPDES permit and,
in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

Sec. 13.05.353 Bypass
(a) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
Bypass. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
Severe property damage. Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which
causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b) Any user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to
be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c) (1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city
manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration
of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and

prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city manager may waive the written report on a case-bycase
basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(d) (1) Bypass is prohibited, and the city manager may take an enforcement action against a
user for a bypass, unless:
(A) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property
damage;
(B) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(C) The user submitted notice as required under subsection (c) of this section.
(2) The city manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if
the city manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this
section.

ARTICLE 13.07 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION*
Sec. 13.07.001 Definitions
Approved. Approved by the authority responsible as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this
article or as suitable for the proposed use.
Auxiliary water supply. Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved
public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water
supply or any natural source(s), such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, and so forth; used waters; or
industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted, or they may be objectionable and constitute an
unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
Backflow. The undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system as a result of a crossconnection.
Backflow preventer. An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.
(1) Air gap. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest
opening from any pipe or faucet conveying water or waste to a tank, plumbing fixture, receptor, or
other assembly and the flood level rim of the receptacle. These vertical physical separations must be
at least twice the diameter of the water supply outlet, and never less than one inch (25 mm).
(2) Reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly. The approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly consists of two independently acting approved check valves together
with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located
between the check valves and below the first check valve. These units are located between two
tightly closing resilient-seated shut-off valves as an assembly and equipped with properly located
resilient-seated test cocks.
(3) Double check valve assembly. The approved double check valve assembly consists of two
internally loaded check valves, either spring loaded or internally weighted, installed as a unit
between two tightly closing resilient-seated shut-off valves and fittings with properly located resilientseated
test cocks. This assembly shall only be used to protect against a non-health hazard (that is, a
pollutant).
Backpressure. A pressure, higher than the supply pressure, caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or any
other means that may cause backflow.
Backsiphonage. Backflow caused by negative or reduced pressure in the supply piping.
Contamination. An impairment of a potable water supply by the introduction or admission of any foreign
substance that degrades the quality and creates a health hazard.
Cross-connection. A connection or potential connection between any part of a potable water system and any
other environment containing other substances in a manner that, under any circumstances, would allow such
substances to enter the potable water system. Other substances may be gases, liquids, or solids, such as
chemicals, waste products, steam, water from other sources (potable or nonpotable), or any matter that may
change the color or add odor to the water.
Cross-connection control by containment. The installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly at the
water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically unfeasible to find
and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's water
system, or the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service line leading to and
supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections that
cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection.
Cross-connection - controlled. A connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system
with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously
afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 435/590
Designee. The water utilities superintendent of the public works division of the city is the designated official as
assigned by the city engineer who is vested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an
effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this article.
Hazard, degree of. The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse
effect of the hazard upon the potable water system.
Hazard - health. A cross-connection or potential cross-connection involving any substance that could, if
introduced in the potable water supply, cause death or illness, spread disease, or have a high probability of
causing such effects.
Hazard - non-health. A cross-connection or potential cross-connection involving any substance that generally
would not be a health hazard but would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable if introduced into
the potable water supply.
Hazard - plumbing. A plumbing-type cross-connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been
properly protected by an approved air gap or an approved backflow prevention assembly.
Hazard - system. An actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable
water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination that would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
Industrial fluids system. Any system containing a fluid or solution that may be chemically, biologically, or
otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system,
pollution, or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but shall not be
limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the
public potable water system that may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids
and alkalies; circulating cooling waters connected to an open cooling tower, and/or cooling towers that are
chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters, such as
wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, and so forth; and oils, gases,
glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions, and other liquid components and gaseous fluids used in
industrial or other purposes or for firefighting purposes.
Pollution. The presence of any foreign substance in water that tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a
non-health hazard or impair the usefulness of the water.
Service connection. The terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, that is,
where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the
customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service
connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected take-offs from the
service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to the
customer's water system. “Service connection” shall also include a water service connection from a fire hydrant
and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.
Water - nonpotable. Water that is not safe for human consumption or that is of questionable quality.
Water - potable. Water that is safe for human consumption as described by the public health authority having
jurisdiction.
Water - used. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's
water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the
water purveyor.
(1995 Code, sec. 52.26; Ordinance 3370 adopted 2/10/1999)
Sec. 13.07.002 Penalty
Users of the city water, except for the city, who do not comply with this article shall be subject to a penalty and
fine of not more than $500.00 per day for each day of noncompliance and/or disconnection or discontinuance of
water services to such users by the city. (1972 Code, sec. 26-4(d); 1995 Code, sec. 52.99(A))

The purpose of this article is:
(1) To protect the public potable water supply of the city from the possibility of contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer's internal distribution system(s) or the customer's private
water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the public water system;
(2) To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential,
between the customer's in-plant potable water system(s) and nonpotable water systems, plumbing
fixtures, and industrial piping systems;
(3) To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control that will
systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
(1995 Code, sec. 52.25(A)(1)–(3); Ordinance 3370 adopted 2/10/1999)
Sec. 13.07.004 Responsibility and authority of city engineer
The city engineer or his/her designee shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water
distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through
the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the city engineer or his/her designee, an approved backflow
prevention assembly is required (at the customer's water service connection, or within the customer's private
water system) for the safety of the water system, the city engineer or his/her designated agent shall give notice
in writing to said customer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at specific locations(s)
on his/her premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved assembly(s) at his/her own
expense, and failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested, and maintain said
assembly(s) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements
have been satisfactorily met. (1995 Code, sec. 52.25(B); Ordinance 3370 adopted 2/10/1999)
Sec. 13.07.005 Components of water system
(a) The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the utility system and the customer
system.
(b) The utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system, and shall include all
those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the customer's
system begins.
(c) The source shall include all of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of
water to the distribution system.
(d) The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the
source to the customer's system.
(e) The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the utility
distribution system that are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
(1995 Code, sec. 52.27(A); Ordinance 3370 adopted 2/10/1999)
Sec. 13.07.006 Backflow prevention requirements
(a) No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor
unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this article. Service of water
to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this
article is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been
removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be
restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
(b) The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized
representatives of the city to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards,
including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the city engineer or his
designee shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 437/590
service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state and city statutes relating
to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
(c) An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water
system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served, but in all cases before the
first branch line leading off the service, wherever the following conditions exist:
(1) In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe
bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the city
engineer or his/her designee, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the
premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to
the degree of hazard.
(2) In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances
are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system,
the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall
include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been
subject to deterioration in quality.
(3) In the case of premises having (i) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently
corrected and controlled, or (ii) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all
portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system
shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention
assembly in the service line.
(d) The type of protective assembly required under subsections (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section shall
depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows:
(1) In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection
(c)(1) and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by
an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly.
(2) In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but
not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved double check valve assembly.
(3) In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in
such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water
system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist
include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants,
hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants.
(4) In the case of any premises where there are “uncontrolled” cross-connections, either actual or
potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an
approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
(5) In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or
restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved
air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on
each service to the premises.
(6) In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the city engineer or his/her designee, an
undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the city
engineer or his/her designee may require an air gap at the service connection to protect the public
water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the city engineer or his/her designee and
is dependent on the degree of hazard.

by the city engineer or his/her designee. The term “approved backflow prevention assembly” shall
mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established
by the American Water Works Association titled AWWA C510-89 (Standard for Double Check Valve
Backflow Prevention Assembly) and AWWA C511-89 (Standard for Reduced Pressure Principle
Backflow Prevention Assembly), and has met completely the laboratory and field performance
specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the
University of Southern California established by “Specification of Backflow Prevention Assemblies,”
section 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control. Said AWWA and
FCCHR standards and specifications have been adopted by the city engineer or his/her designee.
Final approval shall be evidenced by a “certificate of approval” issued by an approved testing
laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA standards and FCCHR specifications.
(2) The following testing laboratory has been qualified by the city engineer or his/her designee to
test and certify backflow preventers:
Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research
University of Southern California
University Park
Los Angeles, CA 90089
(3) Testing laboratories other than the laboratory listed above will be added to an approved list as
they are qualified by the (water commissioner or health officer).
(4) Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been
fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed
on the laboratory's current list of approved backflow prevention assemblies may be used without
further testing or qualification.
(f) It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are
installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances
where the city engineer or his/her designee deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be
required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and
shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, the city engineer or his/her designee
personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the city engineer or his/her designee. It shall be the duty of the
city engineer or his/her designee to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall
notify the city engineer or his/her designee in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the
customer-user may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced
at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such
tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the city engineer or his/her designee.
(g) All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section,
but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time if installation and that have been
properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (f), be
excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the city engineer or his/her designee is assured that
they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present
location, or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the city engineer or his/her designee finds that
the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention
assembly meeting the requirements of this section.
(h) This ordinance consists of the following exhibits: table 1 (guide to the assessment of hazard and selection
of assemblies for internal protection), table 2 (guide to the assessment of hazard and selection of assemblies
for premises isolation), and figures 1–6 (class of fire protection systems). These exhibits are provided as a
guide for selection of type of backflow prevention device which may be required.

household increases so as to place the customer in a different allocation category, the
customer may notify the city on the form and the change will be implemented in the next
practicable billing period. If the number of persons in a household is reduced, the
customer shall notify the city in writing within two days. In prescribing the method for
claiming more than two persons per household, the city manager shall adopt methods to
insure the accuracy of the claim. Any person who knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal
negligence falsely reports the number of persons in a household or fails to timely notify
the city of a reduction in the number of persons in a household shall be fined not less
than $1,000.00.
(B) Residential water customers shall pay the surcharges provided in the fee schedule. The
surcharge shall be cumulative.
(2) Master-metered multifamily residential customers.
(A) The allocation to a customer billed from a master meter which jointly measures water to
multiple permanent residential dwelling units (e.g., apartments, mobile homes) shall be
allocated 6,000 gallons per month for each dwelling unit. It shall be assumed that a customer's
meter serves two dwelling units unless the customer notifies the city of a greater number on a
form prescribed by the city manager. The city manager shall give his/her best effort to see that
forms are mailed, otherwise provided, or made available to every customer. If, however, a
customer does not receive a form, it shall be the customer's responsibility to go to the city
offices to complete and sign the form claiming more than two dwellings. A dwelling unit may be
claimed under this provision whether it is occupied or not. New customers may claim more
dwelling units at the time of applying for water service on the form prescribed by the city
manager. If the number of dwelling units served by a master meter is reduced, the customer
shall notify the city in writing within two days. In prescribing the method for claiming more than
two dwelling units, the city manager shall adopt methods to insure the accuracy of the claim.
Any person who knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence falsely reports the number of
dwelling units served by a master meter or fails to timely notify the city of a reduction in the
number of persons in a household shall be fined not less than $2,000.00.
(B) Customers billed from a master meter under this provision shall pay the monthly
surcharges provided in the fee schedule. Surcharges shall be cumulative.
(3) Commercial customers.
(A) A monthly water usage allocation shall be established by the city manager, or his/her
designee, for each nonresidential commercial customer other than an industrial customer who
uses water for processing purposes. The nonresidential customer's allocation shall be
approximately 75% of the customer's usage for corresponding month's billing period for the
previous 12 months. If the customer's billing history is shorter than 12 months, the monthly
average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for
which no history exists. The city manager shall give his/her best effort to see that notice of
each nonresidential customer's allocation is mailed to the customer. If, however, a customer
does not receive the notice, it shall be the customer's responsibility to contact the city to
determine the allocation. Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city manager,
the allocation may be reduced or increased if:
(i) The designated period does not accurately reflect the customer's normal water
usage;
(ii) One nonresidential customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another
nonresidential customer; or
(iii) Other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate
under present conditions.
A customer may appeal an allocation established hereunder to the city council.

(B) Nonresidential commercial customers shall pay the surcharges provided in the fee
schedule. The surcharges shall be cumulative.
(4) Industrial customers.
(A) A monthly water usage allocation shall be established by the city manager, or his/her
designee, for each industrial customer which uses water for processing purposes. The
industrial customer's allocation shall be approximately 85% of the customer's water usage
baseline. Ninety days after the initial imposition of the allocation for industrial customers, the
industrial customer's allocation shall be further reduced to 80% of the customer's water usage
baseline. The industrial customer's water usage baseline will be computed on the average
water usage for the 12-month period ending prior to the date of implementation of Stage 2 of
the plan. If the industrial water customer's billing history is shorter than 12 months, the monthly
average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for
which no billing history exists. The city manager shall give his/her best effort to see that notice
of each industrial customer's allocation is mailed to the customer. If, however, a customer does
not receive the notice, it shall be the customer's responsibility to contact the city to determine
the allocation, and the allocation shall be fully effective notwithstanding the lack of receipt of
written notice. Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city manager, the
allocation may be reduced or increased if:
(i) The designated period does not accurately reflect the customer's normal water
usage because the customer had shut down a major processing unit for repair or
overhaul during the period;
(ii) The customer has added or is in the process of adding significant additional
processing capacity;
(iii) The customer has shut down or significantly reduced the production of a major
processing unit;
(iv) The customer has previously implemented significant permanent water
conservation measures such that the ability to further reduce usage is limited;
(v) The customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another industrial customer;
or
(vi) Other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate
under present conditions.
A customer may appeal an allocation established hereunder to the city council.
(B) Industrial customers shall pay the surcharges provided in the fee schedule. The
surcharges shall be cumulative.

wholesale customer shall be limited to the allocation established for each month.
(2) A water usage allocation shall be established by the city manager, or his/her designee, for
each wholesale customer. The wholesale customer's water usage for each drought response stage
will be computed based on a percentage of the maximum daily water usage as identified in the
customer's water supply contract with the city. The water available to wholesale customers will be
reduced by the percent of desired water reduction as listed in each drought response stage, section
13.08.035.
(3) The city manager shall provide notice, by certified mail, to each wholesale customer informing
them of their water usage allocations for each drought response stage and shall notify the news
media and the executive director of the state commission on environmental quality upon initiation of
pro rata water allocation.
(4) Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city manager, the allocation may be
reduced or increased if:
(A) The designated period does not accurately reflect the wholesale customer's normal
water usage;
(B) The customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another wholesale customer; or
(C) Other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate
under present conditions.
A customer may appeal an allocation established hereunder to the city council.

Agricultural District is also appropriate for areas where development is premature due to lack of utilities or City
services; to preserve areas that are unsuitable for development due to problems that may present hazards such
as flooding, in which case the “AG” zoning designation should be retained until such hazards are mitigated and
the land is rezoned and to provide permanent open space areas as buffers around uses that might otherwise
be objectionable or pose environmental health hazards.

between the street and the leading edge of any building or in the landscape buffer area. Diameter
measurements shall be taken six inches (6") above grade.
D. Landscaping may be moved in order to accommodate utility or drainage easements when a request for

SECTION 7 SCREENING
A. A solid fence that completely obscures the view of the adjoining property (at a minimum height of six feet
(6')) shall be employed and maintained within three feet (3') of side and rear property lines in which a
nonresidential use abuts any residential zoning district or use.
Fence composition is limited to materials routinely used in fence construction, i.e. wooden picket, brick, stone,
pipe, concrete or other materials, that will completely obscure views. The use of a wooden picket privacy fence
is acceptable provided that the fence completely obscures the view of commercial activities and that permanent
provisions for the maintenance of the fence are provided. Fences composed of materials that are normally not
associated with a fence such as used tires, car parts, or other non-standard new or used materials are
prohibited in all zoning districts.
1. If adjacent owners prefer that no fence be placed between abutting properties they must submit
a letter (stating their preference) to the Director of Planning. This information shall serve as a waiver
of the requirement for a fence. On sites adjacent to multiple neighbors the request must be
unanimous in support of the waiver. The requirement for construction of a fence may be reviewed by
the Board of Adjustments and Appeals as a variance.
B. Fence height measurements are taken at the mean (average) grade height.
C. Fences used for screening may be reduced to a height of four feet (4") between the setback line and
property line at the discretion of the Director of Planning when the Director of Planning determines the reduction
is beneficial to the adjacent uses.
D. All refuse collection containers shall comply with the City of Lufkin Technical Specifications and
Construction Standards.

for a greater front yard than required by this Ordinance, no building shall be erected closer to the right-of-way
than provided for by the recorded plat.
C. Open and unenclosed terraces or porches and eaves and roof extensions may project into the required
front yard for a distance not to exceed four (4) feet; provided however, that no supporting structure for such
extensions or other structure may be located within the required front yard. An unenclosed canopy for a
gasoline service station or similar business may extend into the required front yard but shall never be closer
than twelve (12) feet from the street right-of-way.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)

upon a lot or unplatted tract. Every dwelling shall front and face a street or officially approved place. Whenever
two or more single-family or two-family dwellings are placed upon a single lot or tract; or a main building will not
face a street or officially approved place, the same may be permitted when a site plan is approved in a manner
established by applicable ordinance.
Where a lot is used for multiple-family dwellings, retail, commercial or industrial purposes or any combination of
these uses, more than one (1) main building may be located on the lot, but only when such buildings conform to

separate utilities, be used for commercial purposes or utilized by individuals other than the principal building's
residents.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010; Ordinance 4404, sec. I, adopted
2/7/2012)
5. FENCES, WALLS AND SIMILAR BARRIERS
No fence, wall or similar barrier may be located within a street right-of-way.
A fence, wall or similar barrier not exceeding three and one-half (3-1/2) feet in height may be located within the
required front yard, provided however, that it shall be placed no closer than ten (10) feet from the street (either
back of curb or pavement edge). The height of the fence, wall or similar barrier may be extended to a maximum
of eight (8) feet on corner lots serving as an entryway to a subdivision, provided that no primary entrance to a
main structure on the lot shall face towards the fence, wall or similar barrier.
When no front yard is required by the applicable zoning district, the building line established by the wall of a
main structure closest to the street right-of-way shall substitute as the required front yard for the purpose of this
subsection. However, when an opaque screening device is required along side or rear lot lines, the screening
device shall be extended to the required front yard of the adjoining property.
Fences, walls and similar barriers may be erected along side and rear property lines.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 540/590
Any junkyard, whether a primary use or an accessory use, shall provide an opaque screening device of a
uniform height (minimum six feet and maximum ten feet) in relation to the ground that screens the view from
adjoining lots and/or public places from junk. Stacking of junk which allows visibility from an adjoining lot or
public place shall be prohibited. (Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
4. AUTOMOBILE SALES
All vehicles shall be displayed only on an impervious paved surface. A physical barrier shall be placed along
the property line to prevent the vehicles from encroaching into the street right-of-way. This provision shall apply
equally to sales lots for boats, recreational vehicles and trailers or other similar vehicles. (Ordinance 3368
adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
5. MULTIPLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS
There shall be a minimum distance of thirty (30) feet between multiple-family structures. Balconies, eaves or

(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
8. SCREENING
In the “RPO” - Restrictive Professional Office, “NR” - Neighborhood Retail, “LB” - Local Business, “C” -
Commercial, “CB” - Central Business, “HM” - Heavy Manufacturing and “LM” - Light Manufacturing districts, a
solid fence that completely obscures the view of the adjoining property (to a minimum height of six (6) feet)
shall be employed and maintained within three feet of side and rear lot lines in which a nonresidential use abuts
any residential zoning district.
Fence composition is limited to materials routinely used in fence construction, i.e. wooden picket, brick, stone,
pipe, concrete or other materials, that will completely obscure views. The use of a wooden picket privacy fence
is acceptable provided that the fence completely obscures the view of commercial activities and that permanent
provisions for the maintenance of the fence are provided. Fences composed of materials that are normally not
associated with a fence such as used tires, car parts or other non-standard new or used materials are
prohibited in all zoning districts.
In those circumstances where construction of a fence is not desired (by owners of land adjacent to a
nonresidential property or by the owners of the developing land) the Planning and Zoning Commission may
consider and approve or deny a request to waive the fence installation requirement. In the case where
neighboring residential properties are in opposition to the proposed waiver, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider protection of interests of those neighboring residential property owners a priority.
The determination of the Planning and Zoning Commission may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment and
Appeals.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
9. LANDSCAPE AND TREE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS
SECTION 1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this Ordinance is to enhance the beautification of the City, preserve and protect the City's
identity and natural environment, appearance and character of the surrounding neighborhoods, and promote
the general public safety and welfare by providing for tree preservation, landscaping and professional tree
harvest management. It is intended to assure that reasonable provisions and incentives to encourage sound
and sight buffers, preservation of scenic views and the elements of tree management will be available to
landowners. Additionally it will also specifically recognize the Texas State created Timber Tax Incentives system
for property, as utilized by the Angelina County Appraisal District, and commonly known as a 1d1 designation.
The Ordinance establishes the standards whereby landscape plans, tree reduction and usage plans will be
reviewed by the City for compliance and specifies the requirements for such plans. It is also the purpose of this
Ordinance to facilitate site design and construction, and protect and increase the value of properties within the
City.
Additionally, it is the purpose of this Ordinance to preserve and enhance the forest character of Lufkin. In
preserving and enhancing the urban forest, the City will maintain its unique identity and beauty and its natural
landscape that provides clean air, clean water, and flood control, which are essential to the economic future of
the City and its neighborhoods. The requirements hold participants to a minimum standard, but the City
encourages participants to reach for higher standards in keeping with the purpose to preserve and enhance the
forest character of Lufkin.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
SECTION 2 JURISDICTION AND APPLICABILITY
A. The Clearing Permit requirements shall apply to all land within the City limits. Indiscriminate clearing of
land is prohibited in the City of Lufkin. A Clearing Permit is required for all site work that involves tree removal.
Control and removal of underbrush is permitted without a Clearing Permit. A Clearing Permit is not required on
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 542/590
residentially developed property, single-family or duplex residentially platted lots, where construction is for a
single living unit.
B. The landscape requirements in this Ordinance shall apply to all land within the City limits in all zoning
districts, except for lands zoned as Agricultural, Residential Large Single-Family Dwelling, Residential Medium
Single-Family Dwelling, Residential Small Single-Family Dwelling, Duplex and Manufactured Dwelling Districts.
C. Requirements shall become applicable to each individual lot when the owner desires to use the property
for harvesting timber, begins developing the site for commercial use, or makes application for a Building Permit
on the lot. All required landscape areas shall be maintained. The City of Lufkin must comply with the
requirements of the Ordinance for areas other than right-of-way.
D. A private landowner or Timber Manager who is managing timber under a management plan with the intent
to produce income and who has a 1d1 Timber Productivity Valuation from the Tax Appraisal Office shall obtain
a Clearing Permit prior to harvesting timber. As a condition for obtaining a Clearing Permit, such landowner or
Timber Manager shall be required to follow the recognized forestry Best Management Practices (latest addition)
regarding Stream Management Zones as set forth in the Texas Forestry Best Practices Manual chapter titled
Stream Management Zones. Owners or managers of such property are encouraged to contact the City of Lufkin
Planning staff when changes in this designation will occur.
E. This Ordinance shall not apply to the following:
1. Public and Private right-of-way and easements;
2. Public tree care, private tree care.
F. The Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals is authorized to hear and decide appeals of any decision or
determination of the Director of Planning and grant a variance to the terms of this Ordinance.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
SECTION 3 COMPLIANCE
A. All landscaping items required by this Ordinance must be in compliance prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy, where required, or prior to the commencement of use. An Irrevocable Letter of Credit
made payable to the City of Lufkin, cashier's check or money order (in an amount equal to the cost of the
landscaping, as calculated by the City Engineer) may serve as a surety in lieu of installation during periods of
inclement weather that prevents proper installation of plants (as determined by the City Engineer). After
provision of a Letter of Credit, cashier's check or money order, as required herein, a Temporary Certificate of
Occupancy can be issued to the applicant upon written request.
B. Landscape areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment, after the construction phase, by
appropriate barriers.
C. Existing trees affected by construction shall be protected by appropriate temporary barricades as
approved by the Building Official.
D. Streams recognized by the approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) adopted
floodplain map shall be buffered from construction by an Undisturbed Area, except for those changes adopted
by a Letter of Map Revision or a Letter of Map Amendment. This buffer area shall be calculated by
measurement of a minimum of twenty-five feet (25') from the top of bank on either side of the stream. A
regulated stream must comply with the City of Lufkin Floodplain Prevention and Mitigation Ordinance, Number
3897.
E. There shall be no issuance of a Building or Clearing Permit until the City has received proof of a submitted
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), and all
TCEQ requirements have been complied with on the property when a SWPPP is required, except as described
in Section 2D above. The City of Lufkin Code Enforcement office shall enforce the TCEQ standard when
notified of noncompliance by the City Engineer.

SECTION 4 TREE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS
A. A Clearing Permit application for site development shall contain, where applicable, the following
information which may be provided, where known, on an aerial map or topographic map:
1. Areas of existing trees and areas to be cleared;
2. Proposed road right-of-way;
3. Utility easements and stubs;
4. Building pads;
5. Retention and detention ponds, drainage patterns;
6. Proposed grading and fill areas.
B. An owner may begin the clearing of land with an approved Clearing Permit, under the following conditions:
1. A Clearing Permit will be granted for clearing of land with the restriction that a minimum of five
(5) mature trees, six inch (6") in caliper or greater, per each acre of land, are left protected and
undisturbed on the property. The five (5) trees to be retained must be shown on the Clearing Permit
application. Trees in excess of the five (5) minimum, as described in this section, need to be shown
whether they are for site enhancement or for landscape requirements.
Properties that have been cleared of trees without reforestation prior to the passage of
the requirements of this Ordinance will have pre-existing, nonconforming status and shall
not be required to comply with this Ordinance's tree preservation requirements.
2. If the owner contends that the standards in Section 4, B, 1 cannot be met, a Clearing Permit
may be granted for clearing of land with the following restrictions:
a. A development plan is prepared and submitted by a Professional Engineer or submitted to
the City Engineer demonstrating in writing that there exist reasons that the clearing of land is
required for orderly use, development, or marketing of the property. Reasons for clearing of
land must include one or more of the following[:] health, safety, and welfare of the public; sight
distance at intersections and driveways; sidewalk requirements; drainage requirements;
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requirements; Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) erosion control requirements; utility installations; Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) requirements; Texas Accessibility Standards (TAS); building foundation requirements;
slope stability requirements; future requirements or restrictions that may be placed on
development by government authority; or
b. The property owner agrees to mitigate the impact of clearing the land by paying a Tree
Removal Mitigation Fee to the City, which shall be used for planting or replacing City trees. The
fee will be based on the size of the lot and the number of trees with a six-inch (6") caliper or
greater left undisturbed, per acre. Tree size and number must be calculated prior to any work
starting. The goal of this requirement is to retain a minimum of five (5) trees per acre. The fee
will be $300 per acre (minimum, indexed to the Houston Texas Consumer Price Index).
In those cases where trees have been cut on a site, the trees and harvesting debris shall
be removed within three (3) months of their cutting and disposed of in accordance with
City of Lufkin ordinances regarding waste and burning, with the exception of land
covered by Section 2D.

crown, which attains a height of at least thirty feet (30').
Clearing of Land: A property owner, developer, or contractor shall be considered “clearing” land if performing
one of the following actions: excavating, grading, regrading, land filling, berming, paving, diking, removing trees,
clearing, grubbing, or other earth changes.
Construction: Any activity on the property, normally following a Building Permit.
Critical Root Zone (CRZ): Area of undisturbed natural soil around a tree, defined by a concentric circle with a

trees on the site could be preserved and incorporated into future development on the site, whether such
clearing will alter the stormwater drainage patterns on the site in a way that could be detrimental to the City's
goals for protecting private property from flood damage and runoff, or whether such clearing would be counter
to the overall City policies and objectives for planting and protecting trees throughout the City.
Invasive Plant Species: Introduced plant species that can thrive in areas beyond their natural range of
dispersal. These plants are characteristically adaptable, aggressive and have a high reproductive capacity.
Their vigor combined with a lack of natural enemies often leads to outbreak populations.

of Angelina County or an unplatted tract or parcel of land as described and recorded in the Real Property
Records of Angelina County, Texas.
Protected Tree: A tree that has a barricaded area constructed in such a way that the tree is protected from
damage due to construction or from normal vehicular movement.

expected to cause a tree to die, including without limitation damage inflicted upon the root system by
machinery, storage or materials, or soil compaction.
Saved Tree: An existing tree, which is maintained in a living and growing condition.
Screening: A method of visual shielding or obscuring one (1) abutting or nearby structure or use from another
by fencing, walls and berms or densely planted vegetation.

ground level and normally an overall height of at least twelve feet (12') at maturity, usually with one (1) main
stem or trunk and many branches. It may appear to have several stems or trunks, as in several varieties of
oaks.
Undisturbed Area: The area of a property, which maintains the original natural vegetation including trees,
shrubs, grasses, ground cover, and plant materials.
Unprotected Tree: A tree that has no specially constructed protection barriers to prevent damage due to
construction or normal vehicular movement.
Vegetated Area: Ground area of a site that is covered by plants, trees, undergrowth and grasses.
Vegetation: Any type or kind of growing plant material.
Vested Rights: A “vested right” is generally the right to initiate or continue a development that is contrary to the
restrictions or regulations of a recently enacted zoning or land use regulation. Texas Local Government Code
Chapter 245 governs vested rights and creates a regulatory structure where developers and the public can rely
upon land use regulations in effect at the time a permit application is filed.
Wall Building Line: A line extending along the facade of the building(s), parallel to the property line(s) abutting a
street right-of-way line. It will be used to determine the overall area, depth and shape of the Street Yard.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 549/590
Trees, shrubs or ground cover in this area may be applied in meeting the landscaping requirements
for the development of the property. The plants in this area must be protected for current and future
periods. On sites where detention is required by the City of Lufkin for development, the detention
area will be subtracted from the total lot area when calculating landscape requirements. The City
Engineer must approve placement of landscaping in detention areas if landscaping is voluntarily
incorporated into a detention area. Trees, shrubs or ground cover in this area may be applied in
meeting the landscaping requirements for the development of the property. The City Engineer shall
evaluate the adequacy of proposed exclusions for floodway and detention areas.
C. Undisturbed Areas. On sites that contain an Undisturbed Area; the area will be subtracted from
the total lot area of the site when calculating landscape requirements. Undisturbed Areas that
exceed the minimum required landscape area, may be credited toward (used in lieu of) the required
landscape up to a maximum of eighty percent (80%). The remaining twenty percent (20%) of
required landscape shall be located in the Street Yard(s). All remaining Undisturbed Area, after
claiming a landscape credit, may be used for a reduction in required parking not to exceed ten
percent (10%) of the total parking required. Required parking credits will be awarded based on a
ratio of one (1) space per five hundred (500) square feet of Undisturbed Area. The same quantity of
Undisturbed Area may not be used for both a reduction in landscape and parking. No building permit
shall be issued for development within the Undisturbed Area if plants in this area are used for
meeting landscape requirements.
D. Alternative landscape designs. Alternative landscape designs that exceed the minimum
requirements, as determined by the Director of Planning, may be used for a reduction in required
parking not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the total parking required. Parking reductions from
alternative landscape designs will qualify at a ratio of one (1) space for every five hundred (500')

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 555/590
SECTION 1 DETERMINING PARKING REQUIREMENTS
Except as herein provided, any lot, or any structure or part thereof, that shall be used, erected, altered or
converted for any use permitted in the district in which it is located shall provide on that lot, vehicle parking at
the ratio specified in the Schedule of Permitted Uses. In computing the minimum parking requirements for any
building or development, the total parking requirements shall be the sum of the specific parking space
requirements for each class of use included in the building or development. Where parking requirements are
established on the basis of seats or person capacity, the building code provisions applicable at the time of
determination shall be used to define capacity.
SECTION 2 PARKING SHARING
Required parking for a development may be located off site when authorized by the Planning Director and
agreed to by all parties involved. The Planning Director may authorize such alternative location of required
parking space, along with any conditions determined necessary to promote safety and as will adequately serve
the public interest, subject to the following conditions:
A. Except for location, all other requirements relating to off-street parking shall be met;
B. Such space shall be conveniently usable without causing unreasonable;
1. Hazard to pedestrians;
2. Hazard to vehicular traffic;
3. Traffic congestion;
4. Detriment to the appropriate use of other properties in the vicinity; or
C. Location of the shared parking shall be within a functional distance.
D. A minimum of three spaces is required for all business uses though the remainder of the
required parking may be off site on a shared location up to a rate of fifty percent (50%) of the total
parking requirement.
E. A written agreement shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the Planning Director and executed by
all parties concerned, assuring the continued availability of the off-street parking facility for the
development it is intended to serve.
Notwithstanding any provision on the contrary, in no case shall a commercial use providing goods or services to
the general public on site provide less than three (3) parking spaces. Where fractional spaces result, the
parking spaces required shall be construed to be the nearest whole number.
SECTION 3 PARKING REQUIREMENTS AS RESULT OF SITE MODIFICATION
Whenever a building or use is changed to create a need for an increase of twenty-five percent (25%) or more in
the number of existing parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or
change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective date of this Ordinance is enlarged to the
extent of fifty percent (50%) or more in floor area or in the area used, said building or use shall then and
thereafter comply with the parking requirements established herein.
Any existing parking or lack of same for any conforming structure in the “CB - Central Business” District shall be
considered a conforming parking arrangement. In the event of destruction of a conforming structure in the “CB -
Central Business” District, such structure may be rebuilt to its pre-destruction size with no requirement for
additional parking. If such structure is rebuilt to exceed its pre-destruction size, it shall comply with the parking
requirements established therein.
SECTION 4 PARKING SPACE SIZE REQUIREMENT AND PERMITTED MATERIALS
To satisfy the off-street parking requirements, a parking space shall be paved with asphalt, concrete or similar
impervious surface and be provided with a similarly paved driveway connecting the parking space to a street or
improved (paved) alley. Artificially engineered pervious block or similar material may be utilized in place of

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 556/590
impervious surfacing when reviewed and approved by the City Engineer. The drive approach onto the right-ofway
must be composed of an impervious material. No off-street parking space adjacent to a street, wherein the
maneuvering of a vehicle for the purpose of entering or leaving the parking space is done on the street shall be
classified as off-street parking in determining satisfaction of any parking requirements herein specified, except
that parking requirements for single family and two-family residences may be met in such manner. No off-street
parking space shall project into any street right-of-way or easement or into any alley.
Additionally, any proposed parking that is in excess of the required amount of parking for a site may be
composed of artificially engineered pervious material or similar material or natural pervious materials (such as
gravel).
Minimum dimensions for off-street parking spaces are:
A. Ninety degree angle parking - each parking space shall not be less than nine (9) feet wide nor
less than nineteen (19) feet in length. The aisle width adjacent to the parking space shall be not less
than twenty-four (24) feet.

Except in the “CB - Central Business” District, all structures used for retail, commercial, industrial or service
purposes that receive or distribute materials or merchandise by means other than passenger vehicle shall
provide and maintain off-street loading space.
To satisfy the off-street loading requirement, the loading area shall be paved with asphalt, concrete or similar
impervious surface and be provided with a similarly paved driveway connecting the loading area to a street or
improved (paved) alley. Artificially engineered pervious block or similar material may be utilized in place of

farther than one hundred (100) feet from an entrance to the building. No off-street loading area wherein the
maneuvering of the delivery vehicle for the purpose of entering or leaving the loading area is done on the street
or in conflict with required parking spaces or associated drive aisles shall be classified as off-street loading.

[ARTICLE XXIII
NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT]
SECTION 1 NONCONFORMING USES
Any lawful use of property existing at the time of passage of this ordinance that does not conform with the
regulations prescribed in the preceding sections of this ordinance shall be deemed a nonconforming use.
A nonconforming use of land or a structure may be continued; however, when the nonconforming use is
discontinued for a period of six months, such use shall conclusively be deemed to have been abandoned and
shall not be resumed. Any future use of said premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
ordinance. Normal seasonal cessation of a use, or temporary discontinuance for purposes of maintenance or
rebuilding after damage or destruction as provided in this Article, shall not be included in calculating the period
of discontinuance.
If no structural alterations (except those required by law or ordinance) are made, a nonconforming use may be
extended throughout a building. A nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or more restricted zoning classification provided no structural alterations are made. In the
event a nonconforming use of a building is changed to a nonconforming use of a higher or more restrictive
zoning classification, it shall not later be reverted to a use in the former lower or less restrictive zoning
classification.
If the structures accommodating or serving a nonconforming use are damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion,
flood, tornado, riot or act of the public enemy, the structure may be rebuilt in accordance with this Article and
the nonconforming use may be resumed.
The right of nonconforming uses to continue shall be subject to such regulations as to the maintenance of the
premises and conditions of operation as may, in the judgment of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals,
be reasonably required for the protection of adjacent property.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
SECTION 2 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 558/590
A nonconforming structure may be continued and may be enlarged, repaired or altered provided such does not
create an additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity with respect to maximum
building height and minimum yard requirements. Any alteration or enlargement shall not extend further into the
required yard than the existing nonconforming portion of the building. This provision shall apply separately to
each yard requirement with which the existing structure does not comply.
Nothing in this section shall prevent the restoration within a period of twelve months of a nonconforming
building or structure which has been damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood, tornado, riot or act of the
public enemy. The restoration shall not create an additional nonconformity or increase the degree of
nonconformity established by the building or structure that was damaged or destroyed. A nonconforming
structure shall not be restored in case of obsolescence or demolition.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
SECTION 3 EFFECT OF NONCONFORMING DESIGNATION
A request for nonconforming designation, or request for relief under this designation, shall not create an
estoppel of the trial of any lawsuit which may be filed in any court. (Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as
revised through 10/19/2010)
ARTICLE XXIV
BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
There is hereby created a Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals consisting of five (5) members each to be
appointed by the City Council. The City Council shall also appoint four (4) alternate members of the Zoning
Board of Adjustments and Appeals who shall serve in the absence of one or more regular members when
requested to do so by the Mayor or the City Manager. The members and alternates of the Zoning Board of
Adjustments and Appeals shall be residents of the City of Lufkin, Texas, property owners, and qualified voters
of the City of Lufkin. Three (3) of the regular members shall be appointed for two (2) year terms and two (2)
regular members shall initially be appointed for one (1) year terms and the alternate members shall be
appointed for two (2) year terms. Any member is subject to removal for cause by City Council upon written
charges and after public hearings. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member or alternate
whose term becomes vacant. The Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals may adopt rules to govern its
proceedings, provided that such rules are not inconsistent with this ordinance. All cases to be heard by the
Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals will always be heard by a minimum of five (5) members.
All members present, including the Chairman shall vote on every motion. Any member of the Board present and
refusing to vote shall be entered in the minutes of such meeting as voting in the affirmative, provided however,
that a member of the Board shall not vote upon the consideration of any matter involving his own official
conduct or where his financial interest is involved; in which event such member shall give his reasons for not
voting and such reasons shall be entered upon the minutes of the Board. Minutes of all meetings of the Board
shall be taken and recorded and such shall constitute a public record. Meetings of the Zoning Board of
Adjustments and Appeals may be held at the call of the Chairman, who may administer oaths and compel the
attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall be open to the
public.
The Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall have the following powers:
A. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this ordinance.
Such appeals can be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board
or department of municipality affected by any decision of the administrative office. Such
appeals shall be taken within fifteen (15) days' time after the decision has been rendered
by the administrative office, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and
with the Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals, a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings upon the action appealed unless the officer from
whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals, after
the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts, stated in the
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 559/590
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals or by a court of record or
application [sic] on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause
shown.
The Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall hear an appeal within 30 days from
date of filing notice of appeal, after public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the
parties in interest and decide the same within 60 days from date of such hearing. Upon
the hearing any party may appear in person or by attorney or by agent.
B. To provide relief from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance when, because of special
circumstances applicable to the property, the strict application of the zoning regulations will deprive
such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity having the identical zoning
classification. The Board will ensure that any adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a
grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and
the district in which such property is situated.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals may grant a variance, due to an
unnecessary hardship, when it makes affirmative findings of fact on each of the following
criteria:
1. The hardship for which the variance is requested is unique to the property and not general
to the area in which the property is located;
2. The variance will not alter the character of the area adjacent to the property, will not
impair the use of adjacent conforming property, and will not impair the purposes or regulations
of the zoning district in which the property is located.
It may be considered an unnecessary hardship when a lot of record within a single-family
zoning district does not meet the dimensional requirements of that zoning district, and the
application of the dimensional requirements would deprive the property owner of a
structure deemed common to the majority of single-family residences and reasonably
required for the maintenance of the residence and for the protection of adjacent property.
C. In exercising its powers, the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of Articles 1001-A
and including 1011-J of the 1925 Civil Statutes of Texas, revise or reform wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and shall have all the
powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken, provided however, that the concurring vote of
four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to revise any order, requirements, decision or
determination of any such administrative official; or to decide in favor of the application on any
matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance or to affect any variances in said
ordinance.
Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning
Board of Adjustments and Appeals, or any officer, department, or Board of the
Municipality may present to court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such
decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within ten (10) days after the filing of the decision in the
office of the Board and not thereafter.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
ARTICLE XXV
ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTY FOR VIOLATION
The provisions of this ordinance shall be administered and enforced by the Building Official of the City. All
applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a site plan in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the
actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size of the building to be erected, the use of the property, and
such other information as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of the regulations. A careful record
of such applications and plats shall be kept in the office of the Building Official.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 560/590
Any person or corporation who shall violate any of the provisions of this ordinance or fail to comply therewith or
with any of the requirements thereof, or who shall build or alter any building or use in violation of any detailed
statement or plan submitted and approved hereunder, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be liable to a
fine of not more than one thousand ($1,000) dollars, and each day such violation shall be permitted to exist
shall constitute a separate offense. The owner or owners of any building or premises or part thereof, where any
thing in violation of this ordinance shall be placed or shall exist, and architect, builder, contractor, agent, person
or corporation employed in connection therewith, and who may have assisted in the commission of any such
violation shall be guilty of a separate offense and upon conviction shall be fined as herein provided.
(Ordinance 3368 adopted 2/10/1999, as revised through 10/19/2010)
ARTICLE XXVI
CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS
The City Council, by ordinance, may amend, supplement or change zoning district boundaries or the
regulations herein established. Any action by the City Council to amend, supplement or change zoning district
boundaries or other regulations herein established, shall be made only after a public hearing conducted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and receipt of a recommendation from the Commission. The City Council
shall also conduct a public hearing before adopting any amendment, supplement or change. Notwithstanding
any procedure established by the City of Lufkin to facilitate amendments, supplements, or changes, the
procedure shall comply with the minimum requirements established by the State of Texas.
Any person, firm or corporation having a proprietary interest in any property may make application requesting
an amendment, supplement or change to a zoning district boundary or regulation, herein established. Such
application shall consist of all necessary information and documentation to adequately convey the aspects of
the request. The application shall be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount established by the City Council.
The Planning and Zoning Commission, on its own volition; at the request of the City Council; or any city
department, board, agency or other commission, may study and propose amendments, supplements or
changes to zoning district boundaries or the regulations contained herein.
Where the Planning and Zoning Commission is considering a change in zoning or approval of a Special Use
Permit, the Commission may, within its discretion, make the following recommendations to the City Council:
A. Recommend approval of the change in zoning;
B. Recommend denial of the change in zoning;
C. Recommend denial of Special Use Permit;
D. Recommend approval of a Special Use Permit, allowing a specified use, within a higher
classified zoning district. Conditions of operation, location, arrangement and construction, may be
established when deemed important to the welfare and protection of adjacent property.
If a proposed change to a regulation or boundary receives written protest, being signed by the owners of at
least 20 percent of the area of the lots or land covered by the proposed change, or the area of the lots or land
immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed change and extending 200 feet from that area, then a
three-fourths affirmative vote of all the members of the City Council shall be required in order to take effect. In
computing the percentage of land under protest, the area of streets and alleys shall be included. Additionally,
an affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of all members of the City Council is required to overrule a
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission that a proposed change to a regulation or boundary
be denied in order for the change to take effect.
The Official Zoning Map of the City shall be kept in the City Planning Department, and all changes in district
boundaries shall be noted thereon immediately after approval by the City Council.
In those circumstances where a request for a change in zoning or a request for approval of a Special Use
Permit is denied by the Governing Body there may be no other submittal for approval for the same property
until a period of 12 months has passed. An exception may be granted to this provision for applications that have
undergone substantial change. Substantial change is evidenced by the addition of a buffer area between the
applicant and adjacent properties or the requested zoning classification has been changed from the original
7/15/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 561/590
application. Additionally, a formal request can be made to the Planning and Zoning Commission to determine
whether the application has substantial change and warrants being rescheduled for the Commission at a followon
meeting. Requests for determinations of substantial change will be listed as individual agenda items for the
Commission. This request must occur at a meeting separate from the hearing for approval.
