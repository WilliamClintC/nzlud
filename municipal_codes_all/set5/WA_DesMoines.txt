[Ord. 864 § 6, 1990.]


1.16.070 Assignment of serial number. 

Within five working days after issuance of a certificate of review by the city attorney, the petitioner, if he/she desires to proceed with sponsorship of the measure, shall file the measure together with the certificate of review with the city clerk for assignment of a serial number. The city clerk shall refuse to assign a serial number to the measure unless it is accompanied by a certificate of review. The city clerk shall give a unique serial number to each measure. The city clerk shall use a separate numbering series for initiatives and referendums. The city clerk shall forthwith transmit a copy of the measure proposed, bearing such number, to each city councilmember, the city manager, and the city attorney. Thereafter a measure shall be known and be designated on all petitions, ballots, and proceedings as “Initiative Measure No. ____” or “Referendum Measure No. ___ .” [Ord. 864 § 7, 1990.]


1.16.080 Ballot title and summary – Formulation by city attorney. 

(1) Within five working days after receipt of a measure bearing a serial number assigned by the city clerk, the city attorney shall formulate and transmit to the city clerk, a concise statement posed as a question (“ballot title”) and not to exceed 25 words, bearing the serial number of the measure and a summary of the measure, not to exceed 75 words, to follow the statement. The statement may be distinct from the legislative title of the measure and shall give a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure. Neither the statement nor the summary may intentionally be an argument, nor likely to create prejudice, either for or against the measure. The ballot title formulated by the city attorney shall be the ballot title of the measure unless changed by appeal. 

(2) When practicable, the ballot title shall be phrased in language so that a “for” vote on the measure will clearly be a vote in favor of changing the then current law, and an “against” vote on the measure will clearly be a vote that would result in no change to the current law. [Ord. 864 § 8, 1990.]


1.16.090 Ballot title and summary – Notice. 

Upon the filing of the ballot title and summary for an initiative or referendum petition in his/her office, the city clerk shall notify forthwith by telephone or by mail the person proposing the measure and any other individuals who have made written request for such notification of the exact language of the ballot title. [Ord. 864 § 9, 1990.]


1.16.100 Ballot title and summary – Appeal to superior court. 

(1) If any registered voter of the city is dissatisfied with the ballot title or summary formulated by the city attorney, he or she may, within 10 days from the filing of the ballot title and summary with the city clerk, appeal to superior court by petition setting forth the measure, the title, and summary formulated by the city attorney, and his or her objections to the ballot title or summary, and requesting amendment of the title or summary by the court. 

(2) A copy of the petition on appeal together with a notice that an appeal has been taken shall be served upon the city clerk, the city attorney, and upon the person proposing the measure if the appeal is initiated by someone other than that person. [Ord. 864 § 10, 1990.]


1.16.110 Ballot title and summary – Mailed to proponents and other persons – Appearance on petitions. 

When the ballot title and summary are finally established, the city clerk shall file the instrument establishing it with the proposed measure and transmit a copy thereof by mail to the person proposing the measure and to any other individuals who have made written request for such notification. Thereafter such ballot title shall be the title of the measure in all petitions, ballots, and other proceedings in relation thereto. The summary shall appear on all petitions directly following the ballot title. [Ord. 864 § 11, 1990.]


1.16.120 Petitions – Paper – Size – Contents. 

The person proposing the measure shall print blank petitions upon single sheets of paper of good writing quality not less than 8 1/2 inches in width and not less than 11 inches in length. Every signer to a petition shall add to his/her signature the place of residence giving street and number. The signatures need not all be appended to one paper, but one of the signers on each paper must attach thereto an affidavit stating the number of signatures thereon, that each signature thereon is a genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, and that the statements thereon made are true as he believes. Petitions shall be in the form required by DMMC 1.16.130 or 1.16.140, and shall have a full, true, and correct copy of the proposed measure referred to therein attached to the petition.

If the petitioner fails to file such petition within the prescribed time limit, it shall have no validity and the petition shall not be considered by the city council as an initiative petition. 

(2) Referendum petitions containing the required signatures must be filed with the city clerk within 30 days from the passage of a nonexempt ordinance by the council, petitioning the council to reconsider a nonexempt ordinance which is subject to referendum, or to submit the same to a vote of the people.

No signatures shall be accepted or withdrawn after such terminal date; provided, if the signatures are found by the city clerk to be insufficient, the petition may be amended in that respect within 10 days from the date of the certificate. Within 10 days after submission of the amended petition the city clerk shall make an examination thereof and append his/her certificate thereto in the manner provided for in DMMC 1.16.180. 

(2) Any signer of a filed petition may withdraw his or her signature by a written request for withdrawal filed with the city clerk prior to such terminal date. Such written request shall so sufficiently describe the petition as to make identification of the person and the petition certain. The name of any person seeking to withdraw shall be signed exactly the same as contained on the petition and, after the filing of such request for withdrawal, prior to the terminal date, the signature of any person seeking such withdrawal shall be deemed withdrawn. [Ord. 864 § 17, 1990.]


1.16.180 Petitions – Checking by city clerk.

(3) Petitions containing the required number of signatures shall be accepted as prima facie valid until their invalidity has been proved.

(b) That the petition clearly bears insufficient signatures; 

(c) That the time within which the petition may be filed has expired;

(2) In case of such refusal, the city clerk shall endorse on the petition the expression “submitted and refused,” the reason for the refusal, and the date, and shall retain the petition pending appeal. 

(3) If none of the grounds for refusal exists, the city clerk shall accept and file the petition. [Ord. 864 § 19, 1990.]


1.16.200 Petition – Review of refusal to accept and file. 

(1) If the city clerk refuses to file a petition when submitted to him/her for filing, the person submitting it for filing may apply to superior court for a citation requiring the city clerk to bring the petition before the court, and for a writ of mandamus to compel him/her to file it. Any such action must be filed in superior court within 10 days following such refusal. 

(2) If the court issues the citation, and determines that the petition is legal in form and apparently contains the requisite number of signatures and was submitted for filing within the time prescribed by state law, it shall issue its mandate requiring the city clerk to file it in his/her office as of the date of submission for filing. [Ord. 864 § 20, 1990.]


1.16.210 Petition – Destruction on final refusal. 

If no appeal is taken from the refusal of the city clerk to file a petition within the time prescribed, or if an appeal is taken and the city clerk is not required to file the petition by the mandate of the superior court, the city clerk may destroy it. [Ord. 864 § 21, 1990.]


1.16.220 Initiative petition – Council action.

(1) Pass the proposed ordinance without alteration within 20 days after the city clerk’s certificate that the number of signatures on the petition are sufficient; or 

(2) Within 20 days after the city clerk’s certificate of sufficiency is attached to the petition, cause to be called a special election to be held not less than 30 nor more than 60 days thereafter, for submission of the proposed ordinance without alteration, to a vote of the people unless a general election will occur within 90 days, in which event submission must be made at the general election. [Ord. 864 § 22, 1990.]


1.16.230 Referendum petition – Council action – Filing suspends ordinance. 

(1) Upon the filing of a referendum petition, which contains the required number of signatures, and which is filed within 30 days of the passage of such ordinance, petitioning therein that such ordinance be submitted to the electorate, the city council shall either: 

(a) Enact an ordinance repealing the subject ordinance in its entirety within 20 days after the city clerk’s certificate that the number of signatures on the petition are sufficient; or 

(b) Within 20 days after the city clerk’s certificate of sufficiency is attached to the petition, cause to be called a special election to be held not less than 30 nor more than 60 days thereafter, for submission of the proposed ordinance without alteration, to a vote of the people unless a general election will occur within 90 days, in which event submission must be made at the general election. 

(2) The operation of an ordinance so protested against shall be suspended until: (a) the referendum petition is finally found insufficient or untimely; or (b) the legislative action so referred is approved by the voters at a referendum election. [Ord. 864 § 23, 1990.]


1.16.240 Petition – Appeal to superior court if city council fails to act. 

Following receipt of a valid petition, if the city council refuses either to pass an initiative ordinance, to order an election thereon, or to refer an ordinance to a vote of the people, any taxpayer within the city may commence an action in superior court against the city for the purpose of requiring an election to be held in the city for the purpose of voting upon the proposed ordinance. Any such action must be filed within 60 days of the date the city council should have taken the appropriate action. [Ord. 864 § 24, 1990.]


1.16.250 Substitute for rejected initiative. 

If the city council, having rejected a measure submitted to it by initiative petition, proposes a different measure dealing with the same subject, the city clerk shall give that measure the same number as that borne by the initiative measure followed by the letter “B.” Such measure so designated as “Alternative Measure No. ___ B,” together with a ballot title, when determined, shall be placed on the ballot along with the initiative measure. [Ord. 864 § 25, 1990.]


1.16.260 Substitute for rejected initiative – Ballot title. 

For a measure designated by him/her as “Alternative Measure No. ___ B,” the city clerk shall obtain from the city attorney a ballot title in the manner provided for obtaining ballot titles for initiative measures. The ballot title therefor shall be different from the ballot title of the measure in lieu of which it is proposed, and shall indicate, as clearly as possible, the essential differences in the measure. [Ord. 864 § 26, 1990.]


1.16.270 Conduct of election. 

Publication of notice, the election, the canvass of the returns, and declaration of the results shall be conducted in all respects as are other city elections.

1.24.010 Short title.

This chapter is known as and may be referred to as the “civil infraction code.” [Ord. 1009 § 1, 1993.]


1.24.020 Findings.

The city council finds that many minor misdemeanor offenses are obsolete or are more appropriately punished by the imposition of civil penalties. The city council finds that the decriminalization of some misdemeanors would allow resources of the legal system, such as judges, prosecutors, juries, and jails, to be used to punish serious criminal behavior, since acts characterized as criminal behavior have a tremendous fiscal impact on the legal system. 

The city council finds that the establishment of a uniform system of civil infractions is a more expeditious and less expensive method of disposing of minor offenses and will decrease the cost and work load of the court. [Ord. 1009 § 2, 1993.]


1.24.030 Definitions.

(1) Use of Words and Phrases. As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter clearly requires otherwise, the words or phrases defined in this section shall have the indicated meanings.

(2) “Civil infraction case” means a proceeding, other than a traffic infraction, initiated in the court pursuant to an ordinance that authorizes offenses to be punished as infractions.

(3) “Court” means the Municipal Court of the city of Des Moines.

(4) “Defendant” means a person named in a notice of infraction.

(5) “Enforcement officer” means a law enforcement officer or other official authorized to enforce the provisions of the title or ordinance in which the civil infraction is established.

(6) “IRLJ” means the current edition of the “Infraction Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction,” as published by the state Supreme Court.

(7) “Notice of infraction” means a document initiating a civil infraction case when issued and filed pursuant to this chapter. [Ord. 1009 § 3, 1993.]


1.24.040 Jurisdiction of the court.

Under this chapter, the court has authority to hear and determine civil infractions established by ordinance of the city council and committed within the jurisdiction of the city. [Ord. 1009 § 4, 1993.]


1.24.050 Issuance of process.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing service of process in civil cases, if the court has jurisdiction over an alleged civil infraction, it may issue process anywhere within the state. [Ord. 1009 § 5, 1993.]


1.24.060 Notice of infraction – Issuance, service, filing.

(1) A civil infraction proceeding is initiated by the issuance, service, and filing of a notice of infraction.

(1) A person who receives a notice of infraction under DMMC 1.24.060 is required to identify himself or herself to the enforcement officer by giving his or her true name, address, and date of birth. Upon request of the officer, the person shall produce reasonable identification, including a driver’s license or identicard.

(2) A person who is unable or unwilling to reasonably identify himself or herself to the enforcement officer may be detained for a time not longer than is reasonably necessary to identify the person for purposes of issuing a civil infraction. [Ord. 1009 § 7, 1993.]


1.24.080 Notice – Form.

(3) The City Council may by resolution provide for pay plans other than the basic pay plan.

(2) Contract. All indigent defense services shall be paid pursuant to a written contract between the indigent defense attorney(s) and the city, with input from judicial officers.

(3) Compensation. All indigent defense attorneys shall be reasonably compensated, taking into consideration the experience and training of the attorney. Attorneys who have a conflict of interest shall be required to select or compensate conflict counsel.

(4) Duties and Responsibilities of Counsel. All indigent defense contracts shall require that services be provided to all clients in a professional, skilled manner consistent with minimum standards set forth by the American Bar Association, applicable Washington State Bar Association standards, the Rules of Professional Conduct, case law and applicable court rules defining the duties of counsel and the rights of defendants. Counsel’s primary and most fundamental responsibility is to promote and protect the best interests of the client.

(5) Malpractice Insurance. Indigent defense attorneys shall maintain malpractice insurance with agreed-upon policy limits.

(6) Caseload Limits and Types of Cases. Caseloads shall be limited to ensure effective representation. An attorney should not allow his or her private law practice to interfere with the competent representation of indigent defendants.

The caseload standards adopted by the Washington State Bar Association, Washington Defender Association and/or American Bar Association shall be considered as guidelines. A “case” is defined as the filing of a document wherein a person is designated a defendant or respondent and an attorney is appointed by the court. Adjustments may be made wherein a full case is not attributed in the following nonexclusive circumstances:

(a) A bench warrant is issued before a case is resolved;

(b) Probation violation, extradition, restitution hearings, etc., that do not require a full-blown hearing;

(c) Diversions, continuances for dismissal, misdemeanor compromises or similar dispositions;

(d) Deferred prosecution or other similar procedure;

(e) Early dismissal by a prosecutor based on lack of evidence or standard plea offers, based on the prosecutor’s charging and plea bargaining practices or other reasons that dispose of a case without extensive litigation; or

(f) Withdrawal of counsel at an early stage of the case, due to conflict of interest or other reasons.

Attorneys providing indigent defense services, judicial officers and city administration shall monitor caseloads to assure adequate representation and progress in moving cases to final adjudication. The above-mentioned parties should not hesitate to confer and craft a remedy for dealing with caseload issues that materially affect representation of an indigent client. Excessive continuances, missed court dates, client complaints, etc., shall be addressed as soon as practicable.

(7) Services Other Than Counsel. Reasonable compensation for expert witnesses, investigators and other services necessary for an adequate preparation and presentation of the defense case shall be provided pursuant to Criminal Rule 3.1(f).

(8) Administrative Expenses. Attorneys shall be responsible for paying all administrative expenses of their office or firm not otherwise provided for in these standards or in a contract. Such costs may include law libraries, financial accounting, case management systems and other costs incurred in the day-to-day management of the contract. Attorneys shall maintain an office to maintain confidential meetings with clients.

(9) Reports of Attorney Activity and Vouchers. Attorneys on contract shall maintain a case reporting and management information system which includes the number and type of cases, and disposition of each case. Any such system shall be maintained independently from client files so as to disclose no privileged information. At least quarterly reports shall be submitted by the contract firm to the court and to the city administration.

A standardized voucher form shall be used by attorneys seeking payment for services rendered. Payment should be made at times agreed to by the parties, without regard to the number of cases closed in the period.

(10) Training. Attorneys shall participate in regular training programs in areas relating to their indigent defense practice.

Attorneys providing counsel to indigent accused should take the opportunity to attend courses that foster trial advocacy skills and to review professional publications and tapes.

(11) Supervision. Each attorney or firm providing indigent defense services should provide adequate supervision of attorneys providing indigent defense services.

(12) Substitution of Attorneys or Assignment of Contracts. The attorney or firm engaged by the respective city to provide indigent defense services shall not subcontract with another firm or attorney to provide representation without prior written approval and shall remain directly involved in the provision of representation. If the contract is with a firm or office, the respective city or judicial officer may request the names and experience levels of those attorneys who will actually be providing the services, to ensure they meet minimum qualifications. Any indigent defense contract shall address the procedures for new counsel taking over upon the conclusion of the contract to ensure a smooth transition upon nonrenewal or termination, with the minimal possible detriment to the indigent client.

(13) Limitations on Private Practice for Contract Attorneys. New contracts for indigent defense attorneys with private attorneys or firms may set limits on the number of private or special appointment cases. These limits shall be based on the percentage of a full-time caseload which the public defense cases represent. An attorney or firm rendering indigent defense services shall not allow his or her private practice or accept special appointments to diminish his or her ability to represent indigent clients he or she is obligated to serve by any contract.

(14) Disposition of Client Complaints. The following procedure shall be utilized for responding to client complaints: Complaints should first be directed to the attorney, firm or agency which provided representation. If the attorney and client cannot resolve the complaint amicably, the attorney shall ask the court to withdraw and substitute new counsel. The complaining client should be informed as to the disposition of his or her complaint within a reasonable period of time. If the client feels dissatisfied with the evaluation and response received, he or she should be advised of the right to complain to the Washington State Bar Association.

(15) Cause for Termination or Removal of Attorney. Contracts for indigent defense services should include the grounds for termination of the contract by the parties. Termination of an attorney’s contract should only be for good cause or as provided within the terms of the agreement between the city and firm or attorney. Good cause shall include the failure of the attorney to render adequate representation to clients; the wilful disregard of the rights and best interests of the client; the wilful disregard of the standards herein addressed; or violations of the RPCs.

The representation in an individual case establishes an inviolable attorney-client relationship. Removal of counsel from representation, therefore, should not occur over the objections of both the attorney and the client.

(16) Nondiscrimination. Neither the city, in its selection of an attorney, firm, or agency to provide indigent defense representation, nor the attorneys selected, in their hiring practices or in their representation of clients, shall discriminate on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, or handicap. Both the city and the contractor shall comply with all federal, state, and local nondiscrimination requirements.

(17) Guidelines for Awarding Defense Contracts. The city shall award contracts for indigent defense services only after determining that the attorney or firm chosen can meet appropriate professional standards and qualifications. Under no circumstances will a contract be awarded on the basis of cost alone. Attorneys or firms seeking contracts for indigent defense services must demonstrate their ability to meet these standards.

Prosecutor and law enforcement officers shall not select the attorneys who will provide indigent defense services. [Ord. 1449 §§ 1 – 17, 2009.]


2.28.110 Municipal Court seal.

The Municipal Court shall have a seal which shall be the vignette of George Washington, with words “Seal of the Municipal Court of Des Moines, State of Washington” surrounding the vignette. [Ord. 1635 § 1, 2015.]1

(2) The standard of prudence used by investment officials is the “prudent person rule” and it is applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting according to written procedures and exercising due diligence are relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is take to control adverse developments. [Ord. 1144 § 5, 1995.]


3.12.030 Objective.

The following primary objectives, in descending order of priority, of the city of Des Moines’ investment activities are:

(1) Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost investment objective of the city of Des Moines. Investments of the city of Des Moines are undertaken in such a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this satisfaction, diversification is required so portfolio losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio.

(2) Liquidity. The city of Des Moines’ investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city of Des Moines to meet all operating requirements that might be reasonably anticipated.

(3) Return on Investment. The city of Des Moines’ investment portfolio is designed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the city of Des Moines’ investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. [Ord. 1144 § 6, 1995.]


3.12.040 Delegation of authority.

Management responsibility for the investment program is delegated to the finance director, who shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program, consistent with this investment policy. Such procedures shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No person shall engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the finance director. The finance director is responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. [Ord. 1144 § 7, 1995.]


3.12.050 Ethics and conflicts of interest.

Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activities that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the city manager any material financial interest in financial institutions that conduct business within this jurisdiction, and they shall further disclose all large personal financial or investment positions that could be related to the performance of the city of Des Moines’ portfolio. Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the city of Des Moines, particularly regarding the time of purchases and sales. [Ord. 1144 § 8, 1995.]

(b) The rights, duties, responsibilities, and compensation of the registrar shall be prescribed in each ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds or obligations, which rights, duties, responsibilities, and compensation shall be embodied in a contract executed by the finance director and the registrar, except in instances when the fiscal agencies serve as registrar, the city adopts by reference the contract between the State Finance Committee and the fiscal agencies in lieu of executing a separate contract and prescribing by ordinance the rights, duties, obligations, and compensation of the registrar. When the finance director serves as registrar, a separate contract shall not be required.

(c) In all cases when the registrar is not the fiscal agencies and the obligation is assignable, the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the registered bonds or obligations shall specify the terms and conditions of:

(i) Making payments of principal and interest;

(ii) Printing any physical instruments, including the use of identifying numbers or other designation;

3.40.320 Collection and segregation of assessments.

(1) Whenever any land against which there has been levied any special assessment by the municipality has been sold in part or subdivided, the council shall have the power to order a segregation of the assessment.

(2) Any person desiring to have such a special assessment against a tract of land segregated to apply to smaller parts thereof shall apply in writing to the municipality. If the council determines that a segregation should be made, it shall by resolution order the finance director to make segregation on the original assessment roll as directed in the resolution. The segregation shall be made as nearly as possible on the same basis as the original assessment was levied, and the total of the segregated parts of the assessment shall equal the assessment before segregation. The resolution shall describe the original tract, the amount and date of the original assessment, and shall define the boundaries of the divided parts and the amount of the assessment chargeable to each part. A certified copy of the resolution shall be delivered to the finance director who shall proceed to make the segregation ordered upon being tendered payment of the fees provided in DMMC 3.40.330. No segregation need be made if the council finds that by such segregation the security of the lien for such assessment will be so jeopardized as to reduce the security for any outstanding local improvement district obligations payable from such assessment. In such instance the finance director shall determine that question of fact. No segregation shall be made of any assessment which has been delinquent for a period of two years or more. No segregation of any assessment on unplatted lands or large platted tracts shall be made until a plat thereof has been furnished to the designated official by the applicant for segregation showing that the proposed segregation of property will conform to the system of streets as platted in adjacent territory. In all such instances the designated official shall determine such question of fact. [Ord. 1144 § 63(15), 1995; Ord. 476 § 2(2.300), 1979. Formerly 3.32.320.]


3.40.330 Segregation fees.

This fund shall be designated the “local improvement guaranty fund,” and is sometimes referred to as the “guaranty fund.” [Ord. 1144 § 63(15), 1995; Ord. 476 § 3(part), 1979. Formerly 3.32.340.]

Whenever the municipality has paid out of the guaranty fund any sum on account of principal and interest on a local improvement bond or warrant hereunder guaranteed, the municipality, as trustee for such fund, shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the holder of the bond, interest coupon, or warrant so paid, and the proceeds thereof, or of the underlying assessments, shall become a part of such fund.

(2) The finance director is authorized and directed to pay into the local improvement guaranty fund all interest received from bank deposits of that fund, as well as any surplus remaining in any local improvement district fund guaranteed under the laws of the state after the payment of all outstanding bonds or warrants payable primarily out of such local improvement district fund.

[Ord. 1144 § 63(15), 1995; Ord. 476 § 3(3.020), 1979. Formerly 3.32.360.]


3.40.370 Warrants against guaranty fund.

Warrants drawing interest at a rate not to exceed six percent per year shall be issued, as other warrants are issued by the municipality, against the local improvement guaranty fund to meet any liability accruing against it. At the time of making its annual budget and tax levy, the municipality shall provide for the levying of a sum sufficient, with the other resources of the fund, to pay warrants so issued during the preceding fiscal year.

Any person aggrieved by such decision may file an appeal in writing to the city council within 10 days after receipt of the administration’s decision. The decision of the city manager or his designee shall be final and binding unless such appeal is timely filed with the city clerk. Thereafter, the city clerk shall timely place the matter on the agenda of the city council and notify the applicant of the time and date in writing. The applicant shall have an opportunity to be heard before the city council at a public meeting. The decision of the city council shall be final and binding on the parties. The application for either a phase one or phase two deferral shall be made on a yearly basis; that is, the granting of either type of deferral shall be limited to one year, and the burden is upon the applicant to establish to the satisfaction of the city that he qualifies for a deferral on a yearly basis. The city shall have the authority to require the applicant to justify his deferral status at any time during a deferral period if the city has reasonable cause to believe that the financial condition of the applicant is such that his deferral status is no longer justified. All deferrals shall require an agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of the deferral and the applicant shall execute any necessary instrument to perfect any lien. [Ord. 1144 § 63(16), 1995; Ord. 479 § 6, 1979. Formerly 3.36.060.]

The city finance director shall draw such warrants upon the local improvement guaranty fund as necessary and appropriate to make payments to the local improvement district fund for assessments, the collection of which have been deferred and shall report annually to the city council the amount of such payments. With respect to phase two deferrals, the city finance director shall establish a fund entitled local improvement districts, phase two deferral fund and place in such fund such amount of revenue as is annually appropriated by the city council. Thereafter, the city finance director shall draw warrants upon such fund as necessary and appropriate to make requisite phase two payments and shall report annually to the city council the amount of such payments. The city manager shall annually recommend to the city council the amount to be appropriated for such fund. Should the city council decline to appropriate sufficient funds for the city finance director to make the phase two deferral payments, such phase two deferrals shall lapse and the person responsible for making such payment shall thereafter make payments to the local improvement district fund as if the phase two deferral had not been granted.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement Washington Constitution Article XI, Sec. 12, and RCW 35A.11.020 and 35A.82.020, which give municipalities the authority to license for revenue. In the absence of a legal or constitutional prohibition, the city has the power to define taxation categories as they see fit in order to respond to the unique concerns and responsibilities of local government. [Ord. 1555 § 2, 2012.]


3.84.020 Exercise of revenue license power.

The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the power of the city to license for revenue. The provisions of this chapter are subject to periodic statutory or administrative rule changes or judicial interpretations of the ordinances or rules. The responsibility rests with the licensee or taxpayer to reconfirm tax computation procedures and remain in compliance with the city code. [Ord. 1555 § 3, 2012.]


3.84.030 Administrative provisions.

The administrative provisions contained in chapter 3.85 DMMC shall be fully applicable to the provisions of this chapter except as expressly stated to the contrary herein. [Ord. 1555 § 4, 2012.]


3.84.040 Definitions.

In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall be applied. Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular.

(1) “Business” includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the taxpayer or to another person or class, directly or indirectly.

(2) “Business and occupation tax” or “gross receipts tax” means a tax imposed on or measured by the value of products, the gross income of the business, or the gross proceeds of sales, as the case may be, and that is the legal liability of the business.

(3) “Commercial or industrial use” means the following uses of products, including by-products, by the extractor or manufacturer thereof:

(a) Any use as a consumer; and

(b) The manufacturing of articles, substances or commodities.

(4) “Delivery” means the transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the seller and the buyer or the buyer’s representative. Delivery to an employee of a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer’s representative first takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over the property. “Dominion and control” means the buyer has the ability to put the property to the buyer’s own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer’s representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property, and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer has no right to return the property to the seller, other than under a warranty contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to itself. A buyer’s representative is a person, other than an employee of the buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a buyer’s representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (Title 62A RCW) do not determine when or where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of taxation.

(5) “Digital automated service,” “digital code,” and “digital goods” have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.192.

(6) “Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(b).

(7) “Eligible gross receipts tax” means a tax which:

(a) Is imposed on the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within DMMC 3.84.050; and

(b) Is measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts and is not an income tax or value added tax; and

(c) Is not, pursuant to law or custom, separately stated from the sales price; and

(d) Is not a sales or use tax, business license fee, franchise fee, royalty or severance tax measured by volume or weight, or concession charge, or payment for the use and enjoyment of property, property right or a privilege; and

(e) Is a tax imposed by a local jurisdiction, whether within or without the State of Washington, and not by a country, state, province, or any other nonlocal jurisdiction above the county level.

(8) Engaging in Business.

(a) The term “engaging in business” means commencing, conducting, or continuing in business, and also the exercise of corporate or franchise powers, as well as liquidating a business when the liquidators thereof hold themselves out to the public as conducting such business.

(b) This section sets forth examples of activities that constitute engaging in business in the City, and establishes safe harbors for certain of those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimis business activities in the City without having to register and obtain a business license or pay City business and occupation taxes. The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business” in subsection (8)(a) of this section. If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the City shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and applicable law.

(c) Without being all inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted within the City by a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker or another acting on its behalf, constitutes engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business license:

(i) Owning, renting, leasing, maintaining, or having the right to use, or using, tangible personal property, intangible personal property, or real property permanently or temporarily located in the City.

(ii) Owning, renting, leasing, using, or maintaining an office, place of business, or other establishment in the City.

(i) Meeting with suppliers of goods and services as a customer.

(ii) Meeting with government representatives in their official capacity, other than those performing contracting or purchasing functions.

(iii) Attending meetings, such as board meetings, retreats, seminars, and conferences, or other meetings wherein the person does not provide training in connection with tangible personal property sold by the person or on its behalf. This provision does not apply to any board of directors member or attendee engaging in business such as a member of a board of directors who attends a board meeting.

(iv) Renting tangible or intangible property as a customer when the property is not used in the City.

(v) Attending, but not participating in, a “trade show” or “multiple vendor events.” Persons participating at a trade show shall review the City’s trade show or multiple vendor event ordinances.

(vi) Conducting advertising through the mail.

(vii) Soliciting sales by phone from a location outside the City.

(e) A seller located outside the City merely delivering goods into the City by means of common carrier is not required to register and obtain a business license; provided, that it engages in no other business activities in the City. Such activities do not include those in subsection (8)(d) of this section.

The City expressly intends that engaging in business includes any activity sufficient to establish nexus for purposes of applying the tax under the law and the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Washington. Nexus is presumed to continue as long as the taxpayer benefits from the activity that constituted the original nexus-generating contact or subsequent contacts.

(9) “Extracting” is the activity engaged in by an extractor and is reportable under the extracting classification.

(10) “Extractor” means every person who from the person’s own land or from the land of another under a right or license granted by lease or contract, either directly or by contracting with others for the necessary labor or mechanical services, for sale or for commercial or industrial use, mines, quarries, takes or produces coal, oil, natural gas, ore, stone, sand, gravel, clay, mineral or other natural resource product; or fells, cuts or takes timber, Christmas trees, other than plantation Christmas trees, or other natural products; or takes fish, shellfish, or other sea or inland water foods or products. “Extractor” does not include persons performing under contract the necessary labor or mechanical services for others; or persons meeting the definition of “farmer.”

(13) “Gross proceeds of sales” means the value proceeding or accruing from the sale of tangible personal property, digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services or for other services rendered, without any deduction on account of the cost of property sold, the cost of materials used, labor costs, interest, discount paid, delivery costs, taxes, or any other expense whatsoever paid or accrued and without any deduction on account of losses.

(15) Manufacturer, To Manufacture.

When the owner of equipment or facilities furnishes, or sells to the customer prior to manufacture, materials or ingredients equal to less than 20 percent of the total value of all materials or ingredients that become a part of the finished product, the owner of the equipment or facilities will be deemed to be a processor for hire, and not a manufacturer.

(1) Amounts Subject to an Eligible Gross Receipts Tax in Another City That Also Maintains Nexus over the Same Activity. For taxes due prior to January 1, 2008, a taxpayer that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax on the same activity in more than one jurisdiction may be entitled to a deduction as follows:

(a) A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax, with respect to a sale of goods or services, to a jurisdiction in which the goods are delivered or the services are provided may deduct an amount equal to the gross receipts used to measure that tax from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

(b) Notwithstanding the above, a person that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax in more than one jurisdiction on the gross income derived from intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall assign those gross receipts to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located).

(c) A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax on the privilege of accepting or executing a contract with another city may deduct an amount equal to the contract price used to measure the tax due to the other city from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

(2) Person Manufacturing Products Within and Without.

[Ord. 1555 § 8, 2012.]


3.84.080 Assignment of gross income derived from intangibles.

Gross income derived from the sale of intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall be assigned to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located). [Ord. 1555 § 9, 2012.]


3.84.090 Allocation and apportionment of income when activities take place in more than one jurisdiction.

Effective January 1, 2008, gross income, other than persons subject to the provisions of chapter 82.14A RCW, shall be allocated and apportioned as follows:

(1) Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as service or royalties under DMMC 3.84.050(1)(g) shall be allocated to the location where the activity takes place.

(2) In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.

(3) In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:

(a) The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller’s place of business;

(b) If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;

(c) If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;

(d) If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and

(e) If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.

(4) If none of the methods in subsection (3) of this section for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections (3)(a) through (e) of this section, then the City and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the City to use an alternative method under this subsection. The City may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections (3)(a) through (e) of this section are not available and the taxpayer and the City are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.

(5) For purposes of subsections (3)(a) through (e) of this section, the following definitions apply:

(a) “Digital automated services,” “digital codes,” and “digital goods” have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.192;

(b) “Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(c); and

(c) “Receive” has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.730.

(6) Gross income derived from activities taxed as services and other activities taxed under DMMC 3.85.050(1)(g) shall be apportioned to the City by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service-income factor and the denominator of which is two.

(a) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the City during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the City if:

(i) The individual is primarily assigned within the City;

(ii) The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs 50 percent or more of his or her service for the tax period in the City; or

(iii) The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform 50 percent or more of his or her service in any city and the employee resides in the City.

(b) The service-income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer in the City during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service income is in the City if the customer location is in the City.

(c) Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service-income factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the City, and the gross income is attributable under subsection (6)(b) of this subsection to a city or unincorporated area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (6), “not taxable” means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under the standards in RCW 35.102.050 regardless of whether that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes such a tax.

(d) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (6) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the City, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:

(i) Separate accounting;

(ii) The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

(iii) The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the City; or

(iv) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

(e) The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection (6)(d) of this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:

(i) That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (6) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the City; and

(ii) That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable.

The same burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

(f) If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the tax administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (6).

(g) A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.

(7) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

(5) “Tax year” or “taxable year” means the calendar year. [Ord. 1556 § 3, 2012.]


3.85.040 Definitions – References to chapter 82.32 RCW.

Where provisions of chapter 82.32 RCW are incorporated in DMMC 3.85.120, “Department” as used in the RCW shall refer to the “director” as defined in DMMC 3.85.030 and “warrant” as used in the RCW shall mean “citation or criminal complaint.” [Ord. 1556 § 4, 2012.]

(1) Other than any annual license fee or registration fee assessed under this chapter, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in quarterly installments. At the Director’s discretion, businesses may be assigned to a monthly or annual reporting period depending on the tax amount owing or type of tax. Until December 30, 2020, tax payments are due on or before the last day of the next month following the end of the assigned reporting period covered by the return. Effective January 21, 2021, tax payments are due on or before the time as provided in RCW 82.32.045(1), (2), and (3).

(2) Taxes shall be paid as provided in this chapter and accompanied by a return on forms as prescribed by the Director. The return shall be signed by the taxpayer personally or by a responsible officer or agent of the taxpayer. The individual signing the return shall swear or affirm that the information in the return is complete and true.

(3) Tax returns must be filed and returned by the due date whether or not any tax is owed.

(4) For purposes of the tax imposed by chapter 3.84 DMMC, any person whose value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business, subject to tax after all allowable deductions, is equal to or less than $50,000 in the current calendar year shall file a return, declare no tax due on their return, and submit the return to the Director. The gross receipts and deduction amounts shall be entered on the tax return even though no tax may be due.

(5) A taxpayer that commences to engage in business activity shall file a return and pay the tax or fee for the portion of the reporting period during which the taxpayer is engaged in business activity.

(6) Except as otherwise specifically provided by any other provision of this chapter, in computing any period of days prescribed by this chapter the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time runs shall not be included. The last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or City or federal legal holiday, in which case the last day of such period shall be the next succeeding day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or City or federal legal holiday.

(7) If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to make a return as and when required in this chapter, the Director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the Director’s estimate of the tax or fees due. Such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the City by the taxpayer. The Director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. [Ord. 1725 § 4, 2019: Ord. 1556 § 7, 2012.]


3.85.080 Payment methods – Mailing returns or remittances – Time extension – Deposits – Recording payments – Payment must accompany return – NSF checks.

(1) Taxes shall be paid to the director in United States currency by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, personal check, money order, cash, or by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic payment is authorized by the director. If payment so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered, shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the same as if such payment had not been tendered. Acceptance of any sum by the director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.

(2) A return or remittance that is transmitted to the city by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the post office upon the envelope containing it. The director may allow electronic filing of returns or remittances from any taxpayer. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the city electronically shall be deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the director.

(3) If a written request is received prior to the due date, the director, for good cause, may grant, in writing, additional time within which to make and file returns.

(4) The director shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received or refunded. The director shall apply payments first against all penalties and interest owing, and then upon the tax, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer.

(5) For any return not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and shall be subject to the penalties and interest provided in this chapter.

(6) Any payment made that is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for any other reason will not be considered received until payment by certified check, money order, or cash of the original amount due, plus a “nonsufficient funds” (NSF) charge of $40.00 is received by the director. Any license issued upon payment with a NSF check will be considered void, and shall be returned to the director. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the $40.00 NSF fee) is received.

(7) The director is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or fees, when and as due under this chapter. [Ord. 1556 § 8, 2012.]


3.85.090 Records to be preserved – Examination – Estoppel to question assessment.

Every person liable for any fee or tax imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of five years after filing a tax return, such records as may be necessary to determine the amount of any fee or tax for which the person may be liable; which records shall include copies of all federal income tax and state tax returns and reports made by the person. All books, records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other data including federal income tax and state tax returns and reports shall be open for examination at any time by the director or its duly authorized agent. Every person’s business premises shall be open for inspection or examination by the director or a duly authorized agent.

(1) If a person does not keep the necessary books and records within the city, it shall be sufficient if such person (a) produces within the city such books and records as may be required by the director, or (b) bears the cost of examination by the director’s agent at the place where such books and records are kept; provided, that the person electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance to the director the estimated amount thereof including round-trip fare, lodging, meals and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon completion of the examination.

(2) Any person who fails, or refuses a department request, to provide or make available records, or to allow inspection or examination of the business premises, shall be forever barred from questioning in any court action, the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the city for any period for which such records have not been provided, made available or kept and preserved, or in respect of which inspection or examination of the business premises has been denied. The director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. [Ord. 1556 § 9, 2012.]


3.85.100 Accounting methods.

(1) A taxpayer may file tax returns in each reporting period with amounts based upon cash receipts only if the taxpayer’s books of account are kept on a cash receipts basis. A taxpayer that does not regularly keep books of account on a cash receipts basis must file returns with amounts based on the accrual method.

(2) The taxes imposed and the returns required hereunder shall be upon a calendar year basis. [Ord. 1556 § 10, 2012.]


3.85.110 Public work contracts – Payment of fee and tax before final payment for work.

The director may, before issuing any final payment to any person performing any public work contract for the city, require such person to pay in full all license fees or taxes due under this title from such person on account of such contract or otherwise, and may require such taxpayer to file with the director a verified list of all subcontractors supplying labor and/or materials to the person in connection with said public work. [Ord. 1556 § 11, 2012.]


3.85.120 Underpayment of tax, interest, or penalty – Interest.

(1) If, upon examination of any returns, or from other information obtained by the director, it appears that a tax or penalty less than that properly due has been paid, the director shall assess the additional amount found to be due and shall add thereto interest on the tax only. The director shall notify the person by mail of the additional amount, which shall become due and shall be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice, or within such time as the director may provide in writing.

(2)(a) For tax periods prior to December 31, 2004, the director shall compute interest in accordance with RCW 82.32.050 as it now exists or as it may be amended.

(b) For tax periods after December 31, 2004, the director shall compute interest in accordance with RCW 82.32.050 as it now exists or as it may be amended.

3.85.130 Time in which assessment may be made.

The director shall not assess, or correct an assessment for, additional taxes, penalties, or interest due more than four years after the close of the calendar year in which they were incurred, except that the director may issue an assessment:

(1) Against a person who is not currently registered or licensed or has not filed a tax return as required by this chapter for taxes due within the period commencing 10 years prior to the close of the calendar year in which the person was contacted in writing by the director;

(2) Against a person that has committed fraud or who misrepresented a material fact; or

(3) Against a person that has executed a written waiver of such limitations. [Ord. 1556 § 13, 2012.]


3.85.140 Overpayment of tax, penalty, or interest – Credit or refund – Interest rate – Statute of limitations.

(1) If, upon receipt of an application for a refund, or during an audit or examination of the taxpayer’s records and tax returns, the director determines that the amount of tax, penalty, or interest paid is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be credited to the taxpayer’s account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

(2) The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying for, or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the director discovers that a refund or credit is due.

(3) Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the director and by the issuance of a city check or warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the city may provide.

(4) Any final judgment for which a recovery is granted by any court of competent jurisdiction for tax, penalties, interest, or costs paid by any person shall be paid in the same manner, as provided in subsection (3) of this section, upon the filing with the director a certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.

(5)(a) For tax periods after December 31, 2004, the director shall compute interest on refunds or credits of amounts paid or other recovery allowed a taxpayer in accordance with RCW 82.32.060 as it now exists or as it may be amended.

(b) If subsection (5)(a) of this section is held to be invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.060 existing at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply. [Ord. 1556 § 14, 2012.]


3.85.150 Late payment – Disregard of written instructions – Evasion – Penalties.

(1) If payment of any tax due on a return to be filed by a taxpayer is not received by the director by the due date, the director shall add a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(1), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

(2) If the director determines that any tax has been substantially underpaid as defined in RCW 82.32.090(2), there shall be added a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(2), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

(3) If a citation or criminal complaint is issued by the director for the collection of taxes, fees, assessments, interest or penalties, there shall be added thereto a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(3), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

(4) If the director finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the director a license as required by chapter 5.04 DMMC, the director shall impose a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(4), as it now exists or as it may be amended. No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection (4) if the person who has engaged in business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the director of the need to be licensed.

(5) If the director determines that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from the taxpayer’s failure to follow specific written tax reporting instructions, there shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(5), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

(6) If the director finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable, the director shall assess a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(6), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

(7) The penalties imposed under subsections (1) through (5) of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.

(8) The director shall not impose both the evasion penalty and the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions on the same tax found to be due.

(9) For the purposes of this section, “return” means any document a person is required by the city of Des Moines to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the city, and that has a statutorily defined due date.

(10) If incorporation into the Des Moines Municipal Code of future changes to RCW 82.32.090 is deemed invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.090 existing at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter is effective shall apply. [Ord. 1556 § 15, 2012.]


3.85.160 Cancellation of penalties.

(1) The director may cancel any penalties imposed under DMMC 3.85.150(1) if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Willful neglect is presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was, nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, unable to file or pay by the due date. The director has no authority to cancel any other penalties or to cancel penalties for any other reason except as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

(2) A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the director within 30 days after the date the department mails the notice that the penalties are due. The request must be in writing and contain competent proof of all pertinent facts supporting a reasonable cause determination. In all cases the burden of proving the facts rests upon the taxpayer.

(b) Was unaware of its responsibility to file and pay tax; and

(c) Obtained business licenses and filed past due tax returns within 30 days after being notified by the department.

However, data, material, or documents that do not disclose information related to a specific or identifiable taxpayer do not constitute tax information under this section. Nothing in this chapter requires any person possessing data, material, or documents made confidential and privileged by this section to delete information from such data, material or documents so as to permit its disclosure.

However, tax information not received from the taxpayer must not be so disclosed if the director determines that such disclosure would compromise any investigation or litigation by any federal, state, or local government agency in connection with the civil or criminal liability of the taxpayer or another person, or that such disclosure would identify a confidential informant, or that such disclosure is contrary to any agreement entered into by the department that provides for the reciprocal exchange of information with other government agencies which agreement requires confidentiality with respect to such information unless such information is required to be disclosed to the taxpayer by the order of any court;

The application shall contain such information as the city manager may deem necessary or useful, and shall include:

(a) A brief written description of the project and preliminary schematic site and floor plans of the multifamily units and the structure(s) in which they are proposed to be located.

(b) A statement from the property owner(s) acknowledging the potential tax liability for the property when the MFTE ends.

(c) The property owner(s) shall also provide the city with a declaration as to the owner’s interest in the property and identify any other parties with an ownership interest. If someone other than the property owner(s) is developing the property, then the owner shall declare that the developer has authority to speak on behalf of the property owner(s) and to bind the property owner(s) by any representations made by that developer.

(2) At the time of application, the property owner(s) shall pay to the city an initial application fee as established by the city manager to cover the cost of the city’s review of the application and the cost to hire an independent consultant to complete a financial analysis of the economic impacts if the application is approved by the city council. In addition, at the time of application, the property owner(s) shall pay to the city the fee required to cover the county assessor’s administrative costs. If the city council approves the application pursuant to DMMC 3.96.090, the city shall forward the fee for the county assessor’s administrative costs to the county assessor. If the city council denies the application pursuant to DMMC 3.96.090, the city shall refund the fee for the assessor’s administrative costs to the property owner(s).

Within 14 days of receiving additional information, the city manager or designee shall notify the property owner(s) in writing if the application is incomplete, and what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the city manager or designee does not notify the property owner(s) in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete; however, a determination of completeness does not preclude the city manager or designee from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter. Failure to complete the application will be deemed to be an abandonment of the application.

(3) All the conditions of the MFTE agreement between the applicant and the city will be satisfied upon completion of the project; and

(5) The city manager or designee shall notify the property owner(s) in writing that the city will not file a final certificate if the city manager determines that the project was not completed within the required time limitations as set forth in this chapter; or if the city manager determines that the owner’s property is not otherwise qualified under this chapter or if the owner and the city manager cannot agree on the allocation of the value of the improvements allocated to the exempt portion of the new construction in mixed use new construction.

Chapter 5.64 RENTAL HOUSING

Sections

5.64.010    Findings.

5.64.020    Definitions.

5.64.030    Landlord – Duties – Notice by police chief – Infraction.

5.64.040    Assistance – Request – Provision.

5.64.050    Violations – Infraction – Proceedings – Appeals.


5.64.010 Findings.

(1) The citizens of the city have a right to safe rental housing and the city should assist rental property owners and managers to reduce the occurrence of criminal conduct on rental properties. The Des Moines city council finds that it is a reasonable exercise of its police powers to require rental property owners to take reasonable steps to prevent the use of rental property for criminal purposes, and that rental property owners should be penalized in the event they take no action to discourage crime from recurring on their rental properties. The Des Moines city council further finds that increased cooperation between property owners, tenants and the Des Moines police department is integral in reducing such crime.

(2) Existing city laws have proven ineffective in encouraging rental housing property owners who have criminal activity occurring on their property to take the proper steps necessary to help the Des Moines police department in stopping crime.

(3) This chapter has been developed to give the Des Moines police department and rental housing property owners the tools necessary to maintain and improve the safety, quality and appearance of the rental properties they own, and therefore, provide a safer living environment for renters and for the surrounding community.

(4) Enforcement of this chapter through issuance of civil infraction notices as provided in chapter 7.80 RCW and chapter 1.24 DMMC as presently constituted or subsequently amended will use procedures with which the Des Moines police department and the Des Moines municipal court are accustomed. The Des Moines municipal court will conduct hearings on infractions, with a police officer presenting evidence in support of the infraction notice. As provided by RCW 7.80.090, an assistant city attorney may, but need not, appear on behalf of the city. It is anticipated that most cases will not require appearance by an assistant city attorney. [Ord. 1477 § 1, 2010.]

(b) A person or business entity such as a corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership, or agency that owns, operates, or manages rental housing or rental property; and

(c) A person, designated by the landlord, who has authority to sign a lease or rental agreement.

(5) “Reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur on the property” means that the landlord reports criminal conduct that occurs on the property whenever the commission of criminal conduct on the rental property is known or suspected, and that the landlord takes steps to prevent the recurrence of crime, which may include, but are not limited to, one of the following:

(a) The landlord and on-site managers of the rental property show proof of attendance in at least a three-hour landlord training class. Training may be provided by local police departments, rental housing associations, on-line training or any other training program approved by the Des Moines police department. The training must be about rental property management, crime-free properties, tenant screening or landlord-tenant law;

(b) The landlord pursues eviction to judgment of the tenant who is the subject of a notice issued in accordance with DMMC 5.64.030(2), and begins the eviction process within 30 days after the third notice is issued; or

5.64.030 Landlord – Duties – Notice by police chief – Infraction.

(1) A landlord shall ensure that its rental property is not used for criminal conduct. If a landlord is notified by the Des Moines police department that criminal conduct has occurred on the property, the landlord shall take reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will reoccur on the rental property. Repeated criminal conduct committed by tenants or guests on the rental property shall result in a civil infraction chargeable to the landlord.

(2) Upon the occurrence of criminal conduct on the rental property, the police chief’s office may cause notice to be sent to the landlord setting forth the date of the occurrence, the location of the occurrence, the nature of the occurrence and the name of the person who engaged in the criminal conduct. Notice may be sent whenever the police chief’s office has probable cause to believe that criminal conduct has occurred on the rental property. Notice is deemed properly delivered when it is either served upon the landlord or a property manager of the rental property by certified mail to the last known address of the landlord. The issuance of the notice in this subsection is a prerequisite to the issuance of a notice of infraction under subsection (3) of this section, and the issuance of the civil infraction under subsection (3) of this section constitutes the notice of the fourth instance of criminal conduct.

(3) If a landlord receives more than three notices under subsection (2) of this section regarding instances of criminal conduct committed in the same dwelling unit or anywhere on the rental property by the same tenant or any guest of the tenant within any six-month period, the landlord is guilty of a civil infraction if they have not taken reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will reoccur on the rental property. If the criminal conduct is committed by guests of the tenant, the city need not establish that the criminal conduct was committed by the same guest. Each instance of criminal conduct committed in the same dwelling unit or anywhere on the rental property by the same tenant or any guest of the tenant in excess of three instances of criminal conduct in a six-month period is an additional civil infraction chargeable to the landlord. [Ord. 1477 § 3, 2010.]


5.64.040 Assistance – Request – Provision.

(1) A request for the assistance of the city in accordance with this section is considered a reasonable step to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur for the next single violation on the rental property, but only if:

(a) The landlord cooperates with the city’s assistance and takes reasonable measures to implement the suggested methods of the city to reduce the recurrence of criminal conduct on the rental property; and

(b) A request for assistance does not relieve the landlord of the duty to comply with this chapter.

(2) When criminal conduct occurs on rental property, or the occurrence of criminal conduct on the rental property is suspected by the landlord, the landlord may request the assistance of the Des Moines police department in taking steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur on the rental property. The city shall assist landlords when such a request is made. The assistance may include, but is not limited to, the following:

(a) Providing the landlord with disclosable information relating to the criminal conduct that occurred on the rental property;

(b) Having a law enforcement officer communicate with the tenant suspected of engaging in the criminal conduct regarding the ramifications of continued criminal conduct; and

(c) Providing the landlord with resources available to assist the landlord in pursuing eviction of the tenant.

(d) The Des Moines police department may work with other agencies providing advice to rental property owners or tenants in providing assistance under this section. [Ord. 1477 § 4, 2010.]

8.04.240 Termination of occurrence of violation.

Upon the complaint of a person, and after such complaint is verified by the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee, the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee shall commence proceedings to terminate the occurrence of a violation either by service of citation or by the procedure set out in DMMC 8.04.260, as applicable. The standards of this chapter shall be followed by the Chief of Police in determining the existence of an animal control violation and in determining the abatement action required. [Ord. 1599 § 25, 2014.]


8.04.250 Animal declared a public nuisance – Abatement.

An animal that has been the subject of three convictions of a violation of this chapter occurring on separate dates in a period of 365 days or an animal that bites or attacks a person or persons without provocation twice within a five-year period is a public nuisance and shall not be kept within the City. The Chief of Police shall follow the procedures set out in DMMC 8.04.260 in order to abate such animal. After the completion of such abatement procedures, an animal subject to removal from the City as provided in this section that is found within the City shall be impounded and treated as an unredeemed animal with no right of redemption by its owner or keeper. [Ord. 1599 § 26, 2014.]


8.04.260 Abatement of nuisances – Procedure – Appeal.

The following procedure shall apply to the abatement of animals subject to removal, to animals not redeemable because subject to cruelty, and to kennels, pet shops, and shelters in violation of DMMC 8.04.040 through 8.04.120:

(1) Notice shall be directed to the owner or keeper of such an animal by the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee, stating the action to be taken, the basis for action, and the availability of an appeal, as provided in subsection (2) of this section. Such notice shall be served personally, or by postage paid certified mail, return receipt requested, or by posting at the last known residence or place of business of the owner or keeper. Such notice shall constitute a final order unless the owner or keeper files a written notice of appeal within 48 hours of the receipt of the notice or posting of the notice.

(2) An appeal from the notice of abatement of nuisance shall be brought to the Hearing Examiner. Such appeal shall be brought within 10 days of such decision and in accordance with the Hearing Examiner Code; provided, however, that appeal from the decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be directly to King County Superior Court upon a writ of certiorari and within the time provided for appeal to Superior Court from a decision of the City Council under the Hearing Examiner Code. During the pendency of such appeal the animal shall either be confined or, as an alternative, the owner shall post adequate monetary security to guarantee he will confine the animal. The Hearing Examiner shall have the discretion to order either alternative, and shall have discretion to revoke the recognizance should the owner violate any provision thereof. In the event the animal is confined during the appeal to Superior Court, the owner shall, as a condition of such appeal, post a cost bond in an amount equivalent to the cost of maintaining the animal during the pendency of the action in Superior Court. Such bond shall be posted either within 10 days of commencing the action or within 10 days of revocation of the recognizance, such as the case may be.

(3) Failure to fully comply with a final order shall be a misdemeanor and, further, the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee shall be empowered to act to abate such nuisance or cruelty violation and the person failing to comply with such order shall become indebted to the City for all damages, costs, and charges incurred in the removal of such animal. Such damages, costs, and charges shall become a civil debt against the person failing to comply and shall be collectible in the same manner as any other civil debt owing to the City.

(4) Whenever such a public nuisance constitutes or reasonably appears to constitute an imminent or continuing danger to the public, the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee shall have authority to summarily and without notice abate the same by reasonable means. If the subject animal can be safely impounded, the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee shall do so, and the owner or keeper thereof shall become indebted to the City for all damages, costs, and charges incurred during the process of abatement. If the animal cannot be safely impounded, the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee shall have authority to slay such animal. The expense of such abatement shall likewise become a civil debt against the owner or keeper of such animal. Such summary abatement shall not limit criminal prosecution for the original violation. [Ord. 1599 § 27, 2014.]


8.04.270 Additional enforcement.

Notwithstanding the existence or use of any other remedy, the Chief of Police through the City Manager may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin acts or practices and abate conditions that constitute a violation of this chapter or other regulation adopted in this chapter. [Ord. 1599 § 28, 2014.]


8.04.280 Rabies control.

(1) It is unlawful for the owner of an animal when notified that such animal has bitten a person or has injured a person as to cause an abrasion of the skin, to sell, give away, or permit or allow such animal to be taken beyond the limits of the City, except to a veterinary hospital, but it shall be the duty of such owner upon receiving notice of the occurrence of such bite or abrasion to immediately place such animal in a duly licensed veterinary hospital for at least 15 days or to deliver such animal to the police department or their agent for such placement; provided, upon authorization of a licensed veterinarian and the Des Moines Police Department, such animal may be released to the custody of its owner or keeper upon the owner or keeper’s undertaking to keep the same securely chained and confined to the premises of the owner or keeper and segregated from other animals during such observation period. A member of the Police Department or agent thereof receiving such animal shall immediately convey the animal to a veterinary hospital where such animal shall be securely confined for a period of at least 15 days. In case such animal is delivered to a veterinary hospital by the owner or keeper, the owner or keeper shall immediately furnish notice thereof to the Chief of Police. A veterinary hospital, upon the receipt of such animal, shall submit to the Chief of Police a certificate stating that the animal either:

(a) Shows no symptoms of rabies; or

(b) Shows symptoms of rabies.

At the expiration of the 15-day period of confinement and upon release of such animal because not rabid, a veterinary hospital shall submit to the Chief of Police a second certificate stating that the animal has been found not to be rabid and has been released. A licensed veterinarian releasing such animal to its owner or keeper for confinement during the observation period, shall at the end of the 15-day period submit a report to the Chief of Police as to the condition of such animal.

(2) Costs of maintaining an animal in a veterinary hospital shall be paid by the owner.

(3) If a fierce, dangerous, or vicious animal cannot be safely taken up and impounded, such animal may be euthanized by the police department or any of its officers or agents.

(4) In cases where an animal that has bitten a person or caused an abrasion of the skin is euthanized by an officer, and a period of less than 15 days has elapsed since the day the animal bit a person or caused an abrasion of the skin of a person, it is the duty of the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee to contact the laboratory of the State Department of Health for further instruction.

(5) Whenever rabies among dogs becomes prevalent in western Washington or in the county, or whenever western Washington or the county are declared to be under a rabies quarantine, the City Manager may order every dog within the City inoculated, may order all dogs muzzled unless confined within a pen, and may make such other orders as may be necessitated to protect the public from this health hazard. During the time such orders are in force, the Chief of Police and the Chief’s designee may be ordered by the City Manager to euthanize dogs found running at large.

(6) For the purposes of this section, a King County animal control center qualifies as a duly licensed veterinary hospital. [Ord. 1599 § 29, 2014.]

Anyone having in his possession an animal not owned by him, without consent of the lawful owner or custodian, shall immediately notify the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee and release such animal to the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee on demand without charge. [Ord. 1599 § 31, 2014.]


8.04.310 Wild or exotic animals.

(1) No person shall have, keep, or maintain, in an area of the City, a live monkey (nonhuman primate), lion, tiger, bear, cougar, mountain lion, badger, wolf, coyote, fox, lynx, or a venomous reptile or serpent, or any other dangerous, carnivorous, wild, or exotic animal or reptile.

(2) For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

“Exotic” means animals of foreign origin and that are not native by birth to this community.

“Wild” means an animal that generally lives in its original natural state and is not normally domesticated.

(3) Such animals will be allowed to enter or remain in the City on the condition that a permit be obtained from the Des Moines Police Department. Such permit shall only be granted upon a showing by the applicant that adequate safeguards have been instituted and will be maintained which will effectively control the dangerous or vicious propensities of such animal or reptile, eliminating danger to individuals or property and providing that the keeping or maintaining of such animal will in no way constitute a nuisance to the occupants of surrounding property.

(4) No person owning or having charge, custody, control, or possession of an animal specified in subsection (1) of this section shall permit the same to run at large upon any street or other place, public or private or within the premises of such person, in such a manner to endanger a person lawfully entering such premises.

(5) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to a person keeping or maintaining or having in his possession or under his control an animal defined in that subsection when such person is transporting such animal through the City; provided, that he has taken adequate safeguards to protect the public, and has notified the Chief of Police of his proposed route and of the time that such trip is to take place; nor shall subsection (1) of this section apply to a person who has custody of such animals in connection with the operation of a zoo or circus or in connection with a program of medical or scientific research; provided such person has taken adequate measures to safeguard persons and property. Whether measures taken to safeguard the public pursuant to this section are adequate shall be determined solely by the Chief of Police or the Chief’s designee. [Ord. 1599 § 32, 2014.]


8.04.320 Personal obligations.

Civil penalties and costs of abatement incurred by the City are the personal obligations of the animal owner or keeper. The City Attorney may collect such civil penalties and abatement costs by use of appropriate legal remedies. [Ord. 1599 § 33, 2014.]


8.04.330 Violation – Penalty.

(3) A second violation of or failure to comply with this section within a 12-month period with respect to the same animal is a class 3 civil infraction.

(4) A third or subsequent violation of or failure to comply with this section within a 12-month period with respect to the same animal is a class 2 civil infraction; provided, that a third or subsequent violation of or failure to comply with the provisions of DMMC 8.04.210(7) or (8) within a 12-month period with respect to the same animal is a class 1 civil infraction.

(8) Each alarm registration and renewal shall require a signed acknowledgment by the alarm user of the following:

Registration of an alarm system is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response by the City of Des Moines Police Department. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By registering an alarm system, the alarm user acknowledges that police response may be based on many factors, including but not limited to availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, and staffing levels.

(9) Any false statement of a material fact made by an applicant for the purpose of obtaining an alarm registration shall be sufficient cause for refusal to issue or to revoke a registration.

(3) For purposes of enforcing this chapter against an individual residential unit, the tenant is responsible for false alarms emitted from the alarm system in the tenant’s residential unit.

(4) Each apartment unit shall be considered an alarm site. [Ord. 1360 § 4, 2005.]

(4) An alarm user shall have an alarm company inspect the alarm system after two false alarms in a one-year period from the date of registration issuance or renewal. The alarm administrator may waive an inspection requirement if it is determined that a false alarm could not have been related to a defect or malfunction in the alarm system. After four false alarms within a one-year period from the date of registration issuance or renewal the alarm user must have a properly licensed alarm company modify the alarm system to be more false alarm resistant or provide additional user training as appropriate. [Ord. 1360 § 6, 2005.]

(1) Any alarm company that sells, leases, maintains, services, repairs, alters, replaces, moves, installs or monitors an alarm system at an alarm site within the city of Des Moines shall obtain a city of Des Moines business license in accordance with chapter 5.04 DMMC.

(c) Report alarm signals by using telephone numbers designated by the alarm administrator;

(d) Utilize mandatory enhanced call verification for every alarm signal, except a duress and holdup alarm activation, by making a minimum of two calls to attempt to verify an alarm prior to requesting a police response.

(5) The alarm administrator shall oversee the creation and implementation of an alarm user awareness class. The alarm administrator may request the assistance of alarm companies and a law enforcement agency in developing and implementing the class.

9.10.090 Enforcement and penalties.

(1) Application for Permit. A person desiring to give a public display of fireworks shall make an application for a permit to operate the public display, in writing, to the city clerk. Such application shall set forth:

(a) The name of the organization sponsoring the display, together with the names of persons actually in charge of the firing of the display;

(3) Investigation of Site – Certificate of Compliance by the Fire Marshal. Upon receipt of such application, at least 30 days in advance of the date set for the display, the fire marshal shall make an investigation of the site of the proposed display for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of these regulations are complied with in the case of the particular display. If the fire marshal is satisfied that the display is lawful and there has or will be full compliance with the law, the fire marshal shall issue a written recommendation. The recommendation is kept on file in the office of the city clerk and available for review by the hearing examiner. If the fire marshal finds that the permit applicant has complied with the law, the fire marshal may issue a certificate of compliance stating that the fire marshal endorses the display as being in conformance with all parts of the law and with these regulations. For a scheduled public display, applicant shall submit such information as deemed appropriate by the city police department to ensure that adequate traffic control and crowd protection policing has either been arranged through private security agencies or has been contracted for with the city police department. A written notice that the applicant has complied with the requirement is issued by the chief of the city police department before a public display permit is issued. In no event should the sum agreed upon in payment for policing be less than the actual expense incurred by the city in providing that service. Such consideration is calculated for personnel resources using the hourly rate for overtime under the current collective bargaining agreement, plus that percentage then being paid for fringe benefits, and all sums paid under such contract are paid in accordance with procedures specified by the city finance director.

(4) Operator and Assistant. A public display of fireworks shall be handled by at least one state licensed operator and one assistant at least 18 years of age and shall be of such character, and so located, discharged or fired, that, in the opinion of the fire marshal, after proper investigation, it will not constitute a hazard to property or endanger a person.

(5) Licensed Pyrotechnician. All fireworks shall be fired under the direction of a pyrotechnician licensed by the state.

(6) Cash Deposit. A cash deposit in an amount set by written executive order of the city manager shall be posted with the city clerk at least 30 days in advance of the public display date to provide for costs of site cleanup. The deposit is forfeited to the city if the operator fails to perform the cleanup within four days of the public display. If the operator properly performs the cleanup, the deposit is returned to the operator. [Ord. 1362 § 4, 2005.]


9.42.050 Public display permit – Bond or insurance for liability.

(1) The applicant for a permit for a public display of fireworks shall include with the application evidence of a bond issued by an authorized surety company. The bond shall be conditioned upon the applicant’s payment of all damages to persons or property resulting from or caused by the public display of fireworks, or negligence on the part of the applicant or its agents, servants, employees, or subcontractors in the presentation of the display. Instead of a bond, the applicant may include a certificate of insurance evidencing the carrying of appropriate public liability insurance for the benefit of the person named therein as assured, as evidence of ability to respond in damages. The city clerk receiving the application shall approve the bond or insurance if it meets the requirements of this chapter.

(3) If insurance in this amount is not readily available from at least three insurance companies approved by the state, each fireworks permit shall be covered by a liability insurance policy in the maximum amount offered by at least three different state approved insurance companies. [Ord. 1362 § 5, 2005.]


9.42.060 Authority to issue permits and enforce chapter.

These reports are kept in the office of the city clerk and are available for review by the city hearing examiner.

(2) The fire marshal, or the fire marshal’s duly authorized representative, is designated the enforcing officer of this chapter. In addition to all the grounds for revocation of a permit set forth in the general provisions of this chapter, a failure or refusal on the part of a person holding a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter, or a person employed by the permit holder, to obey a rule or request of the fire marshal, or the fire marshal’s duly authorized representative, concerning the manufacture, storage, use, sale, or display of fireworks, is a violation of this chapter and is grounds for the revocation of the fireworks permit.

The following findings and authority shall apply to this chapter:

The City has prepared a study for determining an equitable method for calculating the surface water management service fees for the rate classes as set forth in Appendix A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter. The “Final Report for the Stormwater Rate Structure Study – July 2013,” by FCS Group, complies with RCW 35.67.020 by applying three uniform rates for small, medium, and large single-family properties and a measured rate for single-family properties exceeding 7,500 square feet of impervious surface and a measured rate for all multifamily, commercial and nonprofit properties. The measured rate charge shall be based on per billing unit per 3,450 square feet of impervious surface area. A copy of the rate study, Appendix B attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, shall be kept on file with the City Clerk and is available to the public for review. [Ord. 1574 § 1, 2013.]


11.12.007 Report adopted by reference.

The following is adopted by reference:

The “Final Report for Stormwater Rate Structure Study – July 2013,” is hereby adopted as set forth in Appendix B, which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and incorporated herein by reference. [Ord. 1574 § 2, 2013.]


11.12.010 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter clearly requires otherwise, the words or phrases defined in this section shall have the indicated meanings.

“Commercial property” means: (a) all property in the City, private or public, used for a purpose other than single-family, multifamily, or nonprofit uses; and (b) for the purposes of this chapter, “mixed uses” as defined in the zoning code of the City and nonprofit homes for the aging as that expression is used in chapter 84.36 RCW.

“Developed property” means a property that has been changed from the natural state, resulting in 500 square feet or more of impervious area occurring on the property.

“Development permit” means, for the purposes of this chapter, a required permit leading to a project that will result in 500 square feet or more of new impervious area on previously undeveloped or developed property.

“Development permit charge” means a one-time payment made at the time of development or redevelopment of a property to compensate the City for the costs previously incurred by the City in providing the surface water system serving the property at the time of development.

“Disabled person” means a person who has been granted special parking privileges for disabled persons under RCW 46.16.381 as presently constituted or as may be subsequently amended.

“Equivalent billing unit (EBU)” means a measure of the impact of commercial/multifamily properties on the surface water system. It is equal to each 3,450 square feet of impervious area that has been determined to be the average amount of impervious area on single-family properties in the City.

“Impervious surface or area” means a hard surface area that either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle as it entered under natural conditions prior to development, or that causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow present under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, roofs, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, areas which are paved, graveled or made of packed or oiled earthen materials, or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of surface and storm water. For the purposes of applying impervious surface thresholds and exemptions contained in the King County Surface Water Design Manual, permeable pavement, vegetated roofs, and pervious surfaces with underdrains designed to collect storm water runoff are considered impervious surface while open, uncovered retention/detention facilities are not. However, for the purposes of computing runoff, uncovered flow control or water quality facilities shall be modeled as impervious surfaces as specified in the King County Surface Water Design Manual.

“Multifamily property” means all property zoned and/or used for purposes of multifamily housing. For the purposes of this chapter, trailer parks are considered multifamily property, and “mixed uses” are not considered multifamily property.

“Nonprofit property” means property upon which a facility exists that is owned and operated by a governmental agency or by an organization that has been granted nonprofit status under the rules of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States.

“Nonprofit residential property” means multifamily residential developments or nonprofit homes for the aging, owned and operated by a governmental agency or by an organization that has been granted nonprofit status under the rules of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States.

“Permeable pavement” means pervious concrete, porous asphalt, permeable pavers, or other forms of pervious or porous paving material intended to allow passage of water through the pavement section. Permeable pavement includes an aggregate base or natural soil base that provides structural support and acts as a storm water reservoir. Surfaces referred to as “paved” shall include those covered by permeable pavement.

“Private streets” means tracts of land, not publicly owned, that are generally open to the public in the same manner as public rights-of-way and that serve residential developments, but shall not include driveways or paved surfaces providing vehicle access within a multifamily or commercial development.

“Rate structure study” means the rate study identified in DMMC 11.12.007.

“Single-family unit” means those properties on which one dwelling unit is established, and that unit is used for dwelling purposes and not commercial activity, except for approved home occupations. “Single-family unit” also means an individually owned dwelling unit in planned unit developments (hereinafter “PUD” or “PUDs”), except for condominiums therein.

“Surface water system” means the surface water utility system of the City. [Ord. 1671 § 3, 2017: Ord. 1574 § 3, 2013: Ord. 1246 § 1, 1999: Ord. 1211 § 2, 1998: Ord. 1000 § 1, 1993: Ord. 860 § 1, 1990.]


11.12.020 Service charge established for surface water service.

There is established a system of service charges for surface water drainage service against all developed properties in the City.

(1) Monthly surface water utility rates shall be established on the basis of whether the developed property is used for a single-family unit, multifamily units, commercial properties, or nonprofit properties. Rates for all other surface water goods and services shall be established by executive order of the City Manager and published at the office of the Planning, Building and Public Works Department.

(2) The rates for surface water drainage service shall be as reflected on Appendix “A” attached to the ordinance codified in this section, which is incorporated herein by this reference. The baseline rates contained in Appendix “A” are effective January 1, 2016.   Effective January 1, 2017, and January 1st of each succeeding year thereafter, rates for surface water drainage service shall be established by, first, taking the rate service charge for the previous year (this figure is hereinafter referenced as the “base sum”); second, multiplying the base sum by a combination index of the Engineering News Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (CCI) for the City of Seattle on March 31st of the current year and the Seattle Consumer Price Index (CPI-Urban Consumers), as measured for the 12-month period ending in June of the previous year as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics. The applicable index shall be calculated for the upcoming year as 30 percent of the ENR CCI for Seattle plus 70 percent of the Seattle CPI; and, third, adding the results to the base sum. On January 1st of each succeeding year, the rates shall be established by applying updated CCI, CPI, and the end figures in like manner to the rates of the previous year. Should the combined CCI/CPI inflation index as calculated above be less than zero, then the base sum shall remain the same as the previous year. Effective January 1st, for years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the rates after applying the CCI/CPI index shall be increased by an additional 3.70 percent. Effective January 1st, for years 2020 and 2021, the rates after applying the CCI/CPI index shall be increased by an additional 2.70 percent.

(3) The monthly surface water service charge as applied to new development activity resulting in 500 square feet or more impervious area shall become effective on the date the land was cleared, graded or modified for the development as documented by the Public Works Director. For new subdivisions, the effective date shall be approval date of the plat. [Ord. 1627 § 1, 2015: Ord. 1620 § 1, 2015: Ord. 1574 § 4, 2013: Ord. 1496 § 1, 2010: Ord. 1437 § 1, 2008: Ord. 1368 § 1, 2005: Ord. 1246 § 2, 1999: Ord. 1220A § 1, 1999: Ord. 1173 § 1, 1996; Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994: Ord. 1065 § 1, 1993: Ord. 990 § 1, 1992: Ord. 927 § 1, 1992; Ord. 860 § 2, 1990.]


11.12.030 Charges for development permits.

For properties requesting development permits after January 1, 1991, a development permit is hereby established. The development permit charge reflects the previous costs to the City of providing the storm drainage system serving the property at the time of the request for a development permit. The lack of a physical connection system does not preclude the development permit from this charge. Installation of infiltration systems shall not exempt the property from the development permit charge.

(1) The development permit charge shall be computed on the following basis:

	Development Permit Charge =	Square Footage of Impervious Area to Be Developed on Property x Base Charge

	 	Equivalent Billing Unit

(2) Effective January 1, 2016, the base charge shall be $1,550. 

(3) Effective January 1, 2017, and January 1st of succeeding years, the base charge shall be increased by the ENR CCI for March 31st of the previous year.

(4) The development permit charge shall be computed to the nearest 0.1 EBU.

(5) The minimum development permit charge shall be the base charge. There shall be no development permit charge for expansion or remodeling of single-family units. [Ord. 1620 § 2, 2015: Ord. 1368 § 2, 2005: Ord. 1246 § 3, 1999: Ord. 860 § 3, 1990.]

(a) All storm water facilities shall be inspected at regular intervals and maintained and repaired in accordance with the King County Surface Water Design Manual maintenance requirements, an approved operation and maintenance manual for storm water facilities, or by permits which may be issued by the State Department of Ecology, or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), applicable construction standards, and the minimum requirements as stated in the King County Stormwater Pollution Prevention Manual.

(b) Where maintenance and repair is necessary to correct health or safety problems, to prevent harmful materials from entering the storm water system, or to remove harmful materials that have entered the storm water system, such work shall be completed by the owner or operator of the storm water system or storm water facility within 24 hours of discovery of the need for maintenance or repair. When maintenance and repair is found necessary to prevent water quality degradation, such work shall be completed within 14 calendar days of discovery of the need for maintenance or repair. For other related problems, maintenance or repairs shall be completed within 30 calendar days of discovery or repair.

(c) Where lack of maintenance is causing or contributing to a water quality problem, immediate action shall be taken to correct the problem. Within one month, the director or his or her designee shall revisit the facility to assure that it is being maintained.

(d) Should the director have reasonable cause to believe that the situation at a private storm water facility is so adverse or hazardous so as to preclude written notice, he or she may take the measures necessary to eliminate the hazardous situation; provided, that he or she shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner before acting. In such instances the owner of the property and/or the person responsible for the maintenance of the facility shall be obligated for the payment of all costs incurred. If costs are incurred and a bond pursuant to this chapter or other city requirement has been posted, the director shall have the authority to collect against the bond to cover costs incurred.

(e) Illicit discharges to the storm water system are prohibited, unless such discharges are authorized in accordance with chapter 173‑216 WAC (State Waste Discharge Permit Program) or chapter 173-220 WAC (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program).

(f) Harmful and prohibited materials, as defined in this section, shall not be allowed to enter any storm water system. All such substances shall be stored, handled and disposed in a manner that will prevent them from entering the storm water system. Further, storage, handling and disposal shall be conducted in accordance with chapters 173-303 and 173-304 WAC.

(4) Disposal of Waste from Maintenance Activities. Disposal of waste from maintenance activities shall be conducted in accordance with the Minimum Functional Standards for Solid Waste Handling, chapter 173-304 WAC, guidelines for disposal of waste materials from storm water maintenance activities, and, where appropriate, the Dangerous Waste Regulations, chapter 173-303 WAC.

(5) Administration.

(a) Inspection Program.

(i) The director shall develop and implement a program and procedures for the regular inspection of all public and private storm water facilities in Des Moines. As part of that program, or whenever there is probable cause to believe that a violation of this chapter or article has been or is being committed, the director (or his or her designated inspector) is authorized to inspect all public and private portions of the storm water drainage systems within Des Moines during regular working hours and at other reasonable times to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

(ii) As part of the inspection program, the director shall establish a master inspection and maintenance schedule. Inspections shall be annual, at a minimum. Critical storm water facilities may require a more frequent inspection schedule. If, during an inspection, a facility is found not to be in compliance with the standards as described in this chapter, all subsequent inspection and maintenance intervals shall be scheduled more frequently if determined by the director to be necessary in order to assure future compliance. If, during the course of the inspection program, additional existing storm water facilities are discovered, they shall be added to the master inspection and maintenance schedule.

(b) Entry to Storm Water Facilities. Prior to making any inspections, the director or designated inspector shall present identification credentials, state the reason for the inspection and request entry.

(i) If the property or any building or structure on the property is unoccupied, the director or designated inspector shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person(s) having charge or control of the property or portions of the property and request entry.

(ii) If after reasonable effort, the director or designated inspector is unable to locate the owner or other person(s) having charge or control of the property, and has reason to believe the condition of the storm water drainage system creates a risk of imminent harm to persons or property, the inspector may enter.

(iii) If entry is not consented to by the owner or person(s) in control of the property or portion of the property, and no conditions are reasonably believed to exist which create a risk of imminent harm, the director shall obtain a search warrant as authorized by the laws of the state of Washington.

(iv) The director or designated inspector may also inspect the storm water drainage system without obtaining a search warrant, provided the inspection can be conducted while remaining on public property or other property on which permission to enter is obtained.

(6) Inspection and Maintenance Records.

(a) Records for New Facilities. Records of new public or private storm water facilities shall include the following:

(i) As-built plans and locations.

(ii) Findings of fact for any exemption granted by the city of Des Moines.

(iii) Operations and maintenance requirements and records of inspections, maintenance actions and frequencies.

(iv) Engineering reports, if prepared prior to or during construction of the facility.

(b) Records for Existing Facilities. Upon the request of the director or designated inspector, all owners of existing storm drainage systems shall provide the director with all inspection, maintenance and repair records for their facilities, as well as any existing record drawings or diagrams of their storm drainage systems. [Ord. 1463 § 2(8), 2009.]


11.20.090 Violations and enforcement.

Whenever the city finds that an owner/operator has violated or failed to meet a requirement in any provision of this chapter, the city may pursue the code enforcement procedures set forth in chapter 1.28 DMMC. Any violation of this chapter that is deemed by the director to be a threat or potential threat to the public health, safety and welfare may be abated as a nuisance or pursuant to any other applicable local, state or federal law or regulation. Regulation under this chapter shall not serve as a shield to any action under other applicable laws or regulations of the city, state, or United States. [Ord. 1463 § 2(9), 2009.]

12.05.030 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter, in order to protect the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare, to provide for the issuance of right-of-way use permits to regulate activities within the right-of-way in the City, provide for the maintenance of the right-of-way and provide for the fees, charges, warranties, and procedures required to administer the permit process. [Ord. 1578 § 18, 2013.]


12.05.040 Authority.

Rights-of-way permits shall be issued by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director or approved by the City Council as is set forth in DMMC 12.05.060. [Ord. 1578 § 19, 2013.]

(3) The Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall examine each application submitted for review and approval to determine if it complies with the applicable provisions of this chapter and procedures adopted under this chapter. Other departments that have authority over the proposed use or activity may be required to review and approve or disapprove the application. The Planning, Building and Public Works Director may inspect the right-of-way proposed for use to determine any facts which may aid in determining whether a permit should be granted. If the Planning, Building and Public Works Director finds that the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter and procedures adopted under this chapter, that the proposed use of such right-of-way will not unduly interfere with the rights and safety of the public, and if the application has not been disapproved by a department with authority, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may approve the permit, and may impose such conditions thereon as are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, welfare, and safety and to mitigate any impacts resulting from the use.

(5) Upon submittal of a completed application, the Planning, Building and Public Works Department shall collect from the applicant an application fee in the amount set forth in the current fee schedule adopted by the City Manager. [Ord. 1578 § 21, 2013.]


12.05.070 Permit fees and charges.

The fee for each permit shall be set forth in a fee schedule to be adopted by the City Manager.

(2) Daily Use Fee. All permits shall include a fee for each day (or part thereof) of use of the right-of-way. The fee will compensate the City for monitoring and inspecting the site.

(3) Large Structure Move Charges. When a permit allowing a large structure to be moved over the City’s right-of-way is issued, the City shall impose an additional charge based on the actual cost to compensate for its time and expense. These costs may include the costs for street crews, signal crews, and police, if required to assist in the move. A minimum fee will be established and charged at the time of such permit issuance.

The presence of the Planning, Building and Public Works Director during the performance of an excavation work shall not relieve the permittee of its responsibilities under this chapter.

12.05.250 Duty to maintain clean rights-of-way.

This chapter shall apply to property owners constructing real property improvements unless specifically excepted by the City’s Street Development Standards, adopted by chapter 12.15 DMMC. Persons constructing real property improvements are responsible for street system improvements to the extent those street system improvements do not exist at the time of building permit application. [Ord. 1578 § 61, 2013.]


12.20.030 Purpose.

It is the intent and policy of this chapter that all persons constructing “real property improvements” on lots abutting public rights-of-way are responsible for street system improvements, constructed in accordance with the “City of Des Moines Street Development Standards,” and the provisions of this chapter, on public rights-of-way adjacent to such lots, and in limited circumstances, on public rights-of-way which connect to a paved street surface. The fundamental principle of this chapter is that the owner, developer, and/or building permit applicant for proposed real property improvements is responsible for constructing street system improvements as defined in this chapter, or paying a street system improvement fee in lieu of construction as provided for in this chapter. [Ord. 1578 § 62, 2013.]

(1) General Obligation. As a condition of building permit approval, the developer shall construct street system improvements in accordance with this chapter.

(2) Payment of Street System Improvement Fee in Lieu of Construction, Based upon Anticipated Public Development. If the Planning, Building and Public Works Director finds that a required street system improvement will be destroyed, altered or otherwise made obsolete due to development plans of the City or another governmental entity within six years, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may require the developer make an in-lieu cash payment to the City. As determined by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director, the cash payment shall be based on the estimated cost of the improvements plus engineering and administrative costs. If the anticipated public project does not occur, the City will complete the improvements required under this chapter. [Ord. 1578 § 64, 2013.]


12.20.060 All development sites shall be served by paved streets.

All development sites shall be served by a paved street surface which connects to an existing paved street surface. [Ord. 1578 § 65, 2013.]


12.20.070 Development sites fronting unpaved street surface.

(2) Upon the timely filing by the owner of the subject property of written objections to the disconnection and removal of the service lines, the Hearing Examiner shall be directed to conduct a public hearing to determine whether the removal of all or part of the overhead service lines is in the public benefit. The Hearing Examiner shall schedule the public hearing within 45 days of receipt of the owner’s written objection.

(3) Notice of the public hearing is given by publication in the official newspaper of the City not less than 14 days prior to the scheduled hearing date and by mailing an appropriate notice, by certified mail, not less than 14 days of the hearing date to the owner of record and to the occupant/tenant of real property which may be affected by the proceedings.

This chapter is created pursuant to RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.090. [Ord. 1578 § 117, 2013.]


12.40.050 Findings and authority.

The City Council hereby finds and determines that development activities, including but not limited to new residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial development in the City will create additional transportation demand and need for public facilities in the City, and the City Council finds that such new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of new transportation facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. The City has conducted extensive research and analysis documenting the procedures for measuring the impact of new developments on public facilities, and has prepared a “Rate Study for Transportation Impact Fees, City of Des Moines,” dated August 17, 2009 (“rate study”). The rate study utilizes a methodology for calculating impact fees that fulfills all of the requirements of RCW 82.02.060(1). A copy of the rate study shall be kept on file with the City Clerk and is available to the public for review. Therefore, pursuant to chapter 82.02 RCW, the Council adopts this chapter to assess transportation impact fees for streets and roads. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of the Council in establishing the transportation impact fee program. [Ord. 1578 § 118, 2013.]

12.40.080 Transportation impact fees established.

There is established, subject to the provisions of this chapter, a transportation impact fee program. [Ord. 1578 § 121, 2013.]


12.40.090 Establishment of service area.

(1) The City hereby establishes, as the service area for transportation impact fees, the City, including all property located within the corporate limits of the City.

(2) The scope of the service area is hereby found to be reasonable and established on the basis of sound planning and engineering principles, and consistent with RCW 82.02.060. [Ord. 1578 § 122, 2013.]


12.40.100 Imposition of transportation impact fees on development activity.

(1) The City hereby authorizes the assessment and collection of transportation impact fees on development activity within the City, based on the methodology described in the rate study. The maximum allowable transportation impact fee rate established by the rate study is $6,380. Instead of setting the base rate at this level, the base rate for the calendar year 2016 is established at $5,151.21 per new p.m. peak hour trip. The base transportation impact fee rate is subject to annual adjustment in accordance with subsection (5) of this section. Accordingly, using the methodology described in the rate study, the Department will annually update the fee schedule identified in the rate study, and make the fee schedule available for public use.

(2) The collection of transportation impact fees will be modified for those subareas of the Pacific Ridge Zone that are also subject to SEPA mitigation fees pursuant to Exhibit B of Ordinance No. 1298, as presently written or as subsequently amended or revised.2

(3) Transportation impact fee rates are based upon the formula for calculating the proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements, including the costs of previously constructed system improvements, necessitated by new development to be borne by transportation impact fees, which formulas are described in the rate study.

(4) The City Council may review the base transportation impact fee rate set forth in subsection (1) of this section at any time the City Council deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the update of the capital facilities element of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, and the Council may adjust the transportation impact fee base rate as the Council deems just and appropriate, up to the maximum rate identified in the rate study.

(5) The Planning, Building and Public Works Department will annually adjust the transportation impact fee base rate based on the construction cost index for the Seattle area as reported in the Engineering News Record periodical, typically in March.

(6) For a change in use of an existing building or dwelling, including any alteration, expansion, replacement or new accessory living quarters, the net transportation impact fees shall be the applicable transportation impact fees calculated for the land use category of the new use, reduced by an amount equal to the current transportation impact fees calculated for the prior use.

(7) No reduction based on prior use shall be made for a vacant structure or a vacant property that once contained a structure if the structure or property had been vacant for more than 10 years.

(8) For mixed use developments, transportation impact fees shall be imposed for the proportionate share of each applicable land use.

(9) The transportation impact fees imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be assessed by the City. A preliminary assessment will be provided by the Department during the review and approval of a given development activity, typically a building permit application or a permit for a change in land use. A final assessment, based upon the transportation impact fee rate in effect as of the date the actual permit is issued, shall be made by the Department, and the fee shall be due and payable in full at the time of issuance of the permit. Failure to pay the transportation impact fees for a given development activity at the time that such transportation impact fees are due and payable shall result in denial of the permit for which the applicant has applied.

(10) Development activities that have been allowed credits prior to the submittal of the complete building permit application or an application for a permit for a change in land use shall submit, along with the complete application, a copy of the letter or certificate issued by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director pursuant to DMMC 12.40.130 setting forth the dollar amount and basis of the approved credit. The net transportation impact fees, as determined after the reduction of appropriate credits, shall be collected from the applicant in accordance with subsection (9) of this section.

(11) Where the transportation impact fees imposed are determined by the square footage of the development, the Department may at its discretion or at the written request of the feepayer review the constructed development prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or an occupancy permit to confirm that the square footage of the constructed development is consistent with the square footage used to determine the final assessment and payment of the transportation impact fee. If the final square footage of the development is in excess of the square footage used to determine the final assessment and payment of the transportation impact fee, any difference will be due prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or an occupancy permit, using the transportation impact fee rate in effect at that time. If the final square footage is less than the square footage used to determine the final assessment and payment of the transportation impact fee, the Department shall give a refund for the difference. [Ord. 1659 § 2, 2016: Ord. 1588 § 1, 2013: Ord. 1578 § 123, 2013.]


12.40.110 Independent calculations.

(1) If in the judgment of the Planning, Building and Public Works Director none of the land use categories or fee amounts set forth in the rate study or the Department’s fee schedule accurately describes or captures the impacts of a new development on roads, the Department may conduct independent calculations and the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations. The alternative fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the feepayer.

(2) A feepayer may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the Department’s fee schedule identified in DMMC 12.40.100(1), in which case the feepayer shall prepare and submit to the Planning, Building and Public Works Director an independent calculation for the development activity for which a permit is being sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent calculation was made. An independent calculation shall use the same methodology used to establish the transportation impact fee set forth in the rate study, shall be limited to adjustments in trip generation rates and lengths used in the rate study, and shall not include travel demand forecasts, trip distribution, transportation service areas, costs of road projects, or cost allocation procedures.

(3) Any feepayer submitting an independent calculation will be required to pay the City a fee to cover the cost of reviewing the independent calculation. The fee required by the City for conducting the review of the independent calculation shall be $500.00, unless otherwise established by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee, and shall be paid by the feepayer prior to initiation of review.

(4) There is a rebuttable presumption that the calculations set forth in the rate study and the fees set forth in the Department’s fee schedule are valid. The Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer, but is not required to accept such documentation or analysis which the Planning, Building and Public Works Director reasonably deems to be inapplicable, inaccurate, or not reliable. The Planning, Building and Public Works Director may require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The Planning, Building and Public Works Director is authorized to adjust the transportation impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. The fees or alternative fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the feepayer.

(5) Determinations made by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeal procedures set forth in DMMC 12.40.160. [Ord. 1578 § 124, 2013.]


12.40.120 Exemptions.

(1) Except as provided for below, the following shall be exempted from the payment of transportation impact fees:

(a) Alteration or replacement of an existing structure that does not expand the usable space, add any residential units or generate any additional p.m. peak trips.

(b) Miscellaneous improvements which do not generate increased p.m. peak trips, including, but not limited to, fences, decks, walls, residential swimming pools, and signs.

(c) Demolition or moving of a structure when additional p.m. peak hour trips are not generated.

(d) A change of use that does not generate one or more p.m. peak hour trips.

(2) The Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall be authorized to determine whether a particular development activity falls within an exemption identified in this section or under other applicable law. Determinations of the Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall be in writing and shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in DMMC 12.40.160. [Ord. 1578 § 125, 2013.]


12.40.130 Credits for dedications and construction of improvements.

(1) A feepayer can request that a credit or credits for the value of system improvements, including dedications of land, improvements and/or construction provided by the feepayer, be applied toward the calculated transportation impact fee. The application for credits shall be presented by the feepayer on forms to be provided by the Department and shall include the content designated in such forms. Credits will be given only if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are:

(a) Included within the capital facilities plan or would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan; and

(b) Are at suitable sites and constructed at acceptable quality as determined by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director; and

(c) Serve to offset impacts of the feepayer’s development activity; and

(d) Are for one or more of the transportation projects listed in the rate study as the basis for calculating the transportation impact fee.

(2) The transportation impact fee program shall provide credits for mitigation fees imposed under the State Environmental Policy Act (RCW 43.21C.060) and chapter 16.05 DMMC for system improvements identified in the comprehensive transportation plan as “intersection and roadway capacity improvement projects for the traffic impact fee program.”

(3) The Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall determine if requests for credits meet the criteria in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, or under other applicable law. Determinations of the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may be appealed pursuant to DMMC 12.40.160.

(4) Each request for a credit or credits shall include a legal description of the dedicated land, a detailed description of improvements or construction provided, and a legal description or other adequate description of the development to which the credit will be applied.

(5) For each request for a credit or credits, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall determine the value of the dedicated land, improvements, or construction on a case-by-case basis.

(6) In the event that the feepayer disagrees with the Planning, Building and Public Works Director’s valuation of the dedicated land, the feepayer may submit an appraisal for the Planning, Building and Public Works Director’s consideration, prepared by a state certified MAI (member of the American Institute of Appraisers) in accordance with the most recent version of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. In the event that that feepayer disagrees with the Planning, Building and Public Works Director’s valuation of improvements or construction provided, the feepayer may submit a valuation for the Planning, Building and Public Works Director’s consideration, prepared by a licensed engineer. The appraiser and/or engineer must be licensed and in good standing pursuant to chapter 18.43 RCW et seq., in the category for the property and/or improvements to be appraised/valued, and shall not have a fiduciary or personal interest in the property being appraised.

(7) Appraisals and/or engineering valuations submitted by the feepayer shall be subject to review by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director and, at the Planning, Building and Public Works Director’s discretion, an independent review appraiser/engineer selected by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director. The feepayer shall pay for the actual costs for the appraisal/valuation and the independent review. An estimate of the appraisal and review costs will be prepared by the Department, and the feepayer shall pay the estimated costs prior to commencement of the appraisal and review. If the final cost of the appraisal and review is in excess of the initial estimate and payment, any difference will be due prior to the issuance of a letter or certificate from the Planning, Building and Public Works Director. If the final cost of the appraisal and review is less than the initial estimate and payment, the Department shall give a refund for the difference.

(8) After receiving and reviewing the appraisal, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of any credit, the reason for the credit, the legal description of the real property dedicated where applicable, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The feepayer must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate, and return such signed document to the Planning, Building and Public Works Director before the impact fee credit will be applied. The failure of the feepayer to sign, date, and return such document within 60 calendar days shall nullify the credit. If credit is denied, the feepayer shall be notified in a letter that includes the reasons.

(9) If the total value of any credit for such dedication, improvement or construction costs exceeds the amount of the transportation impact fee obligation, the developer will not be entitled to reimbursement of the difference.

(10) No credit shall be given for project improvements.

(11) Any claim for credit must be made no later than 14 calendar days after the submission of an application for a building permit or an application for a permit for a change in use. The failure to timely file such a claim shall constitute a final bar to later request any such credit.

(12) Determinations made by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in DMMC 12.40.160. [Ord. 1578 § 126, 2013.]


12.40.140 Disposition of transportation impact fee revenues.

(1) The transportation impact fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be deposited into a transportation impact fee fund. Pending application as provided in this chapter, the moneys deposited in the transportation impact fee fund shall be invested in any investment authorized for the investment of City funds. All interest and profits derived from the investment of moneys in each account in the transportation impact fee fund shall be retained in such account.

(2) The transportation impact fees deposited in each account in the transportation impact fee fund and the interest and profit received from the investments therefrom shall be expended only for system improvements for which such transportation impact fees were collected, in conformity with the City Comprehensive Plan and comprehensive transportation plan, and expended or encumbered within six years of receipt by the City, unless written findings by the City Council identify an extraordinary and compelling reason for the City to hold the fees for a longer time. The City shall account for annual expenditures and shall comply with this section in successive comprehensive plans, transportation plans and capital facilities plans as appropriate.

(3) The transportation impact fees may also be used to recoup system improvement costs previously incurred by the City to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs.

(4) In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of system improvements for which transportation impact fees may be expended, transportation impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development.

(5) The City shall prepare an annual report on the transportation impact fee fund which shows the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received and the public facilities that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. [Ord. 1578 § 127, 2013.]


12.40.150 Refunds.

(1) The City shall, in accordance with RCW 82.02.080, refund to the current owners of property on which a transportation impact fee has been paid any transportation impact fees paid with respect to such property that has not been expended or encumbered for public facilities of the type of which such transportation impact fees were collected.

(2) The City shall also refund to the current owner of property on which a transportation impact fee has been paid all transportation impact fees paid with respect to such property if the development activity for which the transportation impact fee was imposed did not occur and no impact has resulted.

(3) If some, but not all, of the development activity for which the transportation impact fee was imposed occurred, the transportation impact will be deemed to have occurred, and no refund will be payable; provided, however, that the property on which the transportation impact fee was paid shall be eligible to receive a credit toward any subsequent development activity on the property up to the full amount of the payment.

(4) Owners seeking a refund of transportation impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of transportation impact fees to the Planning, Building and Public Works Director or designee within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises, which, for purposes of refund claims authorized pursuant to subsection (2) of this section only, shall be the date of voluntary or involuntary abandonment of the permit, or the date that notice is given as provided in subsection (1) of this section, whichever occurs later. Refunds of transportation impact fees shall not include interest or any profits earned on the transportation impact fees from the date of their receipt to the date of refund. Any transportation impact fees not expended within the time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within the one-year claim period, shall be retained by the City and expended on system improvements for which such transportation impact fees were initially collected, without further limitation as to the time of expenditure. [Ord. 1578 § 128, 2013.]


12.40.155 Deferred payment of impact fees.

Impact fees required in this chapter may be deferred as provided in Title 3 DMMC. [Ord. 1657 § 2, 2016.]


12.40.160 Appeals.

(1) The determination of the Planning, Building and Public Works Director or designee regarding the applicability of the transportation impact fee to a given development activity within the service area shall be final; however, an owner may pay a transportation impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter under protest in order to obtain a permit and, after such payment, file an appeal regarding the amount of the transportation impact fee or a determination made pursuant to DMMC 12.40.110, 12.40.120 or 12.40.140 to the Hearing Examiner pursuant to DMMC 18.20.150 and 18.20.160 and chapter 18.240 DMMC.

(2) Appeal regarding the amount of the transportation impact fee imposed on any development activity may only be made by the owner of the property where such development activity shall occur. [Ord. 1578 § 129, 2013.]


12.40.170 Existing authority unimpaired.

Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the City from requiring the applicant to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the underlying development approval process, and/or chapter 58.17 RCW governing plats and subdivisions; provided, that the exercise of this authority is consistent with the provisions of chapters 43.21C and 82.02 RCW. [Ord. 1578 § 130, 2013.]


12.40.180 Administrative guidelines.

12.65.020 Application.

This chapter shall apply to the development traffic calming measures in the right-of-way. [Ord. 1578 § 166, 2013.]


12.65.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to address neighborhood concerns with regard to traffic safety issues. These issues include, but are not limited to, reducing the problems of accidents, nonlocal traffic, spillover parking, and vehicles speeding on residential streets. The procedures established by this chapter enable citizens and/or community groups to participate in the problem identification, planning, design, implementation, and evaluation stages of projects meant to remedy traffic safety problems. [Ord. 1578 § 167, 2013.]


12.65.040 Authority.

The Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall have the power to prepare and adopt procedures as needed to implement the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 1578 § 168, 2013.]


12.65.050 Coordination.

The program is coordinated by the Planning, Building and Public Works Department with other Departments and agencies, including:

(1) The Police Department to ensure overall traffic safety and the best use of resources for target enforcement of traffic speeds in neighborhoods by the City Police Department.

(2) Fire and emergency services to ensure minimal impact on emergency access routes and response times.

(3) School districts and King County Metro Transit to coordinate safe walking routes for students, to identify and correct specific safety problems around schools, and to minimize impacts on school and public bus operation.

(4) Other jurisdictions to ensure consistency in traffic control devices and procedures on the streets that cross through multiple jurisdictions. [Ord. 1578 § 169, 2013.]


12.65.060 Program guidelines.

The administrative rules published by the Planning, Building and Public Works Department shall contain provisions to implement the following guidelines:

(1) Locations for proposed installation of traffic calming devices are prioritized to ensure that funds are spent on the most serious locations first.

(2) Neighborhood residents are responsible for the initiation and follow-through of individual traffic calming projects. Placing the burden for project initiation on the public shall:

(a) Discourage frivolous requests;

(b) Minimize staff time spent in evaluating problem locations; and

(c) Build a neighborhood consensus before City funds are spent.

(3) Except for unusual situations, traffic speed enforcement through the City Police Department or a speed watch program should usually be the initial response to a petition requesting neighborhood traffic calming.

(4) Use the least restrictive traffic calming strategy/device that will solve the specific problem. Passive techniques should be explored before deciding to install physical devices. Passive techniques should include a range of possible solutions including brush trimming, improving sight distances, posting appropriate traffic control signs, speed watch programs, traffic enforcement, traffic safety campaigns, and any other techniques deemed appropriate by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director.

(5) If physical devices are necessary, the least intrusive or restrictive types of devices should be evaluated first. Physical devices can include speed humps, traffic circles, chicanes, traffic diverters, turn prohibitors, curb extensions, and any other techniques deemed appropriate by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director.

(6) Manage traffic in place rather than diverting it to another location. In some cases, through traffic should be on nearby arterials and physical devices would be appropriate to try to divert such traffic back to the arterial system. However, traffic should not be relocated from one neighborhood street to another.

(7) Use the most cost-effective traffic calming devices to solve identified problems so that City resources can be used to address as many locations as possible. [Ord. 1578 § 170, 2013.]


12.65.070 Minimum criteria.

(1) Neighborhood traffic calming projects should meet all of the following minimum criteria:

(a) Average daily traffic (“ADT”) volumes should be greater than 500 ADT but less than 4,000 ADT.

(b) Traffic speed studies with a sample of at least 50 cars in each direction at a given location should show at least 20 percent of the vehicles exceeding the posted speed limit by at least five miles per hour.

(c) The street under consideration for a traffic calming project is not classified as an arterial. [Ord. 1578 § 171, 2013.]


12.65.080 Neighborhood corridor projects.

Neighborhood corridor projects focus attention on larger-scale neighborhood projects to address nonlocal traffic and pedestrian safety. Projects of this type are considered when the neighborhood traffic safety problem is determined to be caused by a lack of adequate arterial facilities and sidewalks in the problem area.

The types of projects include: installing sidewalks, curbs, and gutters, and improving the capacity of the street by doing channelization and/or signalization improvements. Projects of this nature are prioritized under the six-year transportation plan. [Ord. 1578 § 172, 2013.]

(e) If an affected employer has already performed a baseline measurement, or an alternative acceptable to the City, under previous iterations of this chapter, the employer is not required to perform another baseline measurement.

(2) Newly Affected Employers.

(a) Employers meeting the definition of “affected employer” in this chapter must identify themselves to the City within 90 days of either moving into the boundaries outlined in the CTR Plan adopted in DMMC 12.70.040 or growing in employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees. Employers who do not identify themselves within 90 days are in violation of this chapter.

(b) Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given 90 days to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the City. Employers who do not perform a baseline measurement within 90 days of receiving written notification that they are subject to this chapter are in violation of this chapter.

(c) Not more than 90 days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement, the newly affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR Program to the City. The program will be developed in consultation with the Planning, Building and Public Works Director to be consistent with the goals of the CTR Plan adopted in DMMC 12.70.040. The program shall be implemented not more than 90 days after approval by the City. Employers who do not implement an approved CTR Program according to this schedule are in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties outlined in DMMC 12.70.120(4).

(3) Change in Status as an Affected Employer. Any of the following changes in an employer’s status will change the employer’s CTR program requirements:

(a) If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees and expects not to employ 100 or more affected employees for the next 12 months, that employer is placed on a 12-month watch and are subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers. At the end of the 12-month watch, if they no longer employ 100 affected employees, they are no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to provide documentation to the City that they are no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the City that it is no longer an affected employer. The burden of proof lies with the employer.

(b) If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.

(c) If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an “unaffected” employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers. [Ord. 1584 § 6, 2013.]

(n) Provision of a program of parking incentives such as a rebate for employees who do not use the parking facilities;

(o) Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part- or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes which reduces commute trips;

(p) Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules, such as a compressed work week, which reduces commute trips;

(q) Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities, emergency taxi services, or guaranteed ride home programs;

(r) Charging employees for parking, and/or the elimination of free parking; and

(s) Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site.

(3) CTR Program Report and Description. Affected employers shall review their program and file a regular progress report with the City in accordance with the format provided by the City.

The CTR Program Report and Description outlines the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for the reporting period. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other to implement program elements.

At a minimum, the employer’s CTR Program Report and Description must include:

(a) A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services;

(b) The number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the site;

(4) Biennial Measure of Employee Commute Behavior. In addition to the mandatory baseline measurement, employers shall conduct a program evaluation as a means of determining worksite progress toward meeting CTR goals. As part of the program evaluation, the employer shall distribute and collect Commute Trip Reduction Program Employee Questionnaires (surveys) at least once every two years, and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from employees at the worksite. [Ord. 1584 § 10, 2013.]


12.70.100 Record keeping.

Affected employers shall maintain a copy of their approved CTR Program Description and Report, their CTR Program Employee Questionnaire results, and all supporting documentation for the descriptions and assertions made in any CTR report to the City for a minimum of 48 months. The City and the employer shall agree on the record keeping requirements as part of the accepted CTR program. [Ord. 1584 § 11, 2013.]


12.70.110 Schedule and process for CTR Program description and report.

(1) Document Review. The City shall provide the employer with written notification if a CTR program is deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or biennial report within 90 days of submission, the employer’s program or annual report is deemed accepted. The City may extend the review period up to 90 days. The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.

(2) Schedule. Upon review of an employer’s initial CTR program, the City shall establish the employer’s regular reporting date. This report will be provided in a form provided by the City consistent with DMMC 12.70.090(3).

(3) Modification of CTR Program Elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to the City for modification of CTR requirements. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exist:

(a) The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or

(b) The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.

(4) Extensions. An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR Program Description and Report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice at least 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days shall be considered for reasonable causes. The City shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s biennial reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the City.

(5) Implementation of Employer’s CTR Program. Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than 90 days after receiving written notice from the City that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period without receiving notice from the City.

(c) Distributing and collecting the CTR Program Employee Questionnaire during the scheduled survey time period.

(2) Program Modification Criteria. The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of drive-alone trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications:

(a) If an employer meets either or both goals, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to improve its CTR program;

(b) If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but has not met the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal, no additional modifications are required;

(c) If an employer fails to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable drive-alone or VMT reduction goal, the City shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR Program Description and Report, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. The City shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, the City will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the City within 10 working days of the conference.

(3) Violations. The following constitute violations if the deadlines established in this chapter are not met:

(4) Penalties.

(a) No affected employer with an approved CTR program which has made a good faith effort may be held liable for failure to reach the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal;

(b) Each day of failure to implement the program shall constitute a separate violation, subject to penalties as described in DMMC 1.24.190(2).

(c) An affected employer shall not be liable for civil penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. Unionized employers shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if they:

(i) Propose to a recognized union any provision of the employer’s CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and

(ii) Advise the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by the City and advise the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with state law (RCW 70.94.531). [Ord. 1584 § 13, 2013.]

(1) Worksite Exemptions. An affected employer may request the City to grant an exemption from all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular worksite. The employer must demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its work force, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if and only if the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of drive-alone trips and VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by the City at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program. The City shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The City shall review annually all employers receiving exemptions, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

(2) Employee Exemptions. Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a worksite’s CTR program. Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. The City will use the criteria identified in the CTR Board Administrative Guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. The City shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The City shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

(3) Modification of CTR Program Goals.

Such requests shall be filed in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the worksite is required to submit its program description or biennial report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the worksite is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The worksite must also demonstrate that it has implemented all of the elements contained in its approved CTR program.

(b) The City will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR Board Guidelines.

(c) An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one year after City approval of its initial program description or biennial report. [Ord. 1584 § 14, 2013.]

14.20.010 Title.

This chapter shall be entitled “Land Filling, Clearing and Grading Code.” [Ord. 1581 § 53, 2013.]


14.20.020 Application.

This chapter shall apply to all grading, excavating or fill, or the authorization of each, not expressly excluded by DMMC 14.20.180. [Ord. 1581 § 54, 2013.]


14.20.030 Purpose.

(1) These regulations are adopted for the following purposes:

(a) To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens;

(b) To preserve and enhance the City’s physical and aesthetic character by preventing indiscriminate removal or destruction of trees, soils, or ground cover within designated environmentally critical areas and shoreline areas;

(c) To promote land development practices that result in a minimal disturbance to the City’s vegetation and soils;

(d) To minimize surface and subsurface water runoff volumes and to prevent erosion-sedimentation and reduce the risk of slides and other unstable conditions;

(e) To minimize the need for additional storm drainage facilities;

(f) To promote the retention of clusters of trees for the abatement of noise and wind protection as well as site stability maintenance;

(g) To acknowledge that trees and ground cover reduce air pollution by producing pure oxygen from carbon dioxide; and reduce storm water runoff by intercepting, evapotranspiring, and retaining rainwater in the soils surrounding their root systems;

(h) To promote building and site planning practices that are consistent with the City’s natural topographical and vegetational features while at the same time recognizing that certain factors such as condition (e.g., disease, danger of falling, etc.), proximity to existing and proposed structures and improvements, interference with utility services, and the realization of a reasonable enjoyment of property may require the removal of certain trees and ground cover;

(i) To ensure prompt development, restoration and replanting, and effective erosion and sedimentation control of property during and after land clearing, grading, or filling through the use of phase development, performance bonds, and other reasonable controls;

(j) To reduce degradation of streams and other water bodies located in and adjacent to the City via scouring, siltation, and water pollution;

(k) To implement the goals and objectives of the State Environmental Policy Act and the water quality standards set forth by the State Department of Ecology; and

(l) To implement and further the City’s Comprehensive Plan.

(2) It is not the intent or purpose of this chapter to prevent the reasonable development of land in the City. [Ord. 1671 § 9, 2017; Ord. 1611 § 14, 2014: Ord. 1581 § 55, 2013.]

(2) Fills. Unless otherwise recommended in the soils report and approved by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee, fills shall conform to the following provisions:

(a) The ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, top soil, and any other unsuitable materials (oversized rock, concrete slabs, tree stumps, brush, and old car bodies, etc.) and scarifying the ground to provide a bond with the fill material.

(b) Fill material shall not include organic, frozen or other deleterious materials. No rock or similar irreducible material greater than 12 inches (305 mm) in any dimension shall be included in fills.

(c) All fill material shall be compacted to 90 percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557, Modified Proctor, in lifts not exceeding 12 inches (305 mm) in depth.

(d) The slope of fill surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for the intended use. Fill slopes steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (50 percent) shall be justified by soils reports or engineering data.

(3) Erosion/Sedimentation Control. All disturbed areas, including faces of cut and fill slopes, shall be prepared and maintained to control erosion/sedimentation in accordance with the specifications of the surface water design manual.

(4) Setbacks. The crests and toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from property boundaries by at least 25 feet to prevent damages resulting from surface runoff or erosion-sedimentation from the slopes. The top and the toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from structures by at least one-half the height of the slope plus 25 feet for adequacy of foundation support and to prevent damages resulting from surface runoff or erosion-sedimentation of the slopes.

(5) Excavations to Water-Producing Depth. All excavations must be made to a water-producing depth or grade to permit natural drainage. The excavations made to a water-producing depth shall be reclaimed in the following manner:

(a) Depth of the excavation must not be less than two feet measured below the low-water mark.

(b) All banks shall be sloped to the water line no steeper than 2:1.

(c) In no event shall the term “water-producing depth” be construed to allow stagnant or standing water to collect or remain in the excavations.

(6) Bench Terrace. Benches at least 10 feet in width shall be back-sloped and shall be established at no more than 10-foot vertical intervals to control surface drainage and debris. Swales or ditches on benches shall have a maximum gradient of one percent.

(7) Hazardous Conditions. Signs warning of hazardous conditions, if such exist, shall be affixed at clearly visible locations.

(8) Fencing. Where required by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee to protect life, limb, and property, fencing shall be installed with lockable gates which must be closed and locked when the site is not being attended. The fence must be no less than five feet in height and the fence material shall have no horizontal opening larger than two inches.

(9) Drainage. Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water or seepage from damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping face of a fill and to carry surface waters that are or might be concentrated as a result of a fill or excavation to a natural watercourse or other means as approved by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee.

(10) Drainage Review. All development activities shall make provisions for drainage pursuant to the requirements of the surface water design manual.

(11) All operations, conditions, and standards of performance shall be subject to the limitations as per required permits.

(12) Environmentally Critical Areas. Any land clearing, grading, or filling activity in an environmentally critical area as defined in Title 16 DMMC is prohibited except for activity conducted in connection with a development exception approved in accordance with the requirements of chapter 16.10 DMMC. [Ord. 1581 § 67, 2013.]


14.20.160 Fees.

There shall be a fee assessed to compensate the City for the expense of reviewing and processing plans, conducting inspections, providing for outside consulting services, and the like. The fee shall be set by written administrative directive and shall be related to the amount of anticipated service for the particular application. Fees for permits authorized under this chapter that are reviewed after the proposed site work has started will be assessed at twice the normal rate. [Ord. 1581 § 68, 2013.]


14.20.170 Bonds and escrow.

The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may require bonds in such form and amounts as may be deemed necessary to assure that the work, if not completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, will be corrected. In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may elect to establish a cash escrow account with his bank in an amount deemed by the code official to be sufficient to reimburse the City if it should become necessary for the City to enter the property for the purpose of correcting and/or eliminating conditions relating to soil stability or aesthetic blight. The bond or escrow shall be in an amount of the estimated cost of correcting or eliminating the condition, including but not limited to the cost of restoring soil stability, eliminating drainage or erosion problems, or removal of blight and restoration and replanting of the property either in accordance with the terms of the permit or to restore the property as nearly as possible to its condition prior to the clearing or filling. The bond or escrow may be increased by the code official in accordance with this chapter. [Ord. 1581 § 69, 2013.]


14.20.180 Exemptions.

Applicants must receive a written letter of exemption from the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee before commencing with the exempted work. Exemption from the permit requirements of this chapter shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of this Code or any other laws or ordinances of this jurisdiction.

(2) Seasonal moorage rates for 20-, 24- and 28-foot slips at the Des Moines Marina will apply for new tenants signing moorage agreements after March 31st of any year and shall continue through October 31st of that year, at which time the rates shall revert to the regular posted rate and remain at that rate as long as the tenant retains their moorage.

(3) Effective January 1, 2016, annual moorage prepayment rates for 20-, 24-, and 28-foot slips will apply for any new or current tenant in those moorages that pays for one year’s (12 months) moorage in advance. The moorage rate for annual tenants that terminate their moorage before the end of the 12-month period will be recalculated at the monthly rate before the balance, if any, is refunded.

(4) The baseline for rates for general moorage berths, seasonal rates in the 20-, 24-, and 28-foot slips, annual rates for the 20-, 24-, and 28-foot slips, and dry shed storage shall be as reflected on Appendix “A”* of the ordinance codified in this section which is incorporated herein by this reference. The baseline rates contained in Appendix “A” shall take effect January 1, 2016.

(5) Persons using the marina facilities shall pay in full all applicable state and federal taxes imposed by statute including the State Leasehold Excise Tax (chapter 82.29A RCW) as adopted by the City in Ordinance No. 387, passed by the City Council April 15, 1976, and codified in chapter 3.72 DMMC as presently constituted or as may be subsequently amended.

(6) Persons using the marina facilities shall pay for all electricity and other utilities or services which shall be furnished to their berth at the established rates provided by the applicable schedule of rates posted by the City.

(7) Formula to Establish Future Rates. The baseline for rates for general moorage, annual moorage, and seasonal moorage in the 20-, 24- and 28-foot slips and dry shed storage shall be the rates contained in Appendix “A”* attached to the ordinance codified in this section. These rates will be used to calculate total moorage due as set forth in Marina Rules 5.0 and 5.2 on January 1, 2016. On the first day of January of each succeeding year, rates for all moorage berths and dry shed storage shall be established by application of the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton, Washington area, for the preceding 12-month period ending August 31st, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (hereinafter, “CPI”). Rates to be effective on January 1, 2017, shall be established by multiplying the baseline rates contained in this section by the CPI percentage published for the period ending August 31, 2016, and adding the results to the baseline rate. In no event shall the amount added to the baseline rates be less than zero. Rates effective on the first day of January of each succeeding year shall be established by applying the CPI in a like manner to the rates of the previous year.

ARTICLE VI. GUEST MOORAGES


15.04.490 Requisites for guest moorage.

All vessels moored at the marina shall have a valid guest moorage permit, an in-force marina service agreement, or an authorized sublet arrangement; provided, that if the marina office is closed at the time of the vessel’s arrival and no authorized agent is in attendance, such permit shall be obtained as soon as possible from the harbormaster. [Ord. 466 § 7(A), 1979.]


15.04.500 Use of another’s berth.

It is unlawful at any time for a person or persons to moor or attempt to moor a vessel in a berth allocated to another. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of record of a vessel is responsible for any such unlawful moorage. [Ord. 466 § 7(B), 1979.]


15.04.510 Impoundment – Authority – Generally.

The harbormaster may impound a vessel found in violation of the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 1011 § 5, 1993: Ord. 466 § 7(C), 1979.]

ARTICLE VII. IMPOUNDING – POWERS AND PROCEDURES


15.04.520 Impound procedures authorized, notification.

(1) In addition to the specific authority granted to the harbormaster in accordance with this chapter, the harbormaster may adopt procedures authorizing marina personnel to take reasonable measures, including the use of chains, ropes, and locks, or removal from the water, to secure vessels within the moorage facility so that the vessels are in the possession and control of the harbormaster and cannot be removed from the moorage facility. These procedures may be used if an owner mooring or storing a vessel at the moorage facility fails, after being notified that charges are owing and of the owner’s right to commence legal proceedings to contest that such charges are owing, to pay the port charges owed or to commence legal proceedings. Notification shall be by certified mail to the owner at the owner’s last known address. In the case of a transient vessel, or where no address was furnished by the owner, the harbormaster need not give such notice prior to securing the vessel. At the time of securing the vessel, an authorized marina employee shall attach to the vessel a readily visible notice. The notice shall be of a reasonable size and shall contain the following information:

(a) The date and time the notice was attached;

(b) A statement that if the account is not paid in full within 90 days from the time the notice is attached, the vessel may be sold at public auction to satisfy the port charges; and

(c) The address and telephone number where additional information may be obtained concerning release of the vessel.

(2) After a vessel is secured, the harbormaster shall make a reasonable effort to notify the owner by registered mail in order to give the owner the information contained in the notice. [Ord. 1011 § 6, 1993. Prior: Ord. 466 § 8(A), 1979.]


15.04.530 Nuisance vessels, procedure authorized.

The harbormaster may move moored vessels ashore for storage within properties under the harbormaster’s control or for storage with private persons under their control and bailees of the moorage facilities, if the vessel is, in the opinion of the harbormaster, in danger of sinking or creating other damage, or is owing port charges. Cost of such procedures is paid by the vessel’s owner. [Ord. 1011 § 7, 1993. Prior: Ord. 466 § 8(B), 1979.]


15.04.540 Release to owner, notification and sale.

(1) If a vessel is secured under DMMC 15.04.520 or moved ashore under DMMC 15.04.530, the owner who is obligated to the marina for port charges may regain possession of the vessel by:

(a) Making arrangements satisfactory with the harbormaster for the immediate removal of the vessel from the moorage facility or for authorized moorage; and

(b) Making payment to the marina of all port charges, or by posting with the marina a sufficient cash bond or other acceptable security to be held in trust by the harbormaster pending written agreement of the parties with respect to payment by the vessel owner of the amount owing, or pending resolution of the matter of the charges in a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction. After entry of judgment, including appeals in a court of competent jurisdiction, or after the parties reach agreement with respect to payment, the trust shall terminate and the marina shall receive so much of the bond or other security as is agreed, or as is necessary to satisfy any judgment, cost, and interest as may be awarded to the harbormaster. The balance shall be refunded within five working days to the owner at the owner’s last known address.

(2) If a vessel has been secured by the harbormaster under DMMC 15.04.520 or 15.04.530 and is not released to the owner under the bonding provisions of this section or under other arrangements satisfactory to the harbormaster, within 90 days after notifying or attempting to notify the owner under DMMC 15.04.520, the vessel is conclusively presumed to have been abandoned by the owner.

(3) If a vessel moored or stored at a moorage facility is abandoned, the harbormaster may, by resolution of the city council, authorize the public sale of the vessel to the highest and best bidder for cash as follows:

(a) Before the vessel is sold, the owner of the vessel shall be given at least 20 days’ notice of the sale in the manner set forth in DMMC 15.04.520 if the name and address of the owner is known. The notice shall contain the time and place of the sale, a reasonable description of the vessel to be sold, and the amount of port charges owned with respect to the vessel. The notice of sale shall be published at least once, but not more than 20 days before the sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in King County. Such notice shall include the name of the vessel, if any, the last known owner and address, and a reasonable description of the vessel to be sold. The marina may bid all or part of the port charges at the sale and may become a purchaser at the sale;

(b) Before the vessel is sold, a person seeking to redeem an impounded vessel under this section may commence a lawsuit in the superior court of King County to contest the validity of the impoundment or the amount of the port charges owing. Such a lawsuit must be commenced within 10 days of the date the notification was provided pursuant to DMMC 15.04.520, or the right to a hearing is deemed waived and the owner is liable for any port charges owing the marina. In the event of litigation, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs;

(c) The proceeds of a sale under this section shall first be applied to the payment of port charges. The balance, if any, shall be paid to the owner. If the owner cannot in the exercise of due diligence be located by the harbormaster within one year of the date of the sale, the excess funds from the sale shall revert to the Department of Revenue pursuant to chapter 63.29 RCW as presently constituted or as may be subsequently amended. If the sale is for a sum less than the applicable port charges, the marina is entitled to assert a claim for a deficiency;

(d) In the event no one purchases the vessel at a sale, or a vessel is not removed from the premises or other arrangements are not made within 10 days of sale, title to the vessel will revert to the city. [Ord. 1011 § 8, 1993. Prior: Ord. 466 § 8(C), 1979.]

ARTICLE VIII. RULES AND REGULATIONS – AUTHORITY AND ENFORCEMENT


15.04.550 Authority to promulgate rules and regulations.

The city manager may issue written rules and regulations, which shall be known as Rules and Regulations of the marina. Such rules and regulations shall govern the relationship of the marina to its customers and the public at large. As to customers of the marina, such rules and regulations shall constitute an extension and supplement to a contract entered into between the marina and its customers. The city manager may delegate authority to promulgate rules and regulations to the harbormaster. Nothing contained in this section shall diminish any authority of the harbormaster to issue special oral or written orders relative to the safe and efficient operation of the marina.

16.01.050 Definitions.

As used in this Title, unless the context or subject matter clearly requires otherwise, the words or phrases defined in this section shall have the indicated meanings.

“Alteration of watercourse” means any action that will change the location of the channel occupied by water within the banks of any portion of a riverine waterbody.

“Aquifer” means a consolidated or unconsolidated ground water-bearing geologic formation or formations that contain enough saturated permeable material to yield significant quantities of water to wells.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated Zone AO, AH, AR/AO or AR/AH (or VO) on a community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. Also referred to as the “sheet flow area.”

“Area of special flood hazard” or “special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR (V, VO, V1-30, VE). “Special flood hazard area” is synonymous in meaning with the phrase “area of special flood hazard.”

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also referred to as the “100-year flood”). Designated on flood insurance rate maps by the letters A or V.

“Base flood elevation (BFE)” means the elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Bluff” means a steep slope which abuts and rises from Puget Sound. Bluffs contain slopes predominantly in excess of 40 percent, although portions may be less than 40 percent. Bluffs occur in the area north of South 222nd Street and south of South 232nd Street. The toe of the bluff is the beach of Puget Sound. The top of a bluff is typically a distinct line where the slope abruptly levels out. Where there is no distinct break in slope, the slope is either the line of vegetation separating the unvegetated slope from the vegetated uplands plateau or, when the bluff is vegetated, the point where the bluff slope diminishes to less than 15 percent.

“Breakaway walls” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

“Buffer” means either: an area adjacent to hillsides which provides the margin of safety through protection of slope stability, attenuation of surface water flows and landslide, seismic, and erosion hazards reasonably necessary to minimize risk to the public from loss of life, well-being, or property damage resulting from natural disasters; or an area adjacent to a stream or wetland which is an integral part of the stream or wetland ecosystem, providing shade; input of organic debris and coarse sediments; room for variation in stream or wetland boundaries; habitat for wildlife; impeding the volume and rate of runoff; reducing the amount of sediment, nutrients, and toxic materials entering the stream or wetland; and protection from harmful intrusion to protect the public from losses suffered when the functions and values of stream and wetland resources are degraded.

“Building” means any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or occupancy, as well as any structure having a roof, but excluding all forms of vehicles even though immobilized. When a use is required to be within a building, or where special authority granted pursuant to this Title requires that a use shall be within an entirely enclosed building, then the term “building” means one so designed and constructed that all exterior walls of the structure shall be solid from the ground to the roof line, and shall contain no openings except for windows and doors which are designed so that they may be closed.

“Building setback line” means a line beyond which the footprint or foundation of a building shall not extend.

“Certified arborist” means an individual who has achieved a level of knowledge in the art and science of tree care through experience and by passing a comprehensive examination administered by the International Society of Arboriculture or urban forestry program.

“Clearing” means the destruction and removal of vegetation by burning, mechanical, or chemical methods.

“Closed record appeal” means an administrative appeal on the record to a local government body or officer, including the legislative body, following an open record hearing on a project permit application when the appeal is on the record with no or limited new evidence or information allowed to be submitted and only appeal argument allowed.

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on the FIRM as Zone V1-30, VE or V.

“Commercial and recreational shellfish areas” means areas that include all public and private tidelands or bedlands suitable for shellfish harvest, including shellfish protection districts established pursuant to chapter 90.72 RCW.

“Compensation” means the replacement, enhancement, or creation of an undevelopable environmentally critical area equivalent in functions, values, and size to those being altered or lost from development.

“Creation (establishment)” means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics present to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site where a wetland did not previously exist. “Establishment” results in a gain in wetland acres. Activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod, create hydric soils, and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species.

“Critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs)” mean those areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water, as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2). CARAs have prevailing geologic conditions associated with infiltration rates that create a high potential for contamination of ground water resources or contribute significantly to the replenishment of ground water. Aquifer recharge areas shall be rated as having high, moderate, or low susceptibility based on soil permeability, geologic matrix, infiltration, and depth to water as determined by the criteria established by the state Department of Ecology.

These areas include but are not limited to the following:

(a) Wellhead Protection Areas. Wellhead protection areas may be defined by the boundaries of the 10-year time of ground water travel or boundaries established using alternate criteria approved by the Washington State Department of Health in those settings where ground water time of travel is not a reasonable delineation criterion, in accordance with WAC 246-290-135.

(b) Sole Source Aquifers. Sole source aquifers are areas that have been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

(c) Susceptible Ground Water Management Areas. Susceptible ground water management areas are areas that have been designated as moderately or highly vulnerable or susceptible in an adopted ground water management program developed pursuant to chapter 173-100 WAC.

(d) Special Protection Areas. Special protection areas are those areas defined by WAC 173-200-090.

(e) Moderately or Highly Vulnerable Aquifer Recharge Areas. Aquifer recharge areas that are moderately or highly vulnerable to degradation or depletion because of hydrogeologic characteristics are those areas delineated by a hydrogeologic study prepared in accordance with the state Department of Ecology guidelines.

(f) Moderately or Highly Susceptible Aquifer Recharge Areas. Aquifer recharge areas moderately or highly susceptible to degradation or depletion because of hydrogeologic characteristics are those areas meeting the criteria established by the state Department of Ecology.

“Critical areas” includes the following areas and ecosystems: (a) wetlands; (b) areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water; (c) fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas; (d) frequently flooded areas; and (e) geologically hazardous areas. “Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas” does not include such artificial features or constructs as irrigation delivery systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or drainage ditches that lie within the boundaries of and are maintained by a port district or an irrigation district or company. RCW 36.70A.030(5).

“Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include (but are not limited to) schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

“Developable area” means the “site area” less the following areas:

“Restoration, wetlands” means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland. For the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres, restoration is divided into:

(a) “Re-establishment” means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland. Re-establishment results in a gain in wetland acres (and functions). Activities could include removing fill material, plugging ditches, or breaking drain tiles.

(b) “Rehabilitation” means the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland. Rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres. Activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or return tidal influence to a wetland.

“Retaining wall” means any wall used to resist the lateral displacement of any material.

“Seismic hazard areas” means those areas subject to severe risk of earthquake damage as a result of seismically induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface faulting. One indicator of potential for future earthquake damage is a record of earthquake damage in the past. Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage in Washington. The strength of ground shaking is affected primarily by:

(a) The magnitude of an earthquake;

(b) The distance from the source of an earthquake;

(c) The type of thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and

(d) The type of subsurface geologic structure.

Settlement and soil liquefaction conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless, loose, or soft-saturated soils of low density usually in association with a shallow ground water table. Known seismic hazard areas are mapped in the “Washington State Department of Natural Resources, Geologic Map GM-41, Liquefaction Susceptibility for the Des Moines and Renton 7.5-minute Quadrangles, Washington,” and “Washington State Department of Natural Resources, Geologic Map GM-43, Liquefaction Susceptibility for the Auburn and Poverty Bay 7.5-minute Quadrangles, Washington.”

“Slope” means an inclined ground surface, the inclination of which is expressed as a ratio (percentage) of vertical distance to horizontal distance by the following formula:

 

	vertical distance	 	x 100 = % slope

	horizontal distance	 

Another method of measuring the inclination of the land surface is by measuring the angle, expressed in degrees, of the surface above a horizontal plane. The following chart shows the equivalents between these two methods of measurement for several slopes:

	Percent Slope	Angle of Inclination

	8.7	5.0°

	15.0	8.5°

The content and scope of required special environmental studies shall be as specified by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species” means those fish and wildlife species native to the state of Washington identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, that are in danger of extinction, threatened to become endangered, vulnerable, or declining and are likely to become endangered or threatened in a significant portion of their range within the state without cooperative management or removal of threats. State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are periodically recorded in WAC 232-12-014 (state endangered species) and WAC 232-12-011 (state threatened and sensitive species). The state Department of Fish and Wildlife maintains the most current listing and should be consulted for current listing status.

“State priority habitats and areas associated with state priority species” means those areas considered priorities for conservation and management. Priority species require protective measures for their perpetuation due to their population status, sensitivity to habitat alteration, and/or recreational, commercial, or tribal importance. Priority habitats are those habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species. A priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type or dominant plant species, a described successional stage, or a specific structural element. Priority habitats and species are identified by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.

“Stream” means an area where surface waters flow sufficiently to produce a defined channel or bed. A defined channel or bed is indicated by hydraulically sorted sediments or the removal of vegetative litter or loosely rooted vegetation by the action of moving water. Stream channels or beds show clear evidence of the passage of water and include, but are not limited to, bedrock channels, gravel beds, sand and silt beds, and defined channel swales. The channel or bed need not contain water year-round. This definition is not meant to include irrigation ditches, canals, storm or surface water runoff devices, or other entirely artificial watercourses unless they are used by salmonids or used to convey streams naturally occurring prior to construction. Swales, which are shallow drainage conveyances with relatively gentle side slopes and generally with flow depths less than one foot, shall be considered streams when hydrologic and hydraulic analyses done pursuant to a development proposal predict formation of a defined channel after development. To differentiate between levels of stream and marine shoreline protection and the application of development standards, streams are classified according to the Washington State Department of Natural Resources Forest Practices Board water typing system specified in WAC 222-16-030 as follows:

(a) “Type S water” means all waters inventoried as “shorelines of the state,” including periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands, under chapter 90.58 RCW and the rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 90.58 RCW;

(b) “Type F water” means segments of natural waters other than Type S waters, which contain fish or fish habitat, including waters diverted for use by a federal, state or tribal fish hatchery from the point of diversion for 1,500 feet or the entire tributary if the tributary is highly significant for protection of downstream water quality;

(c) “Type Np water” means all segments of natural waters that are not Type S or F waters. These are perennial nonfish habitat streams that are physically connected to Type S or F waters by an aboveground channel system, stream or wetland. Perennial streams are waters that do not go dry any time of a year of normal rainfall. However, for the purpose of water typing, Type Np waters include the intermittent dry portions of the perennial channel below the uppermost point of perennial flow;

(d) “Type Ns water” means all segments of natural waters that are not Type S, F, or Np waters. These are seasonal, nonfish habitat streams in which surface flow is not present for at least some portion of a year of normal rainfall and are not located downstream from any stream reach that is a Type Np water. Ns waters must be physically connected by an aboveground channel system to Type S, F, or Np waters.

“Storage tank” means a container for the storage of a gas or liquid.

“Stream corridor” means a perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral stream including its channel bottom, lower and upper banks, area beyond the top of the upper bank which influences the stream and is influenced by the presence of water, and the vegetation inhabiting this area. This area is known as the “riparian zone” which is an area transitional between aquatic and terrestrial (upland) ecosystems having distinct vegetation and soil characteristics. Riparian zones are most commonly recognized by bottomland, flood plain, and streambank vegetation. In developed watersheds, portions of the stream corridor may currently be in a partially culverted or channelized condition by artificial conveyance systems.

“Structure” means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground as well as a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct previously identified existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

(b) Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“Upper bank” is that portion of the topographic cross-section of a stream which extends from the break in the general slope of the surrounding land to the normal high water line.

“Use” means the nature of the occupancy, the type of activity, or the character and form of improvements to which land is devoted or may be devoted.

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this Title that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Title.

“Vegetation” means the general plant life and the ground cover provided by plants, including trees.

“Water dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry that cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations.

“Wetland” or “wetlands” means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, waste water treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created for nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

To differentiate between levels of wetland protection and the application of development standards, wetlands shall be rated according to the “Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington” (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-29, October 2014) or as revised by the Department of Ecology. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists at the time of the adoption of this chapter or as it exists at the time of an associated permit application. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications.

(a) Category I. Category I wetlands represent a unique or rare wetland type, are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands, are relatively undisturbed and contain some ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime, or provide a very high level of functions.

(vii) Wetlands that perform functions at high levels.

(b) Category II. Category II wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide high levels of some functions. These wetlands occur more commonly than Category I wetlands, but they still need a relatively high level of protection. Category II wetlands are:

(i) Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or those that are disturbed and larger than one acre;

(ii) Wetlands with a moderately high level of functions;

(iii) Interdunal wetlands larger than one acre.

(c) Category III. Generally, wetlands in this category may have been disturbed in some way and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. Category III wetlands are:

(i) Wetlands with a moderate level of functions;

(ii) Can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project; or

(iii) Interdunal wetlands between one-tenth and one acre in size.

(d) Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that should be replaceable, and in some cases may be improved. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree.

This chapter shall apply to legislative and other actions affecting the quality of the environment as set forth in chapter 43.21C RCW and chapter 197-11 WAC. [Ord. 1583 § 13, 2013.]


16.05.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement chapter 43.21C RCW and the applicable Washington Administrative Code provisions. [Ord. 1583 § 14, 2013.]


16.05.040 Authority.

The City adopts this chapter under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), RCW 43.21C.120 and the SEPA rules, WAC 197-11-904. This chapter contains this City’s SEPA procedures and policies. The SEPA rules, chapter 197-11 WAC, and chapter 43.21C RCW, must be used in conjunction with this chapter. [Ord. 1688 § 1, 2017: Ord. 1583 § 15, 2013.]


16.05.050 General – Requirements.

The City adopts by reference the definitions contained in WAC 197-11-040 through 197-11-268. [Ord. 1583 § 16, 2013.]

16.05.070 Designation of responsible official.

(1) For those proposals for which the City is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the Community Development Director.

(2) For all proposals for which the City is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the “lead agency” or “responsible official” in accordance with chapter 197-11 WAC.

(3) The City shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules and make them available in accordance with chapter 42.56 RCW. [Ord. 1688 § 2, 2017: Ord. 1583 § 18, 2013.]


16.05.080 Lead agency – Determination and responsibilities.

(1) The department within the City receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050, 197-11-253, and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940; unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

(2) When the City is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the City shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. The responsible official shall not prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the City may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

(3) If the City or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the City must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the City shall be initiated by the responsible official.

(4) The responsible official is authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

(5) The responsible official making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal.

(6) When the City is the lead agency for a MTCA remedial action, the Department of Ecology shall be provided an opportunity under WAC 197-11-253(5) to review the environmental documents prior to the public notice being provided. If the SEPA and MTCA documents are issued together with one public comment period under WAC 197-11-253(6), the City shall decide jointly with Ecology which agency receives the comment letters and how copies of the comment letters will be distributed to the other agency. [Ord. 1583 § 19, 2013.]


16.05.090 Lead agency – Transfer to state agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the City would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the City’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the City shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the City’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the City shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. [Ord. 1583 § 20, 2013.]


16.05.100 Document schedule.

For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal shall accompany the City’s staff recommendation. [Ord. 1583 § 21, 2013.]


16.05.110 Categorical exemptions – Threshold determinations.

The City adopts WAC 197-11-300 through 197-11-390 by reference as supplemented in this chapter. [Ord. 1583 § 21, 2013.]


16.05.120 Use of exemptions.

(1) Each department within the City that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The City shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

(2) In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental license required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

(3) If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the City may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

(a) The City shall not give authorization for:

(i) Any nonexempt action;

(ii) Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or

(iii) Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives.

(b) The responsible official may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

(c) The responsible official may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. [Ord. 1583 § 22, 2013.]


16.05.130 Environmental checklist.

(1) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a completed environmental checklist in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960 shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the City and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The City shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and for making the threshold determination.

(2) For private proposals, the City will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For City proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

(3) The City may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

(a) The City has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

(b) The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.

(4) The City may request that the applicant include supplemental studies with the environmental checklist if the responsible official determines that such studies are necessary to adequately assess the environmental impacts of a proposal. If mutually agreed to by the City and the applicant, supplemental studies may be contracted for directly by the City and funded by the applicant using the procedures set forth in DMMC 16.10.070, Special studies required.

(5) For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the City shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with or as part of a planned action ordinance; or developed after the ordinance is adopted. In either case, a proposed modified environmental checklist form must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a 30-day review prior to use. [Ord. 1583 § 23, 2013.]


16.05.140 Mitigated DNS.

(1) As provided in this chapter and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

(2) An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

(a) Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

(b) Precede the City’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

(3) The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 15 working days. The response shall:

(a) Be written;

(b) State whether the City currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the City to consider a DS; and

(c) State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

(4) As much as possible, the City should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

(5) When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the City shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

(a) If the City indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the City shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

(b) If the City indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the City shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

(c) The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes, or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific.

(d) Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

(6) A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355, which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application.

(7) Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the City.

(8) If the City’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the City should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).

(9) The City’s written response under subsection (3) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the City to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. [Ord. 1583 § 24, 2013.]


16.05.150 Environmental impact statements.

The City adopts WAC 197-11-400 through 197-11-460 by reference, as supplemented by this chapter. [Ord. 1583 § 25, 2013.]

Before the City issues an EIS, the responsible official shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter and chapter 197-11 WAC.

(2) The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be the responsibility of City staff. The Planning, Building and Public Works Department shall contract with consultants as necessary for the preparation of an EIS. The cost of preparing an EIS shall be borne entirely by the applicant. If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that someone other than the City will prepare the EIS, the responsible official shall notify the applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall notify the applicant of the City’s procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution.

(3) Consultants or subconsultants selected by the City to prepare environmental documents for a private development proposal shall not:

(a) Act as agents for the applicant in preparation or acquisition of associated underlying permits; or

(b) Have a financial interest in the proposal for which the environmental document is being prepared; or

(c) Perform any work or provide any services for the applicant in connection with or related to the proposal; or

(d) Perform, contract for, or agree to perform any other work or provide any other services for the applicant while working on the environmental documents for the proposal.

(4) The Planning, Building and Public Works Department shall establish and maintain one or more lists of qualified consultants who are eligible to receive contracts for preparation of environmental documents. Separate lists may be maintained to reflect specialized qualifications or expertise. When the Planning, Building and Public Works Department requires consultant services to prepare an EIS, the applicant shall select two or three candidates from the appropriate consultant list(s) and submit the names of those candidates to the Planning, Building and Public Works Department for consideration to prepare the EIS. The Planning, Building and Public Works Department shall interview the candidate consultants, select the most qualified consultant and negotiate a contract for services. In the event that two or more of the candidate consultants are qualified to prepare the EIS, the Planning, Building and Public Works Department will negotiate with each consultant and select the consultant who can prepare the EIS at the lowest cost to the applicant. The Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall promulgate administrative rules that establish processes to:

(a) Create and maintain a qualified consultant list;

(b) Add consultants to the list; and

(c) Remove consultants from the list. [Ord. 1583 § 26, 2013.]

Whenever the City issues a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2), a mitigated DNS under WAC 197-11-350(3), or a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3), the public notice of these actions shall be given as follows:

(1) Signs Required for Site-Specific Proposals. Applicants shall post one or more large signs on the subject property giving public notice of a proposed action as set forth in this subsection.

(a) Size. All signs shall be four feet by eight feet in size.

(i) Single-Family Residential Zone. All signs shall be two feet by four feet in size.

(ii) All Other Zones. All signs shall be four feet by eight feet in size.

(b) Number of Signs. One public notice sign shall be required per street frontage. In case of large parcels or street frontages exceeding 500 feet, the SEPA Official may require the posting of additional signs.

(c) Location. Signs shall be located on the site of the proposed action, set back at least 10 feet from a public right-of-way or private road or easement as applicable, and shall be situated to maximize readability by the public from public rights-of-way. A sign may be located within the 10-foot setback, if determined necessary by the SEPA Official to provide adequate visibility.

(d) Duration of Installation. Public notification signs shall be installed at the time the DNS, mitigated DNS, or DS is issued. Signage shall remain in place until the final decision on the underlying governmental action. Any required signage installed shall not be removed until the City has taken action on the application and the time for filing an appeal of that action has expired. If an application is denied, any required signage shall remain in place unless the applicant has informed the SEPA Official, in writing, of their intent not to appeal.

(e) Alternative Signage.

(i) Finding of Necessity. Upon a finding of necessity by the SEPA Official, the applicant may employ an alternative to the large sign requirement. Ten signs of a dimension of 11 inches by 17 inches may be posted within 300 feet of the site and at the closest street intersections, subject to the consent of any affected property owner, when one or more of the following conditions exist and the intent of this section is met:

(A) The applicant is not the property owner, and the property owner does not consent to the proposal.

(B) The site is subject to physical characteristics such as steep slopes, wetlands, submerged lands, or thick vegetation, or is located such that the large sign would not be highly visible to neighboring residents and property owners or interested citizens.

(ii) Small Sign Discretion. The SEPA Official is further granted discretion to permit one or more signs of a dimension of 11 inches by 17 inches as an alternative to the large sign requirement when the following conditions exist and the intent of this section is met:

(A) Where, in the opinion of the SEPA Official, the project is of a substantially minor nature; and

(B) In the opinion of the SEPA Official, adequate public notice would be rendered by employment of one or more signs of a dimension of 11 inches by 17 inches as an alternative to the large sign requirement.

[Ord. 1583 § 53, 2013.]


16.10.060 City Council findings.

The City Council finds that:

(1) Development in wetlands results in:

(a) Increased soil erosion and sedimentation of downstream water bodies;

(b) Degraded water quality from increased sedimentation;

(c) Degraded water quality from loss of pollutant removal process of wetlands – sediment trapping, nutrient removal, and chemical detoxification;

(d) Elimination of wildlife and fisheries habitat. Wetland ecosystems support a diverse, unique, and rich group of flora and fauna. Habitat is especially productive at the interface between water and land ecosystems. Several wildlife species specifically require wetland habitats for breeding, nesting, rearing of young, and feeding;

(e) Loss of ground water discharge and recharge areas;

(f) Loss of storm water retention and detention capacity resulting in increased flooding, degraded water quality, and changes in the streamflow regimen of watersheds;

(g) Loss of slow-release detention resulting in loss of recharge to base flow of stream systems during low flow periods and increased peak flows and flooding during storm events; and

(h) Loss of fishery resources from water quality degradation, increased peak flow rates, decreased summer low flows, and changes in the streamflow regimen.

(2) Development in stream corridors results in:

(a) Siltation of streams, which destroys spawning beds, kills fish eggs and alevins, irritates fish gills, reduces aquatic insect populations, fills stream channels, and causes flooding;

(b) Loss of stream corridor vegetation, which raises stream temperatures, destabilizes stream banks, causes erosion, removes nutrients by removing source of fallen leaves and streamside insects, increases sedimentation, and reduces recruitment of large wood debris necessary for stream structure;

(c) Elimination of wildlife and fish habitat. The stream corridor is especially sensitive and is recognized as being among the most productive terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It usually provides all four of the basic habitat components: water, food, cover, and space. The stream corridor is usually richer in habitat diversity and, consequently, wildlife diversity and numbers of individuals are higher than in adjoining upland plant communities. Certain fish and wildlife species are totally dependent on the stream corridor and as uplands are developed, stream corridors become a place of refuge for many wildlife species;

(d) Increased peak flow rates and decreased summer low flow rates of streams, resulting in negative impacts to the physical and chemical requirements critical for sustained fish populations;

(e) Stream channelization, which increases current velocity and bank erosion, removes critical fish rearing and spawning habitat, and reduces habitat diversity and simplifies the biotic community;

(f) Piping of streamflow and crossing of streams by culverts, which increases potential for downstream flooding, reduces migratory fishery range and, therefore, fish populations, removes habitat, and eliminates the biotic community; and

(g) Construction near or within streams, which adversely impacts fish and wildlife by destroying habitat and degrading water quality and increases potential for flooding, property damage, and risk to public health, safety, and welfare.

(3) Development on hillsides results in:

(a) The loss of slope and soil stability as well as increased erosion. The removal of vegetation from hillsides deprives the soil of the stabilizing function of roots, and the moderating effects on wind and water erosion of leaves and branches. Loss of soil stability increases erosion and thus lowers downstream water quality as a result of siltation. Downstream wetlands can be injured in this way. Strong rains on unstable slopes can produce mass movements, such as landslides, slumps, and flaws, particularly in steeply sloping areas;

(b) Increased runoff. Development may alter the natural drainage pattern of a hillside, producing increased runoff and erosion. Removal of vegetative cover decreases percolation of precipitation into the soil, thereby reducing the amount of ground water recharge and adding water to runoff that would ordinarily be transpired by trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roads, parking lots, and buildings, decreases the amount of ground water percolation and thus increases the amount of runoff. Increased runoff, in addition to producing intensified erosion, also creates downstream flood hazards;

(c) Destruction of the community’s aesthetic resources. The hillsides of Des Moines mark the boundaries of several neighborhoods, lend natural character and distinctive features to the City, and provide open space and viewing points of remarkable vistas. They are also often associated with stream corridors and wetlands of the City. Degradation of hillsides resulting from erosion, mass movement, loss of vegetation, and damage to downstream areas deprives Des Moines of its attractive and distinctive setting, and decreases real estate values; and

(d) Major public expenditures to repair facility damages and protect against future damages due to instability created or exacerbated by development. [Ord. 1583 § 54, 2013.]


16.10.070 Special studies required.

When an applicant submits an application for any development proposal, the application shall indicate whether any critical area is located on the site. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall visit the subject property and review the information submitted by the applicant along with any other available information. If the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee determines that sufficient environmental information to evaluate a proposal is not available, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall notify the applicant that special environmental studies are required. Special environmental studies shall include a comprehensive site inventory and analysis, a discussion of potential impacts from the proposed development, and specific measures designed to mitigate any potential adverse environmental impacts of the applicant’s proposal, on- and off-site. All special studies shall be funded by the applicant and conducted under the direct supervision of the Planning, Building and Public Works Department. [Ord. 1583 § 55, 2013.]


16.10.080 Maps and inventories.

(1) The general distribution of critical areas in the City and its planning area is displayed by a series of maps within the conservation element of the Des Moines Comprehensive Plan. These maps shall be used to alert the public and City officials of the potential presence of critical areas on-site or off-site of a development proposal.

(2) Information provided by the maps of critical areas shall be used for general informational and illustrative purposes only. In cases of mapping error and recognizing that critical areas are dynamic environmental processes, the actual presence and location of critical areas, as determined by qualified professional and technical scientists, shall govern the treatment of a proposed development site. [Ord. 1583 § 56, 2013.]


16.10.090 Best management practices required.

All allowed activities under this chapter shall be conducted using the best management practices, adopted pursuant to the King County Surface Water Design Manual which is adopted by this provision and implemented herein as set forth in DMMC 16.10.050, that result in the least amount of impact to the critical areas. Best management practices shall be used for tree, soil, and vegetation protection, construction management, erosion and sedimentation control, water quality protection, and regulation of chemical applications. The City shall observe the use of best management practices to ensure that the activity does not result in degradation to the critical area. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense. [Ord. 1671 § 12, 2017: Ord. 1583 § 57, 2013.]


16.10.100 Development restrictions.

(1) Undevelopable Environmentally Critical Areas. The following environmentally critical areas shall remain undeveloped except as otherwise provided in DMMC 16.10.120 through 16.10.140, 16.10.170 through 16.10.190, and 16.10.230 and 16.10.300:

(a) Wetlands and Their Buffers. The edge of the wetland and the outside edge of its buffer shall be determined and field marked by a professional wetland biologist or similarly qualified professional in accordance with the federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements;

(b) Streams and Their Buffers. The top of the upper bank of the streams and the outside edge of its buffer shall be determined and field marked by a professional biologist, ecologist, or similarly qualified professional; and

(c) Ravine Sidewalls and Bluffs and Their Buffers. The top, toe, and edges of ravine sidewalls and bluffs, and the outside edge of their buffers, shall be determined and field marked by a qualified geotechnical engineer or similarly qualified professional.

(2) Developable Critical Areas. Critical aquifer recharge areas, areas of special flood hazard, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, and hillsides other than ravine sidewalls and bluffs are developable pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The applicant shall clearly and convincingly demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee that the proposal incorporates measures protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. [Ord. 1649 § 3, 2016; Ord. 1583 § 58, 2013.]


16.10.110 Development standards – Compliance – Requirements.

If a proposed project is within, adjacent to, or is likely to impact a critical area, all activities on the site shall be in compliance with the requirements and restrictions set forth in DMMC 16.10.120 through 16.10.280. [Ord. 1583 § 59, 2013.]


16.10.120 Wetlands – Development standards.

If a wetland is located on or contiguous to the site of a development proposal, all activities on the site shall be in compliance with the following requirements and restrictions:

(1) General Performance Requirements.

(a) Activities may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions and functional performance of the wetland.

(b) Activities and uses shall be prohibited in wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this chapter.

(c) Category I Wetlands. Activities and uses shall be prohibited from Category I, except as provided for in the public agency and utility exception, reasonable use exception, and variance sections of this chapter.

(d) Category II and III Wetlands. With respect to activities proposed in Category II and III wetlands, the following standards shall apply:

(i) Where wetland fill is proposed, activities and uses shall be prohibited unless the applicant can demonstrate that:

(A) The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished on another site or sites in the general region while still successfully avoiding or resulting in less adverse impact on a wetland; and

(B) All on-site alternative designs that would avoid or result in less adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer, such as a reduction in the size, scope, configuration or density of the project, are not feasible. Compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of wetland and buffers shall be provided under the terms established under DMMC 16.10.150.

(e) Category IV Wetlands. Activities and uses that result in unavoidable and necessary impacts may be permitted in Category IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved special environmental study and mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives. Compensation for the acreage and loss functions will be provided under the terms established under DMMC 16.10.150.

(2) Wetland Buffers. The following standard buffers shall be established from the wetland edge as delineated and marked in the field:

	 	Width of Buffer (feet)

	Category I Wetlands

	High habitat function (habitat score 8 – 9)	300

	Moderate habitat function (habitat score 5 – 7)	150

	High water quality function and low habitat function or none of the above characteristics (habitat score less than 5)	100

	Category II Wetlands

	High habitat function (habitat score 8 – 9 points)	300

	Moderate habitat function (habitat score 5 – 7)	150

	High water quality function and low habitat function or none of the above characteristics (habitat score less than 5)	100

	Category III Wetlands

	Moderate habitat function (habitat score 5 – 7)	150

	Low habitat or not meeting above criteria (habitat score less than 5)	80

	Category IV Wetlands

	Low functions	50

(a) Where a legally established and constructed street transects a wetland buffer, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may approve a modification of the standard buffer width to the edge of the right-of-way if the isolated part of the buffer does not provide additional protection of the wetland and provides insignificant biological, geological or hydrological buffer functions relating to the wetland. If the resulting buffer distance is less than 50 percent of the standard buffer for the applicable wetland category, no further reduction shall be allowed through wetland buffer reduction or averaging.

(b) Where a buffer has been previously established through City or county development review, and is permanently recorded on title or placed within a separate tract, the buffer shall be as previously established.

(3) Building Setback Lines. A building setback line of 10 feet is required from the edge of any wetland buffer. Minor structural intrusions into the area of the building setback line may be allowed if the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee determines that such intrusions will not negatively impact the critical area.

(4) Increased Wetland Buffers. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may require either additional native vegetation to achieve purposes of this chapter or increased buffer sizes when environmental information indicates the necessity for greater buffers to protect critical area functions, values, or hazards based on site-specific conditions. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing that additional buffer width is reasonably related to protection of critical area functions and values, or protection of public health, safety and welfare. Such determination shall be attached as permit conditions. The determination shall demonstrate that at least one of the following criteria are met:

(a) There is habitat for species listed as threatened or endangered by state or federal agencies present within the environmentally critical area and/or its buffer, and additional buffer is necessary to maintain a viable functional habitat; or

(b) There are conditions or features adjacent to the buffer, such as steep slopes or erosion hazard areas, which over time may pose an additional threat to the viability of the buffer or buffers, if any, associated with the conditions or feature posing the threat in addition to, or to a maximum, beyond the buffer required for the subject critical area.

(c) In cases where additional buffers are not feasible, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may require the applicant to undertake alternative on-site or off-site mitigation measures, including but not limited to a financial contribution to projects or programs which seek to improve environmental quality within the same watershed.

(5) Wetland Buffer Averaging. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may allow modification of the standard wetland buffer width in accordance with an approved special environmental study and the best available science on a case-by-case basis by averaging buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified professional wetland scientist demonstrates that:

(a) It will not reduce wetland functions or functional performance;

(b) The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;

(c) The total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and

(d) The buffer width is not reduced to less than 75 percent of the standard width.

(6) Wetland Buffer Reduction. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may allow reduction of the required wetland buffer widths when accompanied by a special study that identifies appropriate mitigation strategies. Reduction of wetland buffer widths may be allowed where a qualified professional wetland scientist demonstrates that:

(a) The reduction in buffer width is based on reducing the intensity of impacts from proposed land uses. Buffer widths required for proposed land uses with high-intensity impacts to wetlands may be reduced to those recommended for moderate-intensity impacts under the following conditions:

(i) For wetlands that score moderate or high for habitat (five points or more for the habitat functions), the width of the buffer can be reduced if both of the following criteria are met:

(A) A relatively undisturbed, vegetated corridor at least 100 feet wide is protected between the wetland and any other priority habitats as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. The corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat by some type of legal protection such as a conservation easement.

(B) Measures to minimize the impacts of different land uses on wetlands, such as the examples summarized in Table 8C-8 from “Wetlands in Washington State: Volume 2 – Protecting and Managing Wetlands” (Ecology, 2005), are applied.

(ii) For wetlands that score less than five points for habitat, the buffer width can be reduced to that required for moderate land-use impacts by applying measures to minimize the impacts of the proposed land uses. Measures include but are not limited to the following: direct light and noise away from wetlands, route untreated runoff away from wetlands, apply an integrated pest management program, use privacy fencing or vegetative buffer to delineate the wetland buffer edge and discourage disturbance, and use best management practices to control dust (see examples in Table 8C-8).

(b) Reductions in buffer widths where existing roads or structures lie within the buffer. Where a legally established, nonconforming use of the buffer exists (e.g., a road or structure that lies within the width of buffer recommended for that wetland), proposed actions in the buffer may be permitted as long as they do not increase the degree of nonconformity, or if no reasonable alternative exists. This means no increase in the impacts to the wetland from activities in the buffer. [Ord. 1649 § 4, 2016; Ord. 1583 § 60, 2013.]


16.10.130 Wetlands – Reasonable use exceptions.

(1) Adjustments to Dimensional Requirements – Yard Reductions for Building One Single-Family Dwelling. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may allow modification to the required front, rear, or side yard on the opposite of the wetland. The reductions must meet the following standards:

(a) The wetland, wetland buffer and required yard area opposite the wetland equals more than 50 percent of the property dimension of the development site.

(b) A required side yard is reduced to five feet.

(c) A required front or rear yard is reduced to 10 feet.

(2) Single-Family Dwelling. Development of one single-family dwelling within the buffer of a wetland on a development site shall be approved by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee if the applicant demonstrates that:

(a) The extent of development within the buffer is limited to that which is necessary to create a developable area which is no larger than 4,000 square feet;

(b) The proposal utilizes to the maximum extent possible the best available construction, design, and development techniques which result in the least adverse impact on the critical area;

(c) The proposal incorporates the development standards of DMMC 16.10.130 through 16.10.150 and the Surface Water Design Manual adopted pursuant to DMMC 16.10.350 to the maximum extent possible; and

(d) The proposal is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. [Ord. 1583 § 61, 2013.]


16.10.140 Wetlands – Limited exemptions.

The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may allow exemptions from the provisions of this chapter based on the following criteria:

(1) Wetlands larger than 4,000 square feet will be evaluated using standard procedures for wetland review.

(2) Wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet shall be evaluated using the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-29, October 2014, or as revised) to establish category and evaluate functions. The following criteria and local knowledge of natural resources shall be used to determine whether to exempt wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet from the requirement to avoid impacts:

(a) The requirement to avoid impacts may be dropped for Category III and IV wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet that meet all of the following criteria:

(i) Wetland is not associated with a riparian corridor; and

(ii) Wetland is not part of a wetland mosaic; and

(iii) Wetland does not score five points or more for habitat in the wetland rating system; and

(iv) Wetland does not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

(b) Impacts allowed under this provision to these wetlands will be fully mitigated as set forth in DMMC 16.10.150.

(c) All Category I and II wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet should be evaluated with full mitigation sequencing and buffer establishment. Any approved impacts should be adequately compensated by mitigation as set forth in DMMC 16.10.150.

(3) Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet shall be exempt from regulation where the applicant has shown that they:

(a) Are not associated with a riparian corridor;

(b) Are not part of a wetland mosaic; and

(c) Do not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. [Ord. 1649 § 5, 2016: Ord. 1583 § 62, 2013.]


16.10.150 Wetlands – Mitigation requirements.

(1) Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with the Guidance on Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Guidelines for Developing Wetland Mitigation Plans and Proposals, April 2004 (Washington State Department of Ecology, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Seattle District, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10; Ecology Publication No. 04-06-013b), or as revised.

(2) Mitigation shall be required in the following order of preference:

(a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

(b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps such as project redesign, relocation, or timing, to avoid or reduce impacts.

(c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment.

(d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations.

(e) Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments.

(f) Monitoring the required compensation and taking remedial or corrective measures when necessary.

(3) Compensating for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensatory mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when either:

(a) The lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific function assessment, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

(b) Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the City, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

(4) Preference of Mitigation Actions. Methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions shall be approached in the following order of preference:

(a) Restoration (re-establishment and rehabilitation) of wetlands.

(b) Creation (establishment) of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species. This should only be attempted when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is anticipated in the design.

(c) Enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation. Such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

(5) Type and Location of Compensatory Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in-kind and on-site, or in-kind and within the same stream reach, sub-basin, or drift cell (if estuarine wetlands are impacted). Compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply:

(a) There are no reasonable on-site or in sub-drainage basin opportunities (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or on-site and in sub-drainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Considerations should include: anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation, buffer conditions and proposed widths, available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity);

(b) Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland; and

(c) Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin unless:

(i) Established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the City and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or

(ii) Credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the bank’s certification;

(d) The design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location (i.e., position in the landscape). Therefore, compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation, restoration, or enhancement of an atypical wetland. An atypical wetland refers to a compensation wetland (e.g., created or enhanced) that does not match the type of existing wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the site (i.e., the water source(s) and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting). Likewise, it should not provide exaggerated morphology or require a berm or other engineered structures to hold back water. For example, excavating a permanently inundated pond in an existing seasonally saturated or inundated wetland is one example of an enhancement project that could result in an atypical wetland. Another example would be excavating depressions in an existing wetland on a slope, which required the construction of berms to hold the water.

(6) Timing of Compensatory Mitigation. It is preferred that compensatory mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will disturb the on-site wetlands. At the least, compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (e.g., project delay lapses past a fisheries window; or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the compensatory mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the City.

(7) Mitigation Ratios. The following ratios shall apply to creation or restoration that is in-kind, is on-site, is the same category, is timed prior to or concurrent with alteration, and has a high probability of success. The first number specifies the acreage of replacement wetlands and the second specifies the acreage of wetlands altered.

Wetland Mitigation Ratios  

	 	Enhancement	Rehabilitation	Creation

	Category I	16:1	8:1	4:1

	Category II	12:1	6:1	3:1

	Category III	8:1	4:1	2:1

	Category IV	6:1	3:1	1.5:1

(a) The mitigation ratio is the acreage required for compensatory mitigation divided by the acreage of impact.

(b) The ratios are for a concurrent compensatory mitigation project. If the impacts to a wetland are to be mitigated by using an approved and established mitigation bank, the rules and ratios applicable to the bank should be used.

(c) The ratios are based on the assumption that the category, based on wetland ratings established in DMMC 16.01.050 (definition of wetland), and hydrogeomorphic (HGM) class/subclass of the wetland proposed as compensation are the same as the category and HGM class/subclass of the wetland impacts.

(d) Ratios for projects in which the category and HGM class/subclass of wetlands proposed as compensation are not the same as that of the wetland impacts will be determined on a case-by-case basis using the recommended ratios as a starting point. The ratios could be higher in such cases.

(e) Creation can be used in combination with rehabilitation or enhancement. For example, two acres of impact to a Category II wetland would require two acres of creation (i.e., replacing the lost acreage at a 1:1 ratio) and eight acres of rehabilitation or 16 acres of enhancement.

(f) Generally the use of enhancement alone as compensation is discouraged. Using enhancement in combination with some amount of creation is preferred.

(8) Preservation. Impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by preservation of wetland areas when used in combination with other forms of mitigation such as creation, restoration, or enhancement. Preservation may also be used by itself, but more restrictions apply as outlined below.

(a) Acceptable Uses of Preservation. The preservation of at-risk, high quality wetlands and habitat may be considered as part of an acceptable mitigation plan when the following criteria are met:

(i) Preservation is used as a form of compensation only after the standard sequencing of mitigation (avoid, minimize, and then compensate). See subsection (2) of this section;

(ii) Restoration (re-establishment and rehabilitation), creation, and enhancement opportunities have also been considered, and preservation is proposed by the applicant and approved by the permitting agencies as the best compensation option;

(iii) The preservation site is determined to be under imminent threat; that is, the site has the potential to experience a high rate of undesirable ecological change due to on-site or off-site activities that are not regulated (e.g., logging of forested wetlands). This potential includes permitted, planned, or likely actions;

(iv) The area proposed for preservation is of high quality or critical for the health of the watershed or basin due to its location. Some of the following features may be indicative of high quality sites:

(A) Category I or II wetland rating;

(B) Rare or irreplaceable wetland type (e.g., bogs, mature forested wetlands, estuaries) or aquatic habitat that is rare or a limited resource in the area;

(C) Habitat for threatened or endangered species;

(D) Provides biological and/or hydrological connectivity;

(E) High regional or watershed importance (e.g., listed as priority site in a watershed or basin plan);

(F) Large size with high species diversity (plants and/or animals) and/or high abundance of native species;

(G) A site that is continuous with the head of a watershed, or with a lake or pond in an upper watershed that significantly improves outflow hydrology and water quality.

(b) Preservation in Combination with Other Forms of Compensation. Using preservation as compensation is acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation and the criteria below are met:

(i) All criteria listed in subsection (8)(a) of this section are met;

(ii) The impact area is small and/or impacts are occurring to a low functioning system (Category III or IV wetland);

(iii) Preservation of a high-quality system occurs in the same watershed or basin as the wetland impact;

(iv) Preservation sites include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation; and

(v) Mitigation ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation shall range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being impacted and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.

(c) Preservation as the Sole Means of Compensation for Wetland Impacts. Preservation alone shall only be used as compensatory mitigation in exceptional circumstances. Preservation alone shall not apply if impacts are occurring to functions that must be replaced on-site, such as flood storage or water quality treatment that need to be replicated by water quality measures implemented within the project limits. Preservation of at-risk, high-quality wetlands and habitat (as defined above) may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met:

(i) All criteria listed in subsections (8)(a) and (8)(b) of this section are met;

(ii) There are no adverse impacts to habitat for fish and species listed as endangered and threatened;

(iii) There is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin;

(iv) Higher mitigation ratios are applied. Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20:1. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost.

(9) Wetland Mitigation Banks.

(a) Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:

(i) The bank is certified under chapter 173-700 WAC;

(ii) The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

(iii) The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.

(b) Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

(c) Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, the service area of the bank may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions.

(10) Substitute Fees. In cases where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee that a suitable compensation site does not exist, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may allow the applicant to make a financial contribution to a water quality project or program performing critical areas enhancement, restoration, or mitigation. The project or program must improve environmental quality within the same watershed as the altered wetland. The amount of the fee shall be determined by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee and shall be equal to the cost of mitigating the impact of the wetland alteration.

(11) Mitigation Plan Requirements. When mitigation is required, the applicant shall submit for approval a mitigation plan prepared by a qualified scientist(s) following procedures set forth in the state Department of Ecology Guidelines for Developing Freshwater Wetlands Mitigation Plans and Proposals, 2004, or as revised.

(12) Final Approval. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall grant final approval of a completed compensation project if the final report of the project mitigation plan satisfactorily documents that the area has achieved all requirements of this section and DMMC 16.10.310. [Ord. 1649 § 6, 2016; Ord. 1583 § 63, 2013.]


16.10.160 Streams – Development standards.

If a stream is located on or contiguous to the site of a development proposal, all activities on the site shall be in compliance with the following requirements and restrictions:

(1) Stream Buffers. The following standard buffers shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark or from the top of the bank if the ordinary high water mark cannot be identified:

	Water Type	Buffer Width (feet)

	Types S or F	115

	Types Np or Ns	65

Type S: streams inventoried as “shorelines of the state” under the City’s Shoreline Master Program.

Type F: streams that are salmonid-bearing or have the potential to support salmonids.

Type Np: streams that are perennial during a year of normal rainfall and do not have the potential to support salmonids use.

Type Ns: streams that are seasonal or ephemeral during a year of normal rainfall and do not have the potential to support salmonids use.

(a) Where a legally established and constructed street transects a stream buffer, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may approve a modification of the standard buffer width to the edge of the street if the isolated part of the buffer does not provide additional protection of the stream and provides insignificant biological, geological or hydrological buffer functions relating to the stream. If the resulting buffer distance is less than 50 percent of the standard buffer, no further reduction shall be allowed.

(b) Where a buffer has been previously established through City or county development review, and is permanently recorded on title or placed within a separate tract, the buffer shall be as previously established, provided it is at least 50 percent of the required standard buffer distance.

(c) Any stream relocated or altered as part of approved mitigation measures shall have at least the minimum buffer required for the type of stream involved.

(d) If the stream buffer includes a steep slope hazard area or landslide hazard area, the stream buffer width is the greater of either the stream buffer in this section or 25 feet beyond the top of the hazard area.

(e) Any stream adjoined by a riparian wetland or other contiguous critical area shall have the buffer required for the stream type involved or the buffer that applies to the wetland or other critical area, whichever is greater.

(2) Increased Stream Buffer. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall require increased buffer widths in accordance with the recommendations of a qualified biologist and the best available science on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect stream functions and values based on site-specific characteristics.

This determination shall be based on one or more of the following criteria:

(a) A larger buffer is needed to protect other critical areas;

(b) The buffer or adjacent upland has a slope greater than 30 percent or is susceptible to erosion and standard erosion-control measures will not prevent adverse impacts to the wetland.

(c) In cases where additional buffers are not feasible, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may require the applicant to undertake alternative on-site or off-site mitigation measures, including but not limited to a financial contribution to projects or programs which seek to improve environmental quality within the same watershed.

(3) Pursuant to RCW 35.21.180, the King County, Washington “Surface Water Design Manual,” including all subsequent revisions, is adopted by reference as the “Surface Water Design Manual for the City of Des Moines” in DMMC 16.10.350.

(4) Building Setback Lines. A building setback line of 10 feet is required from the edge of any stream buffer. Minor structural intrusions into the area of the building setback line may be allowed if the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee determines that such intrusions will not negatively impact the critical area. [Ord. 1583 § 64, 2013.]


16.10.170 Streams – Reasonable use exceptions.

(1) Adjustments to Dimensional Requirements.

(a) Yard Reductions for Building One Single-Family Dwelling. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may allow modification to the required front, rear, or side yard on the opposite of the stream. The reductions must meet the following standards:

(i) The stream, stream buffer and required yard area opposite the stream equals more than 50 percent of the property dimension of the development site.

(ii) A required side yard is reduced to five feet.

(iii) A required front or rear yard is reduced to 10 feet.

(2) Single-Family Dwelling. Development of one single-family dwelling within the buffer of a stream on a development site shall be approved by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee if the applicant demonstrates that:

(a) The extent of development within the buffer is limited to that which is necessary to create a developable area which is no larger than 4,000 square feet;

(b) The proposal utilizes to the maximum extent possible the best available construction, design, and development techniques which result in the least adverse impact on the environmentally critical area;

(c) The proposal incorporates the development standards of DMMC 16.10.160 and the Surface Water Design Manual to the maximum extent possible; and

(d) The proposal is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. [Ord. 1583 § 65, 2013.]


16.10.180 Streams – Limited exemptions.

The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may allow exemptions from the provisions of this chapter based on the following provisions:

(1) Stream Crossings. Stream crossings, whether for access or utility purposes, shall be avoided to the extent possible. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may approve stream crossings only when he/she determines that there are no practicable or reasonable alternatives, and when the proposal complies with all of the following criteria:

(a) Bridges are required for streams which support salmonids; and

(b) All crossings using culverts shall use superspan or oversize culverts; and

(c) All construction and installation crossings shall comply with timing restrictions set by federal and state permit processes, generally during summer low flow; and

(ii) A three-year to five-year monitoring program to measure success of the restoration;

(iii) Mitigation shall be designed to accommodate a 100-year storm event.

(3) Stream Channel, Stream Bank, Bluff, or Shore Stabilization. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may approve stabilization of stream channels, stream banks, bluffs, or shorelines when he/she determines that the proposed stabilization complies with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Integrated Streambank Protection Guidelines (2003) and the following criteria as applicable:

(a) Naturally occurring movement threatens existing structures, public improvements, unique natural resources, or the only feasible access to property.

(b) In the case of streams, stabilization results in improved fish and wildlife habitat, flood control, and improved water quality.

(c) The preferred methodology for stream channel and bank stabilization is bioengineering or some combination of bioengineering and more traditional structural solutions. Bioengineering involves use of plant materials to stabilize eroding stream channels and banks.

(d) The preferred methodology for bluff and shore stabilization is naturalistic shoreline protection measures such as creation of beaches that absorb and dissipate wave energy. Bluff and shore stabilization shall follow the standards of the Shoreline Master Program for the construction of any stabilization device.

(e) Relocation and dredging shall follow all applicable local, state, and federal laws and receive approvals from the agencies administering such laws. [Ord. 1583 § 66, 2013.]


16.10.190 Streams – Mitigation requirements.

(1) Compensatory mitigation for alterations to streams shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions.

(a) On-Site and In-Kind for Streams. For streams, the applicant shall maintain or improve stream channel dimensions, including depth, length, and gradient; restore or improve native vegetation and fish and wildlife habitat; and create an equivalent or improved channel bed, biofiltration, and meandering. Unless otherwise specified by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee, such mitigation to replace and enhance stream elements such as pools, riffles, and spawning gravel shall be provided on a relative 2:1 basis.

(b) Off-Site and In-Kind for Streams. When environmental information demonstrates that greater functions and values will be achieved, off-site compensation of greater size, functions, and values may be approved if the compensation project is within the same subwatershed as the wetland or stream to be altered. Unless otherwise specified by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee, such mitigation shall be provided pursuant to the ratios specified in this section.

(c) Conditions Preceding Stream Alteration. In the case of the exceptions of DMMC 16.10.160, the following conditions shall precede any stream alteration approved pursuant to this section:

16.10.210 Ravine sidewalls and bluffs – Development standards.

Activities on ravine sidewalls and bluffs shall meet the general performance requirements of DMMC 16.10.200 and the specific following requirements:

(1) Buffers. A 50-foot undisturbed buffer of native vegetation shall be established from the top, toe, and sides of all ravine sidewalls and bluffs.

(2) Buffer Reduction. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may approve a reduction in the width of the required buffer, to a minimum width of 10 feet, when special environmental studies are provided that demonstrate all of the following:

(a) A licensed engineer specializing in geotechnical analysis or a licensed engineering geologist, after review of the geologic conditions of the site, the proposed development plans, and all mitigation measures proposed or required, concludes in a written statement that the development proposal will result in minimal risk of soil instability; and

(b) Special mitigation measures regarding design, construction, and maintenance can reasonably be employed to minimize adverse environmental impacts associated with the proposal; and

(c) The proposal represents minimal disruption of existing native vegetation.

(3) Additional Buffers. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may require increased buffers if environmental studies indicate such increases are necessary to mitigate landslide, seismic and erosion hazards, or as otherwise necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

(4) Building Setback Lines. A building setback line of 10 feet is required from the edge of any buffer of a ravine sidewall or bluff. Minor structural intrusions into the area of the building setback line may be allowed if the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee determines that such intrusions will not negatively impact the critical area.

(5) All buffers shall be measured from the top, toe, and sides of all ravine sidewalls or bluffs. [Ord. 1583 § 69, 2013.]


16.10.220 Hillsides of 15 percent slope and greater – Development standards – Disturbance limitations.

Development on hillsides shall comply with the general performance requirements of DMMC 16.10.200 and the following requirements regarding disturbance limitations, development location, development design, construction techniques, and landscaping.

(1) Amount of Disturbance Allowed. The following chart sets forth the maximum slope disturbance allowed on a development site:

	Slope	Amount of Slope Which Can Be Disturbed	Factor

	0 – 15%	100%	1.00

	15 – 25%	60%	0.60

	25 – 40%	45%	0.45

	40%+	30%	0.30

The overall amount of disturbance allowed on development sites which have any combination of the above slope categories shall be determined by the following formula:

 

	(Square Footage of Site having 0–15% slopes) X 1.00 + (Square Footage of Site having 15–25% slopes) X 0.60 + (Square Footage of Site having 25–40% slopes) X 0.45 + (Square Footage of Site having 40%+ slopes) X 0.30 = Total Amount of Allowable Site Disturbance.

(2) Development Location.

(a) Structures and improvements shall be clustered to retain as much open space as possible and the natural topographic character of the slope; and

(b) Structures and improvements shall conform to the natural contour of the slope, foundations must be tiered to generally conform to the existing topography of the site; and

(c) Structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most sensitive portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation.

(3) Development Design.

(a) The footprint of buildings and other disturbed areas shall be minimized. The least number of buildings is desirable in order to consolidate the development; and

(b) Standard prepared building pads (slab on grade) resulting in grading more than 10 feet outside the building footprint area are prohibited; and

(c) Use of common access drives and utility corridors is required where feasible; and

(d) Impervious lot coverage shall be minimized. With the exception of detached single-family structures, understructure parking and multilevel structures shall be incorporated where feasible; and

(e) Roads, walkways, and parking areas shall be designed to parallel the natural contours of the steep slope hazard areas while maintaining consolidated areas of natural topography and vegetation. Access shall be located in the least environmentally critical area feasible; and

(f) Use of retaining walls which allow the maintenance of existing natural slope areas is preferred over graded artificial slopes.

(4) Construction Techniques.

(a) Use of foundation walls as retaining walls is preferable to rock or concrete walls built separately and away from the building. Freestanding retaining devices are only permitted when they cannot be designed as structural elements of the building foundation; and

(b) Use of pole-type construction which conforms to the existing topography is desirable where feasible; and

(c) Structures shall be tiered to conform to existing topography and to minimize topographic modification. Piled deck support structures are preferred for parking or garages over fill-based construction types.

(5) Landscaping. The disturbed area of a development site not used for buildings and other improvements shall be landscaped according to a landscape design which will achieve a minimum 40 percent coverage by the canopy of trees and shrubs within 10 years to provide habitat desirable to native western Washington birds. The trees and shrubs shall be a mix of shade, flowering, and coniferous and broad-leaf evergreens that are either native to the Puget Sound region or are valuable to western Washington birds. The Department of Wildlife “Plants for Wildlife in Western Washington” shall be used as a general guide.

(a) Trees shall be the following size at time of planting and shall conform to the “American Standard for Nursery Stock”:

(i) Single-stem shade and flowering trees shall be a minimum one-inch caliper trunk as measured six inches above the ground.

(ii) Multistem shade and flowering trees shall be a minimum height of eight feet as measured from the ground level to the average uppermost point of growth of the plant.

(iii) Coniferous evergreen trees (Types 4, 5, and 6) shall be a minimum height of six feet as measured from the ground to the midpoint between the uppermost whorl and the tip of the leader. For species of trees without whorls, minimum height shall be measured to the uppermost side growth. The ratio of height to spread shall not be less than 5:3.

(iv) Broad-leaf evergreen trees (Types 4 and 5) shall be a minimum height of four feet as measured from the ground level to where the main part of the plant ends, not to the tip of a thin shoot.

(b) Shrubs shall be of the following size at time of planting and shall conform to the “American Standard for Nursery Stock”:

(i) Dwarf and semi-dwarf deciduous shrubs shall be a minimum height of two to two and one-half feet above grade, and either a No. 3 container size for container-grown plants, 10-inch diameter root ball for balled and burlapped plants, or 11-inch root spread for bare-root plants.

(ii) Strong-growing deciduous shrubs shall be a minimum height of two to three feet above grade, and either a No. 3 container size for container-grown plants, 10-inch diameter root ball for balled and burlapped plants, or 11-inch root spread for bare-root plants.

16.10.230 Ravine sidewalls, bluffs, and hillsides of 15 percent slope and greater – Reasonable use exceptions.

(1) Limited Waiver of Hillside Disturbance Limitations. Any one or all of the disturbance limitation requirements of DMMC 16.10.220 may be waived if the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee determines that the application of such requirements is not feasible for developing one single-family dwelling on a development site and the proposal is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. [Ord. 1583 § 71, 2013.]


16.10.240 Seismic hazard areas – Development standards.

Development in seismic hazard areas shall be in accordance with the standards for earthquake design and seismic motion as established in the Des Moines Buildings and Construction Code (Title 14 DMMC). Seismic hazard areas shall be altered only when the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee concludes, based on environmental information, the following:

(1) There is no actual hazard based on a lack of seismic activity in the past in the area of the development proposal, and a quantitative analysis of potential for seismic activity indicates no significant risk to the development proposal; or

(2) The development proposal can be designed so that it will be as safe from any earthquake damage as a similar development not located in a seismic hazard area. [Ord. 1583 § 72, 2013.]


16.10.250 Erosion and landslide hazard areas – Development standards.

Development on hillsides containing or adjacent to erosion or landslide hazard areas shall meet the general performance requirements of DMMC 16.10.200 and the following:

(1) Buffer Requirement. A buffer shall be established from all edges of landslide hazard areas. The size of the buffer shall be determined by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee to eliminate or minimize the risk of property damage, death, or injury resulting from landslides caused in whole or part by the development, based upon review of and concurrence with a special environmental study prepared by a qualified professional.

(a) Minimum Buffer. The minimum buffer shall be equal to the height of the slope or 50 feet, whichever is greater;

(b) Increased Buffer. The buffer may be increased where the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed and existing development;

(c) Buffer Reduction. The buffer may be reduced to a minimum of 10 feet when a qualified professional demonstrates to the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee’s satisfaction that the reduction will adequately protect the proposed development, adjacent developments, and uses and the subject critical area;

(2) Alterations. Alterations of an erosion or landslide hazard area and/or buffer may only occur for activities for which a hazards analysis is submitted and certifies that:

(a) The development will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond pre-development conditions;

(b) The development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent properties; and

(c) Such alterations will not adversely impact other critical areas;

(3) Design Standards.

(b) Structures and improvements shall be clustered to avoid geologically hazardous areas and other critical areas;

(c) Structures and improvements shall minimize alterations to the natural contour of the slope, and foundations shall be tiered where possible to conform to existing topography;

(d) Structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation;

(e) The proposed development shall not result in greater risk or a need for increased buffers on neighboring properties;

(f) The use of retaining walls that allow the maintenance of existing natural slope area is preferred over graded artificial slopes; and

(g) Development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage;

(4) Vegetation Retention. Unless otherwise provided or as part of an approved alteration, removal of vegetation from an erosion or landslide hazard area or related buffer shall be prohibited;

(5) Seasonal Restriction. Land clearing, grading, or filling shall be limited to the period between April 1st and October 1st; provided, that the City may extend or shorten the dry season on a case-by-case basis depending on actual weather conditions;

Storm water conveyance shall be allowed only through a high-density polyethylene pipe with fuse-welded joints, or similar product that is technically equal or superior;

(7) Point Discharges. Point discharges from surface water facilities and roof drains onto or upstream from an erosion or landslide hazard area shall be prohibited except as follows:

(a) Conveyed via continuous storm pipe downslope to a point where there are no erosion hazard areas downstream from the discharge;

(b) Discharged at flow durations matching predeveloped conditions, with adequate energy dissipation, into existing channels that previously conveyed storm water runoff in the predeveloped state; or

(c) Dispersed discharge upslope of the steep slope onto a low-gradient undisturbed buffer demonstrated to be adequate to infiltrate all surface and storm water runoff, and where it can be demonstrated that such discharge will not increase the saturation of the slope;

(8) Subdivisions. The division of land in landslide hazard areas and associated buffers is subject to the following:

(a) Land that is located wholly within a landslide hazard area or its buffer may not be subdivided. Land that is located partially within a landslide hazard area or its buffer may be divided; provided, that each resulting lot has sufficient buildable area outside of, and will not affect, the landslide hazard area or its buffer;

16.10.290 Limited density transfer.

(1) Density and Floor Area Calculation. The calculation of potential dwelling units in residential development proposals and allowable floor area in commercial development proposals shall be determined by the ratio of developable area to undevelopable critical area of the development site. The following formula for density and floor area calculations is designed to provide compensation for the preservation of critical areas, flexibility in design, and consistent treatment of different types of development proposals. The formula shall apply to all residential zones (including PUD) and all commercial zones.

(2) Formulas. The maximum number of dwelling units (DU) for a site which contains undevelopable critical areas is equal to:

 

	[(Developable Area) divided by (Minimum Lot Area/DU)] + [(Undevelopable Area) divided by (Minimum Lot Area/DU) (Development Factor)] = Maximum Number of Dwelling Units.

The maximum amount of commercial floor area for a site which contains undevelopable critical areas is equal to:

	[(Maximum Permitted Floor Area/Lot Area) (Developable Area)] + [(Maximum Permitted Floor Area/Lot Area) (Undevelopable Area) (Development Factor)] = Maximum Amount of Floor Area.

Developable critical areas shall receive full credit towards calculating the number of dwelling units or floor area.

(3) Development Factor. The development factor is a number to be used in calculating the number of dwelling units or the maximum allowable floor area for a site which contains undevelopable critical areas. The development factor is derived from the following table:

	Undevelopable Environmentally Critical Area as Percentage of Site (Percent)	Development Factor

	1 – 10	0.30

	11 – 20	0.27

	21 – 30	0.24

	31 – 40	0.21

	41 – 50	0.18

	51 – 60	0.15

	61 – 70	0.12

	71 – 80	0.09

16.15.010 Title.

This chapter shall be entitled “Flood Hazard Areas Code.” [Ord. 1583 § 89, 2013.]


16.15.020 Application.

This chapter applies to all development on all properties within areas of flood hazard, as further defined by this chapter. [Ord. 1583 § 90, 2013.]


16.15.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the provisions of chapter 86.16 RCW in coordinating the flood plain management regulation aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program. [Ord. 1583 § 91, 2013.]


16.15.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to chapter 18.86 RCW, chapter 173-158 WAC and WAC 173-220-030. [Ord. 1583 § 92, 2013.]


16.15.050 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for King County, Washington and Incorporated Areas” dated August 19, 2020, and any revisions thereto, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Title. The FIS and the FIRM are on file at 21630 11th Ave. S., Suite D, Des Moines, WA 98198. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in DMMC 16.15.110 shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under DMMC 16.15.110. [Ord. 1738 § 2, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 93, 2013.]


16.15.060 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. [Ord. 1738 § 3, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 94, 2013.]


16.15.070 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

(1) Considered as minimum requirements; and

(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted to the City under state statutes. [Ord. 1583 § 95, 2013.]


16.15.080 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create any legal liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any lawfully made administrative decision. [Ord. 1583 § 96, 2013.]


16.15.090 Establishment of development permit.

A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of flood hazard established in DMMC 16.15.050. The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes and for all other development including fill and other activities. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and shall include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, on-site storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information shall be furnished by the applicant:

(1) Elevation, in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; and

(2) Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed; and

(3) Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in DMMC 16.15.180(2); and

(4) Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and

(5) Where a structure is proposed in a V, V1-30, or VE Zone, a V-Zone design certificate is required; and

(6) Where development is proposed in a floodway, an engineering analysis indicating no rise of the base flood elevation; and

(7) A report which identifies and assesses habitat impacts, if any, and proposes conservation methods consistent with federal permitting requirements. Preparation of the report shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall utilize the expertise of a biologist specializing in wetland, riverine, or coastal zone ecology; and

(8) Any other such information that may be reasonably required by the Floodplain Administrator in order to review the application. [Ord. 1738 § 4, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 97, 2013.]


16.15.100 Designation and duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.

The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement this Title by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions.

Duties of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

(1) Reviewing all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; and

(2) Reviewing all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required; and

(3) The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and

(4) Notify FEMA when annexations occur in the special flood hazard area; and

(5) Reviewing all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of DMMC 16.15.200(1) are met. [Ord. 1738 § 5, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 98, 2013.]


16.15.110 Use of other base flood data (in A and V Zones).

When base flood elevation data has not been provided (in A or V Zones) in accordance with DMMC 16.15.050, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer DMMC 16.15.180 and 16.15.200. [Ord. 1738 § 6, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 99, 2013.]


16.15.120 Information to be obtained and maintained.

(1) Where base flood elevation data is provided through flood insurance studies, FIRMs, or as in DMMC 16.15.110, obtain and record the actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.

(2) Documentation of the elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member in V or VE Zones.

(3) For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required in DMMC 16.15.110:

(a) Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and

(b) Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in DMMC 16.15.090(3).

(6) Improvement and damage calculations.

(7) Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

(8) In coastal high hazard areas, certification shall be obtained from a registered professional engineer or architect that the structure is securely anchored to adequately anchored pilings or columns in order to withstand high velocity waters, storm surges, and tsunamis. [Ord. 1738 § 7, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 100, 2013.]


16.15.130 Alteration of watercourses.

(1) Notify adjacent communities and the state Department of Ecology (DOE) prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.

(2) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. [Ord. 1583 § 101, 2013.]


16.15.140 Interpretation of FIRM boundaries.

Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in DMMC 16.15.170. Such appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of Appeals and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 C.F.R. 59 through 76). [Ord. 1583 § 102, 2013.]


16.15.145 Changes to special flood hazard area.

(1) If a project will alter the base flood elevation (BFE) or boundaries of the special flood hazard area (SFHA), then the project proponent shall provide the community with engineering documentation and analysis regarding the proposed change. If the change to the BFE or boundaries of the SFHA would normally require a letter of map change, then the project proponent shall initiate, and receive approval of, a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) prior to approval of the development permit. The project shall be constructed in a manner consistent with the approved CLOMR.

(2) If a CLOMR application is made, then the project proponent shall also supply the full CLOMR documentation package to the Floodplain Administrator to be attached to the floodplain development permit, including all required property owner notifications. [Ord. 1738 §§ 14, 18, 2020.]


16.15.150 Appeal and variances.

Appeals of administrative orders, decisions or determinations under this chapter shall be processed pursuant to chapter 18.20 DMMC. [Ord. 1738 § 8, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 103, 2013.]


16.15.160 Variance criteria and conditions.

(1) When considering an application for a variance to any provisions of this chapter, the Hearing Examiner shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; and

(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; and

(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; and

(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; and

(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; and

(f) The availability of alternate locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; and

(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; and

(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; and

(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; and

(j) The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

(2) Conditions for Variances.

(a) Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be granted shall be for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below base flood level; provided, that the variance criteria listed above have been fully considered.

(b) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(c) Variances shall not be granted within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(d) Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(e) Variances shall only be granted upon:

(i) A showing of good and sufficient cause; and

(ii) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(f) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that such variances pertain to a physical piece of property; such variances are not personal in nature and do not pertain to a structure, inhabitants thereof, or economic or financial circumstances.

(g) Variances may be granted for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing where it can be determined that such action has a low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except DMMC 16.15.180(2)(a)(iv), and otherwise complies with the general standards of this chapter.

(h) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. [Ord. 1738 § 9, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 104, 2013.]


16.15.170 Provisions for flood hazard protection – General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:

(1) Anchoring.

(a) All new construction and substantial improvements, including those related to manufactured homes, shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy.

(b) All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques, FEMA 85).

(2) Construction Materials and Methods.

(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

(b) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

(c) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

(3) Utilities.

(a) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.

(b) Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway.

(c) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters.

(d) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to such systems or contamination from such systems during flooding. Locating such equipment below the base flood elevation may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be increased.

(4) Subdivision Proposals.

(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.

(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.

(c) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.

(d) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 10 lots or one acre, whichever is less. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).

(5) Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source, applications for building permits shall be reviewed by the Building Official to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. [Ord. 1738 § 10, 2020; Ord. 1738 § 10, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 105, 2013.]


16.15.180 Specific standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in DMMC 16.15.050 or 16.15.110, the following provisions are required:

(1) Residential Construction.

(a) In AE and A1-30 Zones or other A zoned areas where the BFE has been determined or can be reasonably obtained, new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the BFE. Mechanical equipment and utilities shall be waterproof or elevated at least one foot above the BFE.

(b) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure in an unnumbered A Zone for which a BFE is not available and cannot be reasonably obtained shall be reasonably safe from flooding, but in all cases the lowest floor shall be at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.

(c) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure in a V, V1-30, or VE Zone shall meet the requirements in DMMC 16.15.240.

(d) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(i) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters.

(iv) A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters.

(2) Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall meet the requirements of subsection (a) or (b) below:

(a) New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall meet all of the following requirements:

(i) In AE and A1-30 Zones or other A-zoned areas where the BFE has been determined or can be reasonably obtained:

(A) New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the BFE, or elevated as required by ASCE 24, whichever is greater.

(B) Mechanical equipment and utilities shall be waterproofed or elevated at least one foot above the BFE, or as required by ASCE 24, whichever is greater.

(ii) If located in an Unnumbered A Zone for which a BFE is not available and cannot be reasonably obtained, the structure shall be reasonably safe from flooding, but in all cases the lowest floor shall be at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.

(iii) If located in a V, V1-30, or VE Zone, the structure shall meet the requirements in DMMC 16.15.240.

(iv) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(A) Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.

(B) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

(C) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood water.

(D) A garage attached to a structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters.

(b) If the requirements of subsection (2)(a) of this section are not met, then new construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall meet all of the following requirements:

(i) Be dry-floodproofed so that below one foot or more above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water or dry-floodproofed to the elevation required by ASCE 24, whichever is greater; and

(ii) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

(iii) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator; and

(iv) Nonresidential structures that are elevated but not floodproofed must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (2)(a)(iv) of this section; and

(v) Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below). Floodproofing the building an additional foot will reduce insurance premiums.

(3) Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes in the floodplain to be placed or substantially improved on sites shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This subsection applies to new manufactured homes placed on any site, manufactured homes in a new or expanded manufactured home park or subdivision, and new manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park and subdivision.

(4) Recreational Vehicles (44 CFR 60.3(c)(14)). Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:

(a) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

(5) New Enclosed Area Below the Lowest Floor. If buildings or manufactured homes are constructed or substantially improved with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor, the areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage.

(6) New Appurtenant Structures (Detached Garages and Small Storage Structures). For A Zones (A, AE, A1-30, AH, AO):

(a) Appurtenant structures used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage may be constructed such that the floor is below the BFE, provided the structure is designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements:

(i) Use of the appurtenant structure must be limited to parking of vehicles or limited storage;

(ii) The portions of the appurtenant structure located below the BFE must be built using flood resistant materials;

(iii) The appurtenant structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement;

(iv) Any machinery or equipment servicing the appurtenant structure must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the BFE;

(v) The appurtenant structure must comply with floodway encroachment provisions in DMMC 16.15.200(1);

(vi) The appurtenant structure must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters in accordance with subsection (1)(d) of this section;

(vii) The structure shall have low damage potential;

(viii) If the structure is converted to another use, it must be brought into full compliance with the standards governing such use; and

(ix) The structure shall not be used for human habitation.

(b) Detached garages, storage structures, and other appurtenant structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in subsection (1) of this section.

(c) Upon completion of the structure, certification that the requirements of this section have been satisfied shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator for verification. [Ord. 1738 § 11, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 106, 2013.]


16.15.190 AE and A1-30 Zones with base flood elevations but no floodways.

In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. [Ord. 1583 § 107, 2013.]


16.15.200 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in DMMC 16.15.050 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(2) Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

(a) Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

(b) Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

(i) Before the repair or reconstruction is started; or

(ii) If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or to structures identified as historic places, may be excluded from the 50 percent.

(3) If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of DMMC 16.15.170 through 16.15.200. [Ord. 1738 § 12, 2020; Ord. 1583 § 108, 2013.]


16.15.210 Critical facility.

Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet above BFE or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the BFE shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. [Ord. 1738 §§ 15, 19, 2020.]


16.15.220 Wetlands management.

To the maximum extent possible, each development subject to this chapter shall avoid the short-term and long-term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands, especially those activities which limit or disrupt the ability of the wetland to alleviate flooding impacts. The following process shall be implemented for such development:

(1) Review proposals for development within base floodplains for their possible impacts on wetlands located within the floodplain.

(2) Ensure that development activities in or around wetlands do not negatively affect public safety, health, and welfare by disrupting the ability of the wetland to reduce flood and storm drainage.

(3) Request technical assistance from the Department of Ecology in identifying wetland areas. Existing wetland map information from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) may be used in conjunction with the area’s FIRM to prepare an overlay zone indicating critical wetland areas deserving special attention. [Ord. 1583 § 109, 2013.]


16.15.230 Compliance with federal and state permits required.

No approval of an application for a development permit within an area of special flood hazard shall be issued without first demonstrating compliance with all necessary federal and state environmental permit requirements, including, but not limited to, Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, Section 404 permits and Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531, Section 10 permits. [Ord. 1583 § 110, 2013.]


16.15.240 Standards for coastal high hazard areas (V Zones).

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in DMMC 16.15.050 are coastal high hazard areas, which are designated as Zones V1-V30, VE, and V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:

(1) All new allowable construction and substantial improvement in Zones V1-V30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) on the community’s FIRM shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:

(a) For residential buildings, the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level; and

(b) For nonresidential buildings, the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level or meets the elevation requirements of ASCE 24, whichever is higher; and

(c) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval); and

(d) A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (1)(a) and (b) of this section.

(2) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in Zones V1-V30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all such information.

(4) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood latticework, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:

(a) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

(b) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

(5) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.

(6) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM.

(7) Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM which would increase potential flood damage.

(b) Does not increase the number of lots; and

(c) Complies with the provisions of chapter 17.35 DMMC; and

This chapter shall be entitled “Layout and Design of Subdivisions and Similar Requirements.” [Ord. 1585 § 96, 2013.]


17.35.020 Application.

The provisions of this chapter apply to each subdivision, short subdivision, subdivision alteration, subdivision vacation and, to the extent possible, each binding site plan, modified subdivision, and modified short subdivision within the City. For the purposes of this chapter, the term “subdivision” also includes “short subdivision,” “subdivision alteration,” “subdivision vacation,” “binding site plan,” and “modified subdivision.” The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to any subdivisions approved in conjunction with a planned unit development (PUD) pursuant to Title 18 DMMC, unless the provisions are specifically varied by the PUD. [Ord. 1585 § 97, 2013.]


17.35.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to identify layout and design standards for the actions set forth in DMMC 17.35.020. [Ord. 1585 § 98, 2013.]


17.35.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapter 58.17 RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1585 § 99, 2013.]


17.35.050 Lot standards.

(1) General. All lots within a subdivision shall meet the minimum size and dimension requirements of Title 18 DMMC for the zone classification assigned to the property proposed to be subdivided.

(2) Configuration. Lots shall be shaped so that reasonable use and development is possible. Where topography, natural features, and the existing development pattern permit, the depth of lots less than 15,000 square feet in area shall be at least equal to, but not more than, twice the width of the lot.

(3) Orientation. Where topography, natural features, and the existing development pattern permit, side lot lines generally shall be at right angles to the street upon which the lot faces, except that on curved streets they shall be at a right angle to the tangent of the curve.

(4) Frontage. Every lot shall have a minimum of 20 feet of frontage on a street that is fully improved and approved by the City.

(5) Corner Lots. All corner lots shall be five feet wider than the minimum lot width required by the underlying zone.

(6) Odd Lots. Subdivisions having lots with an irregular shape and unable to be classified under Title 18 DMMC shall show setback lines for such lots and provide covenants requiring such setbacks with recording of the final plat. [Ord. 1585 § 100, 2013.]


17.35.060 General layout.

(1) General. The subdivision shall be designed to allow for reasonable subdivision and use of adjoining properties, including, but not limited to, considerations related to surface water management, all utilities, and pedestrian and vehicular access. While the subdivision should generally conform to the City’s grid pattern and street plan, innovative layouts will be considered based on the general requirements of this chapter.

(2) Maximum Length. Where topography, natural features, and the existing development pattern permit, blocks shall not exceed 500 feet in length. Blocks that are more than 750 feet in length should allow for midblock pedestrian ways pursuant to DMMC 17.25.100.

(3) Project Integration. All proposed subdivisions shall be designed to provide pedestrian and vehicular connections to adjoining developed or vacant properties when such connections will result in improved access or planned access and be in the public interest. [Ord. 1585 § 101, 2013.]


17.35.070 Access – General.

(1) All lots shall have direct legal access to either a right-of-way or a private street within a vehicular access tract meeting the requirements of this chapter. Access shall be to a right-of-way unless extension of a right-of-way to a lot is constrained by topography, or the existing development pattern. The City shall determine whether access will be by right-of-way or vehicular access tract on a case-by-case basis; provided, that in no instance shall a vehicular access tract serve more than four lots.

(2) An owned vehicular access having a minimum width of 20 feet shall be permitted to serve one lot only (e.g., panhandle or flag lot). The area of the vehicular access strip shall not be included in the computation of lot area.

(3) No lot shall have an easement across another lot for vehicular access.

(4) Access to lots which abut two or more rights-of-way or vehicular access tracts shall be established on a case-by-case basis. Generally, lots shall obtain access from the right-of-way having the least amount of through traffic. [Ord. 1585 § 102, 2013.]


17.35.080 Access – Rights-of-way.

(1) General. All rights-of-way within and abutting the subdivision shall be improved in accordance with the standards set forth in chapter 12.15 DMMC.

(2) Designation of Rights-of-Way. If a new right-of-way is proposed within a subdivision, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director shall classify the right-of-way based on the projections for that right-of-way using the right-of-way definitions established in “City of Des Moines Street Development Standards” as adopted by chapter 12.15 DMMC.

(3) Dedication. The City may require the dedication of rights-of-way to serve adjacent properties in order to provide a safe and efficient circulation system within the City.

(4) Construction of Street System Improvements on Rights-of-Way Abutting the Subdivision and Off-Site from the Subdivision. Such street system improvements as are defined in Title 12 DMMC shall be constructed on rights-of-way abutting the subdivision and off-site from the subdivision as directed by the City Council in the course of discretionary review of the subdivision. The subdivision applicant required to construct off-site street system improvements are entitled to reimbursement as provided in Title 12 DMMC.

(5) Modifications. The applicant may request and the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may grant a modification of the right-of-way improvements defined in the current Street Development Standards for subdivisions that do not yield more than two lots based upon the following criteria:

(a) The subdivision contains less than 100 lineal feet of street frontage and would not match existing improvements; or

(b) The subdivision does not front on a street identified in the Priority Pedestrian Network in the current Comprehensive Transportation Plan and would not match existing improvements; or

(c) The subdivision does not front on a street identified in the Priority Pedestrian Network in the current Comprehensive Transportation Plan and unusual topographic or physical conditions preclude the construction of the improvements as required. [Ord. 1585 § 103, 2013.]


17.35.090 Access – Private streets within vehicular access tracts.

(1) General. If vehicular access within the subdivision will be provided by means other than rights-of-way, the subdivision shall establish tracts which provide the legal right of access to each of the lots served and establish joint maintenance responsibilities. The City may require that the legal right of access be granted to other adjoining properties in order to provide a safe and efficient circulation system within the City. The ownership of vehicular access tracts is shared by owners of all lots having the right to access through the tracts.

(2) Private Streets. All private streets within the subdivision shall be improved in accordance with the standards set forth in chapter 12.15 DMMC.

(3) Other Improvements. The City may require additional or other requirements for private streets within vehicular access tracts, if necessary to address unusual circumstances.

(4) Lot Area. The area of vehicular access tracts shall not be included in the computation of lot area for any lot. [Ord. 1585 § 104, 2013.]


17.35.100 Access – Pedestrian ways.

The City may require the installation of pedestrian ways within dedicated rights-of-way or tracts in any of the following circumstances:

(1) If a pedestrian way is indicated as appropriate in the Comprehensive Plan.

(2) If the pedestrian way is reasonably necessary to provide efficient pedestrian access to a school, park, business district, or transit stop or to integrate pedestrian travel throughout the neighborhood.

(3) To provide a midblock connection between parallel streets where the total length of a block is 750 feet or more. [Ord. 1585 § 105, 2013.]


17.35.110 Utilities and related improvements – General.

(a) The systems are located within the one-half of the right-of-way which does not abut the subdivision; or

(b) The existing above-ground system cannot be undergrounded without either adding a new utility pole or undergrounding systems on private property not within the subdivision. When existing above-ground utility systems are not required to be undergrounded, conduit shall be installed within the abutting right-of-way in accordance with utility standards, as necessary to preclude excavation within the right-of-way at such time as undergrounding is feasible.

(2) Exceptions. The following electrical and communication systems shall not be required to be installed underground:

(a) Electrical utility substations, pad-mounted transformers and switching facilities not located on the public right-of-way and where site screening is or will be provided in accordance with design review standards;

18.01.010 Title.

This Title shall be known as “Zoning.” This chapter shall be entitled “General Provisions.” [Ord. 1591 § 1, 2014.]


18.01.020 Application.

This chapter shall be applicable to all chapters contained within this Title. The provisions adopted by this Title shall be applicable to all zones in the City and all zoning actions, as specified in this Title. [Ord. 1591 § 2, 2014.]


18.01.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this Title is to implement the purposes of the Comprehensive Plan and to classify uses and to regulate the location of such uses in such manner as to group as nearly as possible those uses which are mutually compatible, and to protect each such group of uses from the intrusion of incompatible uses which would damage the security and stability of land and improvements and which would also prevent the greatest practical convenience and service to the citizens of Des Moines. It is also recognized that intrusion of uses in one zone upon uses in another lighter zone may also result from effects reaching across boundary lines separating contiguous zones due to noise, smoke, equipment, open air activity, or other features. To further accomplish the goal of compatibility, varying degrees of regulations are established for certain uses in the Commercial and Business Park Zones when such uses are contiguous to lighter zones. A further purpose of this Title is to make it possible for Des Moines to efficiently and economically design, install, and operate physical public service facilities in terms of type, size, and capacity, including streets, sewers, drains, schools and other public buildings, to adequately and permanently meet the ultimate requirements as determined by a defined intensity and type of land use; to require an orderly arrangement of essential related facilities with particular reference to the movement of people and goods, including the traffic pattern and well-located and well-designed off-street parking areas and, through the medium of the zoning map which is a part of this Title, to establish the geographical location and boundaries of the zones to which the different zones will apply.

A further purpose of this Title is to establish required minimum lot area, yards and open spaces as a means of providing a suitable environment for living, business and industry, and to maintain reasonable population densities and reasonable intensities of land use, all for the general purpose of conserving public health, safety, morals, convenience, and general welfare. [Ord. 1591 § 3, 2014.]


18.01.040 Authority.

This Title is created pursuant to the authority set forth in chapters 35A.63, 36.70A, 36.70B, and 36.70C RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1591 § 4, 2014.]

18.05.080 Names of zones.

To accomplish the purpose of this Title, the following use zones are established and regulations are set forth therein defining the permissible uses, the height and bulk of buildings, the area of yards and other open spaces about buildings, and the density of population; such zones are known as follows:

18.05.100 If only one building on a lot or building site, it constitutes a main building.

Any building which is the only building on a lot or building site is a main building unless otherwise authorized by variance. No accessory building or use is allowed on a lot or building site unless the primary use to which it is accessory exists on the same lot or building site. [Ord. 1591 § 23, 2014.]


18.05.110 Zone of unlisted uses and clarification of ambiguity.

(1) In creating zones, the City Council has considered the characteristics of uses which make them comparable, compatible, or similar. The City Council recognizes that it is not possible to enumerate and classify every use to which land may be devoted, either now or in the future, and that ambiguity may exist with reference to the appropriate and consistent zone of a use. Therefore:

(a) When any known and identifiable use is not listed as a permissible use in any zone; or

(b) When any use has now come into existence by reason of any technical development in the trades, sciences, and equipment; or

(c) When any use already listed in the zone which, because of any process, equipment, or materials used, possesses different performance standards than those which are usually associated with the uses in the zone as presently classified and which, therefore, makes it reasonable that such a use should be placed in the more restrictive zone.

(2) It shall be the responsibility and duty of the Planning, Building and Public Works Department to ascertain all pertinent facts relating to any such use and make what it deems to be the appropriate recommendation for zoning. Any proceedings under this section shall be processed as an amendment. [Ord. 1591 § 24, 2014.]


18.05.120 Uncertainty of boundaries.

Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zone shown upon the zoning map or any part or unit thereof, the following rules shall apply:

(1) Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following street or alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries;

(2) In the case of unsubdivided property, and where a zone boundary divides such property, the location of such boundaries, unless the same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map;

(3) Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the area comprising such vacated street or alley shall acquire the zone of the property to which it reverts;

(4) Where a lot subdivided and recorded subsequent to the zoning of the area in which it is located becomes so placed that it is unequally bisected longitudinally by the boundary lines of different zones, the zone boundary shall be considered as following the lot lines of the lot in such manner as to place the lot wholly in that zone which applies to the major portion of the lot;

(5) Where property abuts a lake, river, or body of water, the zone shall extend to the inner harbor line and where no harbor line exists, to a line which the Corps of Engineers would define as the line of navigability;

(6) Where a lot is equally bisected longitudinally by a zone boundary line, the total lot shall acquire the most restrictive zone and the highest area requirement of the two zones involved;

(7) Where a lot is bisected by the boundary line between two zones and such boundary line parallels or approximately parallels the street on which such lot fronts, the total area of such bisected lot shall acquire the same zone requirement as the front portion of the lot. This provision shall not apply to through lots. [Ord. 1591 § 25, 2014.]


18.05.130 Property not zoned.

Any property which, for any reason other than the fact that it is a right-of-way of a street, alley, or railroad, is located within an adopted part of the zoning map but is not designated as being zoned shall be deemed to be zoned RS-15,000. [Ord. 1591 § 26, 2014.]


18.05.140 Classification of rights-of-way.

Areas of streets or alleys and railroad rights-of-way, other than such as are designated on the zoning map as being classified in one of the zones provided in this Title, shall be deemed to be unclassified and, in the case of streets, permitted to be used only for street purposes as defined by law, and in the case of railroad rights-of-way, permitted to be used solely for the purpose of accommodating tracks, signals, other operating devices, the movement of rolling stock, public utility lines, and facilities accessory to and used directly for the delivery, distribution, or rendering of services to bordering land uses. [Ord. 1591 § 27, 2014.]


18.05.150 Lot area requirement symbol.

In the Single-Family Residential Zone where a number follows the indicated zone on the zoning map such number shall indicate which of the minimum lot area, yards, and open spaces required in the zone applies to the properties involved. [Ord. 1591 § 28, 2014.]


18.05.160 Limitation of land use.

Except as provided in this Title, no building or structure shall be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered, nor shall any building, structure, or land be used for any purpose except as specifically provided in this Title and allowed in the zone in which such building, land, or use is located. [Ord. 1591 § 29, 2014.]


18.05.170 Individual lot on building site is unit of application.

Unless otherwise specifically stated in this Title, an individual lot or building site as each is defined in this Title is intended to be the unit to which all of the provisions, requirements, permitted uses, yards, and open spaces apply. [Ord. 1591 § 30, 2014.]

If a use originally authorized by a variance, conditional use permit, or other valid use permit prior to August 3, 1964, is located within a zone in which such use is not permitted by the terms of this Title, such use shall be a nonconforming use. Uses validly established prior to August 3, 1964, shall not be deemed nonconforming only because of failure to secure a conditional use permit required under this Title.

(3) If a building, structure or land becomes nonconforming solely because of governmental acquisition of a portion of the property for an essential public transportation facility, the property shall be a legal nonconforming lot and the building, structure or use may continue.

[Ord. 1695 § 2, 2017: Ord. 1591 § 39, 2014.]


18.15.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority set forth in DMMC 18.01.040. [Ord. 1591 § 40, 2014.]


18.15.050 Effect of removal or destruction of nonconforming buildings.

(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, if any nonconforming building is, in the judgment of the Planning, Building and Public Works Director, removed, destroyed by means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, every future building constructed, reconstructed or otherwise permitted to remain on the land on which the building was located shall conform to the provisions of this Title.

(2) In a Single-Family Residential Zone, nonconforming single-family residential buildings partially destroyed by catastrophe or disaster such as fire, explosion, earthquake, flooding, etc., may be reconstructed as existed prior to the catastrophic event, subject to the following limitations:

(a) This subsection shall not apply to reconstruction voluntarily initiated by the property owner.

(b) The work must be vested by permit application within one year of such happening and any restoration or reconstruction not vested by permit application within 12 months from the date of the fire or other casualty shall be deemed abandoned and not allowed to be restored.

(g) Reconstructed building area shall conform to the requirements of Title 14 DMMC, Buildings and Construction. [Ord. 1655 § 4, 2016: Ord. 1591 § 42, 2014.]


18.15.070 Structural alteration or enlargement of nonconforming buildings.

(1) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Title, nonconforming buildings may not be enlarged or structurally altered unless an enlargement or structural alteration makes the building more conforming, or is required by law; however, where a building or buildings and customary accessory buildings are nonconforming only by reason of substandard yards, open spaces, area, or height, the provisions of this Title prohibiting structural alterations or enlargements shall not apply; provided, any structural alterations or enlargements of an existing building under such circumstances shall not increase the degree of nonconformity and any enlargements or new buildings and structures shall observe the yards and open spaces required.

(2) Structural alterations may be permitted if necessary to adapt a nonconforming building to new technologies or equipment pertaining to uses housed in such building. Any enlargement necessary to adapt to new technologies shall be authorized only by a variance.

(3) Upkeep, repairing, and maintenance of nonconforming buildings is permitted. [Ord. 1591 § 43, 2014.]


18.15.080 Required conformance of existing uses required to be in entirely enclosed building.

Where this Title requires a use to be contained within an entirely enclosed building as such term is defined in this Title, and a use existing on August 3, 1964, is not in an entirely enclosed building, the building or structure containing such use shall be made to conform to the requirements of this Title with respect to such enclosure within a period of not more than three years from the date of notification as required in DMMC 18.15.110. [Ord. 1591 § 44, 2014.]


18.15.090 Required conformance to exterior improvements.

Where a use exists on August 3, 1964, and such use is nonconforming only because it does not meet the requirements of this Title with respect to improvement of outside areas used for storage, parking, or outside activities, or if the property on which any use is located has a property line common with residential property and no wall, fence, or hedge exists on such property line where required by this Title, such use shall be made to conform to the requirements of this Title with respect to such features within a period of not to exceed two years from the date of notification as required in DMMC 18.15.110. [Ord. 1591 § 45, 2014.]


18.15.100 Continuation of nonconforming use in a nonconforming building.

(1) A nonconforming use in a nonconforming building may be continued, and may be expanded or extended throughout such building so long as such nonconforming building remains nonconforming; provided, no structural alterations or additions are made except those that may be required by law or which are specifically permitted in this chapter. A nonconforming use in a nonconforming building may be changed to another use of the same or more conforming zone.

(2) The permission to continue the nonconforming use in a nonconforming building shall not apply where the building is nonconforming only by reason of substandard yards, open space, area, or height, in which case the use shall be abated in the same manner as provided in DMMC 18.15.110. [Ord. 1591 § 46, 2014.]


18.15.110 Abatement of nonconforming uses.

Nonconforming uses of land, buildings, or structures shall be subject to abatement as follows:

(1) By resolution of the City Council, the Hearing Examiner shall be directed to conduct a public hearing, which shall be evidentiary in nature, to take testimony relative to abatement schedules for any class of nonconforming use. The Hearing Examiner shall schedule a public hearing within 45 days of receipt of such resolution. Notice of the public hearing shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the City not less than 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing date and by mailing an appropriate notice, by certified mail, within 15 days of the hearing date to the owner of record and to the occupant/tenant of real property which may be affected by the proceedings. Thereafter, the Hearing Examiner shall conduct a public hearing and evidentiary hearing in general conformity with the Hearing Examiner code. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall transmit findings and recommendations to the City Council. Such findings and recommendations shall be based on the factors described in subsection (3) of this section.

(2) Upon receipt of the findings and recommendations of the Hearing Examiner, the City Council shall set a public hearing to consider the issue, giving again such public notice as is described in subsection (1) of this section. Abatement proceedings shall not be subject to the one open record public hearing requirement for a proposed land use action specified in chapter 18.20 DMMC, Land Use Review Procedures. All persons wishing to be heard shall be heard; provided, however, testimony and evidence may not go beyond the scope of that presented to the Hearing Examiner. Following such public hearing, the City Council shall adopt by ordinance an appropriate abatement period for the nonconforming use.

(3) The period of abatement for a nonconforming use shall be determined by providing a sufficient residue of reasonable use through “amortization of nonconforming uses.” Factors that may be considered in establishing the abatement period through amortization are investment of the property owner, estimated remaining economic life of investment, depreciated value from federal income tax records, value and condition of the improvement, nature of the use, possibility of alternative uses that conform or that are more conforming, degree of incompatibility of the use with current zoning, impact of the use on other uses in the area where it is located, existence or nonexistence of a lease and contingency clauses permitting lease termination, and such other factors that tend to permit the nonconforming user to amortize investment during the period of permitted nonconformity, bearing in mind that the public interest in eliminating undesirable nonconforming uses is sufficient to justify the reduction of property value. [Ord. 1591 § 47, 2014.]


18.15.120 Nonconforming churches may alter or expand.

Nonconforming churches may be structurally altered or enlarged; provided, the requirements of this Title for off-street parking shall be met and maintained for any seating capacity in excess of that which existed immediately prior to the alterations or additions whether provided by additional seats in the nave or by additional floor space to be used simultaneously for assembly purposes if there are no fixed seats. [Ord. 1591 § 48, 2014.]


18.15.130 Residences and dwelling units in Commercial Zones nonconforming.

Residential buildings and buildings containing dwelling units on the ground floor existing in Commercial Zones on August 3, 1964, shall be considered as nonconforming buildings but, as such, shall be subject only to those provisions of this chapter pertaining to abatement which provide that a nonconforming building removed or destroyed shall not be replaced by other than a conforming building, that the nonconforming building may not be enlarged or expanded unless such enlargement or expansion makes the building more conforming, and that the degree of nonconformity may not be increased by changing to a less restrictive residential use. [Ord. 1591 § 49, 2014.]


18.15.140 Dwelling units in Commercial Zones nonconforming.

Dwelling units in Commercial Zones existing on February 4, 1985, shall be considered nonconforming uses and shall be subject to DMMC 18.15.130, governing nonconforming residential uses in Commercial Zones; provided, however, should any dwelling unit or building containing a dwelling unit be damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, or other casualty or act of God or the public enemy, it may be restored and the occupancy or use which existed at the time of such damage or destruction may be continued. [Ord. 1591 § 50, 2014.]

18.20.010 Title.

This chapter shall be entitled “Land Use Review Procedures.” [Ord. 1591 § 51, 2014.]


18.20.020 Application.

This chapter shall apply to the processing and appeal of all land use actions as defined by RCW 36.70B.030 unless specifically excluded herein. [Ord. 1591 § 52, 2014.]


18.20.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish standard procedures for land use and related development decisions made by the City. The procedures are designed to promote timely and informed public participation, eliminate redundancy in the application, land use review, and appeal processes, minimize delay and expense, and result in land use actions that further the City goals, policies, and strategies as set forth in the City of Des Moines Comprehensive Plan. As required by RCW 36.70B.060, these procedures provide for an integrated and consolidated land use review process. The procedures integrate the environmental review process specified in Title 16 DMMC, Environment, with the procedures for land use actions specified in Title 14 DMMC, Buildings and Construction, Title 17 DMMC, Subdivisions, and this Title, and provide for the consolidation of appeal processes for land use actions. [Ord. 1591 § 53, 2014.]


18.20.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority set forth in DMMC 18.01.040. [Ord. 1591 § 54, 2014.]


18.20.050 Concurrent review.

Except when a land use action is categorically exempt from SEPA, environmental review shall be conducted concurrently with review of other proposed land use actions requested by an applicant.

When a proposed development requires more than one land use action, the applicant may request concurrent review of all proposed land use actions. [Ord. 1591 § 55, 2014.]


18.20.060 Exempt actions.

(1) As authorized by RCW 36.70B.140(1), the following land use actions are not subject to the provisions of RCW 36.70B.070, 36.70B.080, 36.70B.090, 36.70B.110, 36.70B.120, and 36.70B.130 because the City Council has determined that these projects present special circumstances that warrant a review process different from the process specified by this chapter:

(a) Business Park and Institutional Campus (I-C) master plans (DMMC 18.105.050);

(b) Street vacations and other actions relating to use of public areas or facilities (Title 12 DMMC);

(c) Type VI land use actions (DMMC 18.20.210); and

(d) Abatement of nonconforming uses (DMMC 18.15.110).

(2) As authorized by RCW 36.70B.140(2), the following Type I land use actions shall not be subject to the provisions of RCW 36.70B.060, 36.70B.110, 36.70B.120, and 36.70B.130:

(a) Lot line adjustments (chapter 17.25 DMMC).

(b) Construction permits required under Title 14 DMMC that are categorically exempt from environmental review under chapter 16.05 DMMC, SEPA, or for which environmental review has been completed in conjunction with other project permits. [Ord. 1655 § 5, 2016: Ord. 1591 § 56, 2014.]


18.20.070 Land use classifications.

Land use actions are classified into six types, based upon the entity responsible for the decision, the amount of discretion exercised by the decision maker, the degree of impact associated with the decision, the amount and type of public input sought, and the type of appeal available. The six categories of land use actions are as follows:

(1) Type I. Administrative decision made without legal requirement for public comment.

(2) Type II. Administrative decision made after legally required opportunity for public comment.

(3) Type III. Quasi-judicial and other decisions by Hearing Examiner made after legally required opportunity for public comment.

(4) Type IV. Quasi-judicial and other nonlegislative decisions by City Council made after legally required opportunity for public comment.

(5) Type V. Quasi-judicial and other nonlegislative decisions by City Council made without legal requirement for public comment.

(6) Type VI. Legislative decision by City Council made after legally required opportunity for public comment. [Ord. 1591 § 57, 2014.]


18.20.080 Project review.

This chapter shall be entitled “Waiver of Zoning Requirements and Variances.” [Ord. 1591 § 105, 2014.]


18.35.020 Application.

In those instances where the City Council has passed an ordinance amending the zoning map and such amendment has restricted the use of the rezoned property, by ordinance or concomitant agreement or development agreement pursuant to RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210, to a specified and unified project in accordance with plans and specifications incorporated by reference in the ordinance granting the zoning amendment, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall have the authority to waive certain setback requirements as described in DMMC 18.35.050. [Ord. 1591 § 106, 2014.]


18.35.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to allow a limited waiver of setback requirements as described in DMMC 18.35.050 as in specific circumstances set forth below. [Ord. 1591 § 107, 2014.]


18.35.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1591 § 108, 2014.]


18.35.050 Setback requirements – Waiver limitations.

The setback requirements which may be waived are the open spaces between buildings which are required where lots have been short platted and which would not have been required if the lots had not been short platted. Prior to granting the setback requirement waiver, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee must be satisfied that the waiver is consistent with and effectuates the intent of the City Council in granting the project zoning. [Ord. 1591 § 109, 2014.]

Any person aggrieved by the decision of the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee in either granting or denying a setback requirement waiver in accordance with this chapter may appeal such decision to the Hearing Examiner by filing such appeal in writing with the City Clerk within 10 days of the rendering of such decision. Such appeal shall be in accordance with chapter 18.240 DMMC. [Ord. 1591 § 110, 2014.]


18.35.070 Variance criteria.

The Hearing Examiner may grant a variance, in specific cases, from the provisions of the zoning ordinance or other land use regulatory ordinances as the City may adopt, which will not be contrary to the public interest; but only where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of such ordinance(s) would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the provisions of such ordinance(s) shall not be granted by the Hearing Examiner unless the Hearing Examiner finds that all of the following facts and conditions exist:

(1) The variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property on behalf of which the application was filed is located; and

(2) That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located; and

(3) That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; and

(4) That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; and

(5) The authorization of such variance will not adversely affect the implementation of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan; and

(6) That the granting of such a variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant possessed by the owners of the other property in the same zone or vicinity; and

(7) No conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same zone, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other zones, shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance; and

(8) In granting any variance, the Hearing Examiner may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance or other land use regulatory ordinances as the City may adopt. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this section; and

(9) With respect to uses of land, buildings, and other structures, this section is declared to be a definition of the public interest by the City Council, and the spirit of this section will be controverted by any variance which permits a use not generally or by special exception permitted in the zone involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited, by the terms of this section in the zone; and

(10) Therefore, under no circumstances shall the Hearing Examiner grant a variance to permit a use not generally or by special exception permitted in the zone involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited, by the terms of the zoning ordinance in the zone. [Ord. 1591 § 111, 2014.]

Sections

18.120.010    Purpose of zone.

18.120.020    Permitted uses.

18.120.030    Limitations on permitted uses.

18.120.010 Purpose of zone.

The purpose of this zone and its application is to provide for the location of and grouping of enterprises which may involve some on-premises retail service but with outside activities and display or fabrication, assembling, and service features, including manufacturing and processing in limited degree, and which uses, if permitted to locate in strictly on-premises retail and service areas, would introduce factors of heavy trucking and handling of materials that destroy the maximum service and attraction of strictly retail areas. The uses enumerated in this zone are considered as having common or similar performance standards in that:

(1) They are heavier in type than those uses permitted in the strictly Commercial Zones and yet are measurably lighter uses than those first permitted in the Business Park Zones;

(2) They do not attract nor depend upon individual and personal patron contact on the premises to the same degree as do uses in strictly retail and service areas but, rather, represent in part enterprises whose services are either performed away from the premises and throughout the metropolitan area or enterprises in which the manufacturing, assembling, processing, or treating of products is not accessory or limited to products sold on the premises only as is required in retail and service areas;

(3) They can more advantageously use the standard lot and street pattern than can strictly industrial uses;

(4) They involve a greater handling of materials and commodities and more trucking than uses permitted in a strictly retail area, but do not require large sites nor involve as much handling of materials and commodities or heavy trucking as uses first permitted in strictly industrial areas;

(5) They are not as detrimentally affected by dispersal or separation from adjoining uses as are enterprises which are retail in nature and which need to be located in compact areas for convenient patron access;

(6) They do not normally involve as intensive use of land as uses comprising retail shopping areas;

(7) They frequently involve activities carried on outside of buildings;

(8) By reason of technological processes, equipment, materials used, outside activities or size or volume of products, a given type of enterprise may, under various names, represent extremes that necessitate different zone. For this reason a clearer identification of uses permitted in this zone is accomplished by naming typical uses to further indicate the type and grouping of uses allowed, as well as by establishing performance standards. [Ord. 1591 § 281, 2014.]

[Ord. 1591 § 284, 2014.]


18.120.040 Permissible floor area.

The maximum permitted floor area to be contained in all buildings on a lot in a C-G Zone shall not exceed three and one-half times the square foot area of the lot. [Ord. 1591 § 285, 2014.]


18.120.050 Height.

In a C-G Zone no building or structure shall exceed a height of 35 feet. [Ord. 1591 § 286, 2014.]


18.120.060 Required open spaces.

Additional open spaces, both as to amount and location on the premises may be required in connection with an unclassified use permit, variance, or planned unit development to apply the established requirements of this and other related codes pertaining to such subjects as off-street parking, loading areas, convenient and safe circulation of vehicles and pedestrians, ingress and egress as related to the marginal traffic pattern, vision clearance (traffic), drainage, and lighting.

Placement of buildings and structures including additions to existing buildings or structures, excluding signs, shall maintain minimum setbacks established by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director based on the following criteria:

(1) When the front or side lot line abuts the public right-of-way, the building or structure shall abut the public right-of-way unless:

(a) Subsection (2) of this section requires that the building or structure be set back; or

(b) Through the permitting process, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director finds it is in the public interest to allow the proposed building or structure to be set back from the right-of-way. In considering a request for setback, the Director shall consider matters such as adopted land use policies, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, landscaping, existing site improvements, adjacent site improvements, and public benefit features such as plazas and public artwork. Decisions of the director regarding setbacks are appealable to the Hearing Examiner pursuant to chapter 18.94 DMMC.

(2) Where any lot line lies adjacent to a public right-of-way or private street and residentially zoned property lies adjacent to such public right-of-way or private street, or when the lot line abuts a residentially zoned property, a minimum building or structure setback of 10 feet shall be maintained. [Ord. 1591 § 287, 2014.]


18.120.080 Internal walkways.

In order to encourage safe pedestrian circulation through the siting of buildings, walkways shall be constructed on each property being newly developed or materially remodeled, enlarged, or repaired to the extent of 50 percent of the value of the existing structure(s) as hereinafter provided. In the case of a series of additions, alterations, or repair projects, this section shall become effective at the point where in any three-year period the cumulative value of additions, alterations, or repairs exceeds 50 percent of the value of the structure(s) at the time such additions, alterations, or repairs are commenced.

(1) Walkways Around Buildings. Pedestrian walkways shall be provided at or around the building(s) of sufficient extent to provide safe pedestrian passage; provided, however, where no side or rear yard exists, no walkway will be required along those portions of the building abutting the lot line. A minimum six-foot walkway shall be required adjacent to the principal entrance to the building(s).

(2) Street Sidewalk Connections. A minimum six-foot pedestrian walkway shall be provided which connects walkways at the building to street sidewalks. Where no street sidewalk exists, the connecting walk shall extend to the street right-of-way.

(3) Connection to Adjoining Properties. Walkways shall be provided which connect to adjoining properties in locations on, or as near as possible to, desired lines of pedestrian traffic in accordance with the comprehensive walkway plan. A minimum six-foot walkway shall be required between adjacent building fronts. Alternate routes or branch connections to perimeter or other walkways shall be a minimum of five feet in width.

(4) Coordination with Circulation System. All such required pedestrian walks shall be located and constructed as an integral part of the total coordinated pedestrian circulation system.

(5) Design Standards.

(a) Surface. Walkways shall be paved with hard-surfaced material such as concrete, stone, brick, tile, etc. Walkways shall be clearly defined and differentiated from parking and vehicle circulation areas by use of contrasting paving, such as white concrete in an asphalt area, visually obvious paint stripes, or other clearly defined pattern. Where paint is used, the property owner shall be responsible for maintaining the paint to achieve the intent of this section.

(b) Stairs. Where stairs are employed, the riser to thread proportion shall be designed to normal stair standards or be clearly monumental in proportion. Handrails shall be provided where the number of risers or adjoining grade difference requires the protection afforded by rails, as determined by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director. Any flight of stairs within 15 feet of any other flight of stairs, if it is on a pedestrian route, shall have the same riser and thread dimensions.

(c) Lighting. Night lighting shall be provided where stairs, curbs, ramps, or abrupt changes in walkway direction occur. Light fixtures shall not exceed a height of 14 feet. Provision of special accent or feature lighting is encouraged.

(d) Covering. Walks should be covered by marquees or other roof structures where possible and practical. Roofed and walled passageways between or through buildings shall be ample in width, as determined by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director (width as proportioned to length) and night lighted.

This chapter shall apply to all areas zoned H-C Highway Commercial. [Ord. 1591 § 290, 2014.]


18.125.030 Purpose.

The intent of this zone is to provide for the location and grouping of diversified commercial/retail activities which serve a broader, regional clientele, involving some on-premises retail service but requiring more convenience for vehicular circulation. These uses depend on proximity to major highways or arterials for trade or transportation, are characterized by less dependence on individual and personal patron contact than uses in retail zones, and involve outside activities and display or fabrication, assembling, and service features. Uses enumerated in this zone have common or similar performance standards in that they are heavier in type than those uses permitted in the more restrictive Commercial Zones and often are not compatible with uses permitted in other Commercial Zones because of the type of commodities and goods handled, greater handling of materials and commodities, increased trucking activity, need for larger sites, and noise, traffic, or other impacts generated. Uses are measurably lighter uses than typical of Business Park Zones; however, they do not normally involve as intensive use of land as those comprising the retail shopping area. [Ord. 1591 § 291, 2014.]


18.125.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1591 § 292, 2014.]

Every use locating in the H-C Highway Commercial Zone shall be subject to the following conditions and limitations:

(1) Automobile Service Stations. Buildings, structures, and the leading edge of pump islands shall not be closer than 20 feet to any street property line, except that service station canopies and marquees may project 10 feet into the required setback.

(2) If a building site has a boundary line which is a common property line with residential property, then on such common line a wall or view-obscuring fence or hedge not less than five feet in height shall be installed and maintained for screening purposes and controlling access. [Ord. 1591 § 293, 2014.]


18.125.060 Permissible floor area.

The maximum permitted floor area to be contained in all buildings on a lot in an H-C Highway Commercial Zone shall not exceed three and one-half times the square foot area of the lot. [Ord. 1591 § 294, 2014.]


18.125.070 Height.

In an H-C Highway Commercial Zone no building or structure shall exceed a height of 35 feet. [Ord. 1591 § 295, 2014.]


18.125.080 Placement of buildings and structures.

Placement of buildings and structures on any lot in the H-C Highway Commercial Zone shall conform to the following:

(1) Front Setback. Any building or structure, except signs or service station canopies or marquees, shall maintain a 60-foot minimum setback.

(2) Rear Setback. A minimum 10-foot rear setback shall be maintained from any residential property.

(3) Side Setback. A minimum 10-foot side setback shall be maintained from any residential property. [Ord. 1591 § 296, 2014.]


18.125.090 Landscaping requirements.

Landscaping in the H-C Highway Commercial Zone shall be required as set forth in chapter 18.195 DMMC. [Ord. 1591 § 297, 2014.]

This chapter shall be entitled “W-C Woodmont Commercial Zone.” [Ord. 1618-A § 1, 2015.]


18.127.020 Application.

This chapter shall apply to all areas zoned W-C Woodmont Commercial. [Ord. 1618-A § 2, 2015.]


18.127.030 Purpose.

The W-C Commercial Zone is primarily intended to enhance, promote and maintain commercial business areas, and to ensure land use compatibility among businesses in terms of permitted uses, building height, bulk, and scale; to provide a commercial area that reflects its commercial-oriented function; to serve the general public; and to ensure that development occurs consistent with the goals, policies, and implementation strategies of the City of Des Moines Comprehensive Plan. South of South 268th Street, the zone allows for a more intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual support of public investments and private development, while acknowledging the existing businesses along the State Route 99 corridor that serve a broader, regional clientele. Uses and development are regulated to create a moderately dense built-up environment, oriented to pedestrians, and ensuring a density and intensity that is transit supportive. [Ord. 1656 § 1, 2016: Ord. 1618-A § 3, 2015.]


18.127.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1618-A § 4, 2015.]


18.127.050 Environmental performance standards and general limitations.

(1) Every use permitted within the W-C Zone pursuant to this chapter shall conform to the following general limitations and standards:

(a) As provided by chapter 9.64 DMMC, no use, activity, or equipment shall be permitted that creates a nuisance or is offensive, objectionable, or hazardous by reason of creation of odors, noise, sound, vibrations, dust, dirt, smoke, or other pollutants, noxious, toxic, or corrosive fumes or gases, radiation, explosion or fire hazard, or by reason of the generation, disposal, or storage of hazardous or dangerous wastes or materials in a manner(s) inconsistent with Title 70 RCW as presently constituted or as may be subsequently amended;

(b) Accessory uses are permitted that are customarily appurtenant or incidental to the principally permitted uses;

(iv) Motor vehicle fuel pumps;

(v) Display of merchandise sold on-site;

(vi) Play/recreation areas; and

(vii) Miscellaneous storage when limited to 25 percent of the site area and when perimeter landscaping and fencing is provided;

(e) In reviewing a proposed permitted use, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may waive or include minimal conditions as may be reasonably needed to ensure that the use is consistent with the purpose of the W-C Zone, and to minimize the likelihood of adverse impacts. [Ord. 1618-A § 5, 2015.] 


18.127.060 Dimensional standards.

(1) Maximum Building Height. Buildings and structures may be built to 55 feet, except that buildings and structures south of South 268th Street may be built to 70 feet.

(a) No minimum building height for commercial projects, and 55 feet for residential or mixed use projects.

(b) For the purposes of this subsection, minimum building height shall not include decorative towers or appurtenances, roof slopes out of character with the building’s architecture, or other contrivances provided solely for achievement of the required minimum building height. In calculating minimum building height, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall include regular architectural features enclosing functional, occupiable building areas.

(3) Building Height Limitation Adjacent to Single-Family. When an abutting property is zoned Single-Family Residential, building height shall be limited as follows:

(a) Every lot shall have a rear yard setback of not less than 20 feet when abutting single-family zoned properties, except as otherwise permitted in subsection (7) of this section.

(b) Within 40 feet of the abutting Single-Family Residential Zone, maximum building height shall be 45 feet.

(c) During the design review and environmental review, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may impose other conditions of approval in order to mitigate potential height, bulk, and scale impacts upon adjacent single-family residents not sufficiently mitigated by existing regulations.

(4) Front Yard. No front yard setback is required.

(5) Side Yard. Every lot shall have a side yard of not less than 20 feet when abutting single-family zoned properties, except as otherwise permitted in subsection (7) of this section.

(9) Height Allowance for Enhanced Design of Distinctive Rooflines. A portion of a building may exceed the maximum building height; provided, that the following provisions are met:

(a) The purpose of the additional height for the building is to provide a roofline that is of distinctive form through the use of design elements such as pitched roofs, sloped roofs, vertical offsets or other similar roof features that achieve the goals of the design guidelines in DMMC 18.136.070.

(b) The maximum building height established in subsections (1) and (3) of this section shall only be increased by a maximum of 10 percent.

(c) Architectural features associated with the distinctive roofline shall be used to emphasize significant architectural elements of the building such as the main entrance of the building or the building’s orientation to a corner, or to provide for pitched or sloped roofs for the building.

(d) Height allowed for distinctive rooflines under this section shall not be used to determine the building height for the purposes of establishing the maximum gross floor area under DMMC 18.136.070(3).

(e) The building area or amount of building structure extending above the maximum height established in subsection (3) of this section shall be limited to 30 percent of the building roof deck area. When multiple building rooflines exist at different building levels or stories, the 30 percent requirement shall only apply to the area of the roof deck of the tallest portion of a building. [Ord. 1656 § 2, 2016: Ord. 1618-A § 6, 2015.]

18.135.010 Title.

This chapter shall be entitled “Pacific Ridge Zone.” [Ord. 1591 § 311, 2014.]


18.135.020 Application.

This chapter shall apply to all areas zoned PR Pacific Ridge. [Ord. 1591 § 312, 2014.]


18.135.030 Purpose.

The principal objective and purpose of this zone and its application is to implement the City of Des Moines Comprehensive Plan, Pacific Ridge Neighborhood Improvement Plan, and other adopted policies for the commercial and residential areas of Pacific Ridge.

Furthermore, it is the objective and purpose of this zone to provide development regulations that will promote redevelopment of Pacific Ridge properties in order to create attractive, safe, and desirable areas to work and reside. Redevelopment of Pacific Ridge is appropriate because this area has excellent access to transportation facilities, view opportunities, and higher-density development which can help Des Moines meet or exceed population and employment growth targets specified by the countywide planning policies for King County. Also, redevelopment of Pacific Ridge properties is appropriate because many of the existing structures and land uses have resulted in social problems such as: high crime rates (especially major felony crimes); declining property values; unsafe and undesirable housing conditions; insufficient building and property maintenance; absentee property ownership/management; violation of zoning, construction, and health codes; transient residency; and marginal businesses.

A related consideration is to make it possible to efficiently and economically plan for, design, finance, and provide public services, capital facilities, and utilities for the populations and activities within this zone. For all of the above reasons, the purpose of this chapter is to promote public health, safety, and welfare through redevelopment of Pacific Ridge properties. [Ord. 1591 § 313, 2014.]


18.135.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1591 § 314, 2014.]

18.155.030 Purpose.

This chapter is intended to provide recreation areas for residents of multifamily developments, to separate such areas from automobile-oriented areas, and to enhance the quality of multifamily residential developments, thus promoting the public health, safety, and welfare of the community of Des Moines. [Ord. 1591 § 345, 2014.]


18.155.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1591 § 346, 2014.]


18.155.050 Minimum area required.

(1) Common Recreation Areas. Each multifamily building or complex of four or more units shall provide a minimum area of 200 square feet of common recreation space per dwelling unit, including those used by the owner or building management personnel. The common recreation area(s) shall be available to all residents of the building/complex. Not more than 50 percent of the required recreation area shall be indoors. Common recreation areas shall include fixtures and facilities, as approved by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director, that promote passive and/or active recreational activities.

(2) Private Recreation Areas. A minimum of 60 square feet of private outdoor recreation area shall be provided for each dwelling unit.

[Ord. 1591 § 347, 2014.]


18.155.060 Play space for preadolescent children.

At least 50 percent of the required common recreation area shall be designed and improved as play space for preadolescent children. For the purposes of this chapter, “play spaces for preadolescent children” mean environments designed to support and suggest activities that are an essential part of a child’s learning and development (social, emotional, cognitive, and physical). Each play space shall include at least two play equipment fixtures, and at least one adult seating area as approved by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director. Play equipment fixtures include, but are not limited to, sand boxes, slides, swing sets, cargo net play equipment, horizontal overhead ladders, and similar features. All play areas and equipment shall conform to the design, installation, and maintenance guidelines described in the King County Division of Parks and Recreation “Play Area Design and Inspection Handbook.” Planning, Building and Public Works Director may approve a reduction in the percentage of common recreation area that must be designed and improved as play space for children where the applicant can demonstrate to the Director’s satisfaction that few or no children will reside in the development. In considering approval of such reduction, the Director may consider items such as:

(1) Number of bedrooms per dwelling unit, and the total number of bedrooms proposed;

(2) Location of the development site; and

(3) Availability of nearby public play space for children. [Ord. 1591 § 348, 2014.]


18.155.070 General provisions.

(1) Where the required common area is less than 3,000 square feet, the common outdoor space shall be concentrated in one area. The common recreation area shall be at least 25 feet in width. Where the required common area is 3,000 square feet or more, the space may be divided among multiple areas; provided, that at least one recreation area is a minimum of 2,000 square feet in area with a minimum width of 25 feet. All other areas shall be at least 1,000 square feet in area with a minimum width of 10 feet.

(2) No part of a required recreation area may be used for driveways, parking, or other vehicular use. Adequate fence and plant screening, as approved by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director, shall separate outdoor recreation areas from vehicular areas.

(3) Required recreation areas may not be located in undevelopable buffer areas required in chapter 16.10 DMMC.

(4) The required front yard area shall not be counted toward satisfying the common recreation area requirement. The side and rear yard areas may be counted toward recreation area requirements if the design satisfies the purpose and intent of this chapter, without resulting in adverse impacts upon nearby properties. Active recreation areas are not permitted where the activity would adversely impact required on-site landscaping.

(5) Unless otherwise approved by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director, required play spaces for children shall be accessible from all on-site dwellings by pedestrian paths separate from vehicular areas.

(6) The provisions of DMMC 18.155.060 shall not apply to senior citizen housing developments, such as continuing care retirement communities, nursing homes, respite care facilities, and retirement housing developments, and other developments not required by law to accept children as residents.

(7) The required private and common recreation areas shall be designated on development plans reviewed by the Planning, Building and Public Works Department. The property owners and/or responsible parties shall maintain the required recreation areas for the life of the project.

(8) A subdivision or planned unit development containing several multifamily residential lots, and multifamily developments which are built in phases, shall provide on-site recreation facilities for each phase or shall provide the total amount of required recreation area in the first phase of construction. [Ord. 1591 § 349, 2014.]


18.155.080 In-lieu cash contribution.

Where the size of the development site is insufficient to provide a quality common recreation area, or the improvement of City park facilities in the vicinity will be of greater benefit to the residents of the proposed dwellings, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may allow the applicant to make a voluntary payment to the City in lieu of providing the required on-site common recreation facilities. Acceptance of such a voluntary contribution is discretionary on the part of the City. Such payments shall be placed in a neighborhood park fund to be used for capital improvements in existing parks, or for the development of new parks in the vicinity of the development site. The administration of in-lieu contributions, including any refund of the contribution, shall comply with the provisions of chapter 82.02 RCW as hereafter amended. The amount of payment shall be based upon the current assessed value (as determined by the County Assessor) of the entire development site. The amount of in-lieu contribution shall be as follows:

 

	Required common recreation area minus (-)

	provided common recreation area equals (=) X

	X/site area = Y

	Assessed value multiplied by Y = In-lieu contribution

18.160.010 Title.

This chapter shall be entitled “Adult Entertainment Facility Zoning.” [Ord. 1591 § 352, 2014.]


18.160.020 Findings of fact.

(1) The City Council is committed to protecting the general welfare of the City through the enforcement of laws prohibiting obscenity, indecency, and sexual offenses while preserving constitutionally protected forms of expression.

(2) The City has made a detailed review of the national record, including studies from the cities of New York, Indianapolis, and Los Angeles, the police records of various cities, and court decisions regarding adult entertainment uses, including adult retail establishments. The City Council finds that adult entertainment uses, including adult retail establishments, require special supervision from public safety agencies in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons and employees of said business as well as the citizens of the City.

(3) The City Council finds that concerns about crime and public sexual activity generated and/or occurring within or near adult entertainment and adult retail establishments are legitimate, substantial and compelling concerns of the City which demand reasonable regulation.

(4) The City Council finds that adult entertainment and adult retail establishments, due to their nature, have secondary adverse impacts upon the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry through increases in crime and opportunity for spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

(5) There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment and adult retail establishments have a detrimental effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime, the downgrading of quality of life and property values and the spread of urban blight. Reasonable regulation of the location of these facilities will provide for the protection of the community, protect residents, patrons, and employees from the adverse secondary effects of such facilities.

(6) The City recognizes that adult entertainment and adult retail establishments, due to their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods, day care centers, religious facilities, public parks, schools, and public facilities open to families, such as post offices and medical clinics, and thereby having a deleterious impact upon the quality of life in the surrounding areas. It has been acknowledged by courts and communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure the adverse secondary effects of the establishments are minimized.

(7) This chapter is intended to protect the general public health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry of the City through the regulation of the location of adult entertainment and adult retail establishments. The regulations set forth herein are intended to control health, safety, and welfare issues, the decline in neighborhood conditions in and around adult entertainment and adult retail establishments, and to isolate dangerous and unlawful conduct associated with these facilities.

(8) It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article 1, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution, but to enact content-neutral legislation which addresses the negative secondary impacts of adult entertainment and adult retail establishments.

(9) It is not the intent of the City Council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the City Council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials.

(10) The City Council, at its duly advertised public hearing on September 13, 2001, considered the subject matter of adult entertainment and adult retail establishments, at which public hearing the City Council received comments from the public on that subject matter, which the City Council believes to be true, and which, together with the findings heretofore set forth, form the basis for the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. [Ord. 1591 § 353, 2014.]


18.160.030 Adult entertainment facilities prohibited in certain areas.

Adult entertainment facilities, as defined in this Title, shall only be permitted within the PR-C Zone south of South 216th Street:

(1) So long as such uses are located within a building that fronts Pacific Highway South and obtains its access exclusively from such highway; and

(2) So long as such uses are located no less than 1,000 feet from the property lines of churches, common schools, day care centers, and public facilities, and 1,000 feet from any other adult entertainment or adult retail use. As used herein, the distances shall mean the straight-line distance between the edge or corner of the property on which the adult retail use is located to the nearest edge or corner of the property of the disqualifying site. [Ord. 1644 § 1, 2016: Ord. 1591 § 354, 2014.]


18.160.040 Amortization of any nonconforming use.

Any adult entertainment, activity, use, or retail use located within the City limits on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section that is made nonconforming by this chapter shall be terminated within one year; provided, however, that such termination date may be extended upon the approval of an application filed with the City within 120 days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section requesting an extension of such one-year amortization period. The decision on whether or not to approve any extension period and the length of such period shall be based upon the applicant clearly demonstrating extreme economic hardship based upon an irreversible financial investment or commitment made prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, which precludes reasonable alternative uses of the subject property. [Ord. 1591 § 355, 2014.]


18.160.050 Conflicts.

In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other provision of this code, this chapter applies and supersedes. [Ord. 1591 § 356, 2014.]

This chapter shall be entitled “Height, Yards, Area, and Open Spaces – General Provisions.” [Ord. 1591 § 381, 2014.]


18.190.020 Application.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all zones. [Ord. 1591 § 382, 2014.]


18.190.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for height, yards, area, and open spaces. [Ord. 1591 § 383, 2014.]


18.190.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1591 § 384, 2014.]


18.190.050 Regulations subject to chapter.

The foregoing regulations of this Title shall be subject to the general provisions, conditions, and exceptions contained in this chapter. [Ord. 1591 § 385, 2014.]


18.190.060 Height of buildings on through lots.

On through lots divided by a zone boundary line, the line shall be considered a property boundary line for purposes of determining the permitted height on the building site. [Ord. 1591 § 386, 2014.]


18.190.070 Height of structures and roof structures.

Penthouses or roof structures for the housing of elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, or similar equipment required to operate and maintain the building, fire walls, parapet walls and guards not taller than the minimum required for compliance with the Washington State Building Code, skylights, flagpoles, chimneys, smokestacks, church steeples and belfries, utility line towers and poles, and similar structures may be erected above the height limits of this Title; provided, however, no penthouse or roof structure or any other space above the height limit prescribed for the zone in which the building or structure is located shall be allowed for the purpose of providing additional floor space; provided further, that rooftop gardens and patios are not classified as additional floor space for the purpose of this section. [Ord. 1737 § 11, 2020; Ord. 1737 § 11, 2020; Ord. 1591 § 387, 2014.]


18.190.080 Construction on artificial grades.

The height of any structure constructed on an artificial grade shall be measured from existing grade, as defined in the International Building Code, in accordance with the formula contained in DMMC 18.01.050. The decision as to whether a grade is artificial shall be made by the Planning, Building and Public Works Department, subject to appeal to the Hearing Examiner in accordance with the Hearing Examiner code, and shall be based on the intent of the developer as professionally perceived by the Planning, Building and Public Works Department. No grade shall be deemed artificial if, in the professional opinion of the Planning, Building and Public Works Department, the change of grade is necessary for development of the property on the basis of sound engineering principles and customary construction practices in the area. [Ord. 1591 § 388, 2014.]


18.190.090 Yards and open spaces.

Except as may be otherwise provided in this Title, every required yard and open space shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky. No yard or open space provided around any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Title shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building, and no yard or open space on any lot or parcel shall be considered as providing a yard or open space on an adjoining lot or parcel whereon a building is to be erected. [Ord. 1591 § 389, 2014.]


18.190.100 Greater yard and open space requirements include minimum requirements.

Wherever in this Title a particular use, or a building in connection with a particular use, is specifically required to maintain a distance from any boundary property line or other building or buildings on the site greater than the minimum standard required yard or open space set forth for the zone, such greater distance is intended to apply only to the particular building, buildings, or use involved and the standard required minimum yards and open spaces required for the zone (if any) shall be included as a part of the greater required distance or open space for the specified building, buildings, or use. [Ord. 1591 § 390, 2014.]


18.190.110 Modification or adjustment of side yard requirements on consolidated lots or oversize building sites.

When the common property line separating two contiguous lots is covered by a building or permitted group of buildings, such lots shall constitute a single building site and the yard spaces required by this Title shall then not apply to such common property line. [Ord. 1591 § 391, 2014.]


18.190.120 Yard requirements when more than one main building exists.

Where two or more buildings are, by definition of this Title, considered to be main buildings, then the front yard requirements shall apply only to the building closest to the lot front line. [Ord. 1591 § 392, 2014.]


18.190.130 Method for determining modification of required front yard on steep lots.

On any lot where the natural gradient or slopes, as measured from the lot front line along the centerline for the lot for a distance of 60 feet is in excess of 35 percent, then the required front yard may be reduced one foot for each one percent of gradient or slope in excess of 35 percent. [Ord. 1591 § 393, 2014.]


18.190.140 Modification of required front yards where nonconformities exist.

(1) The depth of required front yards on unimproved lots may be modified when any of the following circumstances apply:

(a) When the unimproved lot or lots are located between lots having nonconforming front yards;

(b) When the unimproved lot or lots are located between a lot having a nonconforming front yard and a lot having a conforming front yard;

(c) When the unimproved lot or lots are located between a lot having a nonconforming front yard and a vacant corner lot; and

(d) Where a vacant corner lot or reverse corner lot adjoins a lot having a nonconforming front yard.

(2) A nonconforming front yard shall be deemed to be an area between the lot front line and the portion of the main building closest to it, which area is less in depth than that defined by this Title as constituting a required front yard. On a lot having a nonconforming front yard the degree of nonconformity to be credited in making the adjustment shall in no instance exceed 60 percent of the front yard depth required on the nonconforming lot, such percentage to be measured from the rear line of the required front yard on such lot toward the lot front line.

(3) The rear line of the modified front yard on the unimproved lot or lots as referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall be established in the following manner:

(a) On lots having nonconforming front yards a point shall be established at the intersection of the line determining the depth of the lot with a line coincident with the front of the building causing the nonconforming conditions;

(b) On lots having conforming front yards or on a vacant corner lot, a point shall be established at the intersection of the line determining the depth of the lot with the rear line of the required front yard;

(c) A straight line shall be drawn from such point of intersection on the lot with the nonconforming front yard across any intervening unimproved lot or lots to a point established on the next lot in either direction as set forth in subsections (3)(a) and (b) of this section; and

(d) The depth of the modified front yard on any lot traversed by the straight line defined in subsection (3)(c) of this section shall be established by the point where the straight line intersects the line constituting the depth of each such intervening lot.

(4) When an unimproved corner lot or reverse corner lot adjoins a lot having a nonconforming front yard, the front yard on the corner lot or reverse corner lot may be the same as that on the adjoining lot; provided, the placement of the buildings does not interfere with the required vision clearance at the corner formed by the intersection of the streets. [Ord. 1591 § 394, 2014.]


18.190.150 Yard requirements for property abutting half-streets or streets designated by official control.

(1) A building or structure shall not be erected on a lot which abuts a street having only a portion of its required width dedicated and where no part of such dedication would normally revert to the lot if the street were vacated, unless the yards provided and maintained in connection with such building or structure have a width or depth of that portion of the lot needed to complete the road width plus the width or depth of the yards required on the lot by this Title, if any. This section applies to all zones.

(2) Where an official control adopted pursuant to law includes plans for the widening of existing streets, the connecting of existing streets, or the establishment of new streets, the placement of buildings and the maintenance of yards, where required by this Title, shall be measured from the future street boundaries as determined by such official control. [Ord. 1591 § 395, 2014.]


18.190.160 Measurement of front yards.

Front yard requirements shall be measured from the property front line or the indicated edge of a street for which an official control exists, except as provided in DMMC 18.190.150. [Ord. 1591 § 396, 2014.]


18.190.170 Vision clearance – Corner and reverse corner lots.

All corner lots and reverse corner lots subject to yard requirements shall maintain for safety vision purposes a triangular area, one angle of which shall be formed by the lot front line and the side line separating the lot from the street, and the sides of the triangle forming the corner angle shall each be 15 feet in length measured from the aforementioned angle. The third side of the triangle shall be a straight line connecting the last two mentioned points which are distant 15 feet from the intersection of the lot front and side lines. Within the area comprising the triangle no tree, fence, shrub, or other physical obstruction higher than 42 inches above the established grade shall be permitted. [Ord. 1591 § 397, 2014.]


18.190.180 Permitted intrusions into required yards.

The following may project into required yards:

(1) Fireplace structures not wider than eight feet measured in the general direction of the wall of which it is a part – 18 inches into any yard;

(2) Uncovered porches and platforms which do not extend above the floor level of the first floor – 18 inches into side yards and six feet into the front yard; provided, they may extend three feet into the side yard when they do not exceed 18 inches in height above the finished grade; and

(3) Planting boxes or masonry planters not exceeding 42 inches in height in any required front yard. [Ord. 1591 § 398, 2014.]


18.190.190 Location of swimming pools.

In any zone, a swimming pool may not be located in any required front yard, nor closer than five feet to any property line or to any building on the same premises. [Ord. 1591 § 399, 2014.]


18.190.200 Location and height of wall, fence or hedge.

In any Residential Zone a wall, fence, or hedge is permitted under the following conditions:

(1) Where a fence is installed directly on the ground, the height of the fence shall be the vertical distance from the top board, rail, or wire to the ground directly below the fence; where a masonry or stone wall is used as a fence, the height shall be the vertical distance from the top surface of the wall to the ground on the high side of the wall;

(2) A wall, fence, or hedge not more than 42 inches in height may be permitted on any part of a lot that is not otherwise restricted;

(3) On all residential lots, either partially or fully view-obscuring walls, fences, or hedges not exceeding six feet in height shall be permitted on any lot line; except that any wall, fence, or hedge greater than 42 inches in height and located within the required front yard and side yard adjacent to a street shall be constructed of wrought iron, chain link, or similar materials that, as a whole, shall not be greater than 20 percent view obscuring or, if other materials are used that are greater than 20 percent view obscuring, the property owner shall first obtain approval from the City Traffic Engineer to ensure that safe sight distance is maintained and a traffic hazard shall not be created;

(4) Where a retaining wall protecting a cut below the natural grade is located on the line separating lots or parcels, such retaining wall may be topped by a fence, wall, or hedge of the same height that would otherwise be permitted at the location if no retaining wall existed, and the top of the retaining wall shall be considered the bottom of the fence;

(5) Where a retaining wall contains a fill, the height of the retaining wall built to retain the fill shall be considered as contributing to the permissible height of a wall, fence, or hedge, and shall be measured from the ground on the low side; provided, that in any event a protective fence not more than 42 inches in height may be erected at the top of the retaining wall and any portion of such fence above the six-foot maximum height shall be no greater than 50 percent view obscuring;

(6) Electric fences shall not be permitted in any Residential Zone except as allowed in DMMC 18.190.310(2);

(7) No fence shall be located in any public right-of-way, unless a right-of-way permit is obtained from the City;

(8) Any fence exceeding a height of six feet, and any retaining wall exceeding a height of 48 inches, shall require the property owner to obtain a building permit; the provisions and conditions of this section shall not apply to fences required by state law to surround and enclose public utility installations, or to chain link fences enclosing school grounds and public playgrounds;

(9) The height restrictions in this section may be modified by the Community Development Director in accordance with this section when the need for such modification results from governmental acquisition of property for right-of-way expansion or construction of essential public transportation facilities. [Ord. 1695 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 14, 2016: Ord. 1591 § 400, 2014.]


18.190.210 Required increase of side yard where multiple or row dwellings front upon a side yard.

The minimum width of the side yard upon which multiple or row dwellings front shall be not less than 10 feet. Open, unenclosed porches not extending above the floor level of the first floor may project a distance of not more than three feet into the side yard upon which such dwellings front. [Ord. 1591 § 401, 2014.]


18.190.220 Required increase of side yard where multiple or row dwellings rear upon a side yard.

Where multiple or row dwellings are arranged so that the rear of such dwellings abuts upon a side yard, and such dwellings have openings onto such side yard used as secondary means of access to such dwellings, the required side yard to the rear of such dwellings shall be increased by one foot for each opening onto such side yard. [Ord. 1591 § 402, 2014.]


18.190.230 Yard requirements on through lots.

(1) If a through lot is improved as one building site, the main building shall conform to the requirements of the zone of the frontage occupied by such main building, and in Residential Zones no accessory building shall be located closer to either street than the distance constituting the required front yard on such street, and required side yards shall extend the full depth of the lot except as provided in DMMC 18.55.090.

(2) If a through lot is divided by a zone boundary line, the line shall be considered a property boundary line for purposes of determining the required yards and open spaces. [Ord. 1655 § 15, 2016: Ord. 1591 § 403, 2014.]


18.190.240 Lot area not to be reduced.

The lot area of any lot recorded prior to August 3, 1964, shall not be so reduced or diminished that the area, width, yards, or other open spaces shall be less than prescribed by this Title for the zone in which the property is located, nor shall the number of dwelling units be increased in any manner except in conformity with the regulations established by this Title. In multiple lot subdivisions recorded subsequent to August 3, 1964, the minimum lot area requirement for each lot in the subdivision shall be deemed to have been conformed to if the average lot areas for all lots in the subdivision meet the minimum requirements set forth in the zone applying to the property. [Ord. 1591 § 404, 2014.]


18.190.250 Dividing an improved building site area prohibited.

When a single lot or parcel contains twice the minimum required lot area or more for the zone in which it is located, and the total area of the site has been used to compute the number of dwelling units to be located thereon, the building or buildings which contain dwelling units shall be so located on the property as to cover, at least in part, any line that would represent a property line between two or more parcels that could result from an otherwise legal division of the original lot or parcel, and thereafter no property shall be alienated from the building site which would reduce the total required area of the site upon which the number of dwelling units located thereon was based. [Ord. 1591 § 405, 2014.]


18.190.260 Greater yards and open spaces not to be alienated.

Where a greater height of buildings has been accomplished by reason of providing increased yards or open spaces, no property may be alienated from the lot or building site which would reduce the yards or open spaces provided to compensate for the greater height of the building, nor which would reduce the total required minimum area of the site upon which area the permitted floor space contained in such building was based. [Ord. 1591 § 406, 2014.]


18.190.270 Greater lot area may be required.

Greater lot areas than those prescribed in the various zones may be required when such greater areas are established by the adoption of a planned unit development as provided in this Title. [Ord. 1591 § 407, 2014.]


18.190.280 Substandard or nonconforming lots in Residential or Commercial Zones.

In any Residential or Commercial Zone, a dwelling or building may be established on a lot which cannot satisfy the lot area requirements of the zone; provided, that:

(1) All other bulk regulations shall apply; and

(2) The owner of such nonconforming lot does not own any adjoining vacant lots of record of continuous boundary to which the nonconforming or substandard lot can be merged in title or with which the lot lines can be adjusted to create lots of record which satisfy the lot area requirements of the zone or create a lot of record of greater area; and

(3) The owner of such nonconforming lot or lots has not received a fee interest in such lot or lots from a party who at any time subsequent to April 25, 1988, held a fee interest in any adjoining lot of continuous boundary; and further provided, that the limitation in this subsection shall not apply to a party who either (a) acquires a fee interest by enforcement of a security interest in such property where the security interest was created prior to April 25, 1988, or (b) has acquired such fee interest as the result of a judicial decree of partition by a court of competent jurisdiction; or

(4) The government has acquired a portion of the property for right-of-way expansion or construction of essential public transportation facilities, subject to subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section. [Ord. 1695 § 4, 2017: Ord. 1591 § 408, 2014.]


18.190.290 Substandard lots may be combined.

In an RA or Multifamily Residential Zone two or more substandard lots or fractions of lots, or a standard lot and substandard lot or fraction of lots, may be consolidated into a single building site; provided, the total area of such consolidated lots is less than twice the required minimum lot area of the zone in which the property is located. In an RA or Multifamily Residential Zone a single building, which complies with the requirements of the zone in which it is located, may be erected on such consolidated site containing as many dwelling units as would be permitted if each substandard lot or fraction of a lot were improved individually. No portion of the consolidated building site shall thereafter be alienated which would reduce the area upon which the number of dwelling units allowed thereon was based. [Ord. 1591 § 409, 2014.]


18.190.300 Use of lots or parcels containing more than minimum required lot area.

When a lot contains two or more times the minimum lot area required for the zone in which the lot is located, and the owner desires to use each unit of area equivalent to the minimum lot area as a separate building site; provided, not more than four such units result, and no dedication of streets, alleys, or other public ways are involved, such area units may be so utilized only after approval of the lot division as prescribed in the Subdivision Code (Title 17 DMMC). When such units are thus defined, then all of the provisions of this Title governing the use of a lot in the zone in which such property is located shall apply thereto. [Ord. 1591 § 410, 2014.] 


18.190.310 Dangerous fences – Restrictions.

Dangerous fences are subject to the following restrictions:

(1) Fences containing razor wire, coiled barbed wire, or material(s) of similar design are prohibited in all Residential Zones, except that the Planning, Building and Public Works Director may approve such dangerous fences in Residential Zones for jails, detention facilities and other methods of court-ordered personal confinement, through the building permit process. Only those fences to be used for the purposes set forth in this subsection will be allowed under such permit.

(2) Electric fences are not permitted in the City except when used to contain grazing animals in an area zoned to allow such a use. Electric fences must be set back at least five feet from the property line or must be enclosed by additional fencing or other barriers which prevent access to the electric fence by small children on the adjacent property.

(3) A barbed wire fence may be a maximum of five feet in height and may contain four strands of taut parallel barbed wire.

(4) A fence or wall may incorporate a maximum of three strands of parallel barbed wire a maximum of two feet in height on top of the fence, so long as the orientation is either straight up or angled in toward the site. If such a fence contains three strands of barbed wire which are oriented outward from the site, the fence shall be set back from the property line a distance of one to 10 feet as determined by the Planning, Building and Public Works Director, based on the following criteria:

(a) The proximity of the fence to existing or planned sidewalks, pedestrian ways, or public parking areas;

(b) Whether the security needs for the property can be satisfied;

(c) Whether the location of the fence will degrade the aesthetics of the surrounding area;

(d) Whether the fence location is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the general public;

(e) Whether either required landscaping can be fulfilled, or landscaping is otherwise provided to ameliorate visual impacts of the fence;

(f) The proximity of the fence to environmentally critical areas, open space, or other such areas likely to provide habitat for urban mammals.

(5) In Residential Zones, all permitted dangerous fences shall comply with height and setback restrictions for all fences as set forth in DMMC 18.190.200. For properties where both codes apply, the more restrictive code shall prevail.

(6) All fences not in compliance with this section shall, within 60 days of notification from the City, be removed by the owner or, upon failure to remove the fence, the Planning, Building and Public Works Director is empowered to cause the removal of the fence, the cost of which shall be billed to the owner.

18.195.010 Title.

This chapter shall be entitled “Landscaping and Screening.” [Ord. 1591 § 412, 2014.]


18.195.020 Application.

(1) General Applicability. Landscaping required pursuant to this chapter shall be installed throughout the entire building site in accordance with an approved site plan, prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy or business license for any of the following development activities:

(a) Construction of a new building or structure;

(b) Expansion of an existing building or structure where such expansion contains 20 percent or more of the floor area of the existing building or structure;

(c) Creation or expansion of a parking area or other paved surface; and

(d) Creation or expansion of an outdoor use, activity, or storage area.

(2) Exceptions. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply in the following circumstances:

(a) Single-family residential development activities shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter except as may be specifically required by any section.

(b) Where the Planning, Building and Public Works Department determines that existing structures are situated so as to preclude installation of required landscaping, such required landscaping shall be waived for the area affected by such structures.

(c) Where compliance with the provisions of chapter 18.210 DMMC, loading areas and off-street parking requirements for existing buildings or structures, conflicts with the requirements of this chapter, the required landscaping shall be waived, or modified in accordance with DMMC 18.195.420.

(d) The irrigation requirements of DMMC 18.195.080 shall apply only to construction of a new building or structure or expansion of an existing building or structure.

(3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve the applicant of open space, buffer, setback, and other such development constraints defined by the zoning code, conditional use permit concomitant rezone agreement, subdivision code, planned unit development, shorelines master program, and terms of approvals associated therewith.

(4) Plan Requirements. The Planning, Building and Public Works Department shall review and may approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove site landscape development plans for all development activities subject to the provisions of this chapter. A landscaping plan shall be submitted to the Planning, Building and Public Works Department accurately drawn using an appropriate engineering or architectural scale which shows the following:

(a) Boundaries and dimensions of the site;

(b) Location and identification of all streets, alleys, sidewalks, and easements abutting the site, including dimensions;

(c) Proposed topography at a maximum of five-foot contours;

(d) Proposed location and dimensions of all on-site buildings including height of structures and distance between buildings;

(e) Details of any proposed architectural barriers;

(f) Dimensions and location of storage and trash areas, loading docks, exterior utility installations, and mechanical equipment;

(g) Layout and dimensions of all parking stalls, easements, access ways, turnaround areas, driveways, and sidewalks on-site;

(h) Percentage of landscaping for total site and net square footage of parcel;

(i) Proposed landscaping including location, species, and size at time of planting;

(j) Existing vegetation in general, and identifying all evergreen trees six inches in diameter or greater as measured at 54 inches above the ground and all deciduous trees eight inches in diameter or greater as measured at 54 inches above the ground;

(k) Irrigation plan, indicating the location of pipes, sprinkler heads and pumps, pipe size, head capacity, water pressure in pounds per square inch at the pump and sprinkler heads, and timer system. [Ord. 1611 § 16, 2014; Ord. 1591 § 413, 2014.]


18.195.030 Purpose.

The purpose of the landscaping and screening requirements of this chapter are to increase compatibility between different intensities of land uses, by providing visual barriers, visually interrupting the barren expanse of paved parking lots, screening undesirable views which have a blighting impact on surrounding properties, and providing a visual separation and physical buffer between varying intensities of abutting land uses; to implement the Comprehensive Plan; to encourage the retention of significant existing vegetation to the extent feasible; to reduce erosion and water runoff; to conserve energy; to preserve and promote urban wildlife habitats; to minimize impacts of noise, light and glare; and to aid in regulating vehicular circulation. [Ord. 1591 § 414, 2014.]

Article IV. Specific Requirements


18.195.360 Landscaping of parking facilities.

Landscaping shall be provided within all surface (open air) parking lots, as follows:

(1) Design Criteria. Landscape areas shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the large expanses of pavement, divide and define driveways, parking stalls and corridors, limit cross-taxiing, delineate and separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and screen parking facilities from abutting properties. Planting areas and landscaping shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking lot with the interior dimensions of such areas being sufficient to protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to ensure proper growth. The primary landscaping materials used shall consist of canopy-type deciduous trees or spreading evergreen trees planted in wells or strips with a mixture of deciduous and evergreen shrubs and/or ground cover. Shrubbery, hedges, and other planting materials shall be used to complement the tree landscaping, but shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping. Existing vegetation, architectural barriers or berms may be incorporated into the landscape design; provided, they contribute to achieving the intent of this subsection.

(2) Interior Coverage Requirements. A minimum of five percent of a parking facility shall be landscaped. Landscaping which is required for screening along the perimeter of any lot and border plantings adjacent to buildings upon which a parking lot abuts shall not be considered as part of the interior coverage requirement. Parking spaces abutting a perimeter for which landscaping is required by other requirements of this code shall not be considered as a part of the interior of the parking facility.

(a) For off-street parking facilities providing 10 or fewer parking stalls, the interior coverage requirements stated in this section shall not apply.

(b) Any interior landscape area shall contain a minimum of 50 square feet, shall have a minimum dimension of five feet, and shall include at least one tree with the remaining area landscaped with shrubs, ground cover, or other approved landscaping materials not exceeding three feet in height.

(c) Trees shall number not less than one for each five parking stalls, to be reasonably distributed throughout the parking lot.

18.195.380 Type I – Solid screen.

Type I landscaping is intended to provide a solid sight barrier to a height of 10 feet totally separating incompatible land uses. Type I landscaping shall generally consist of a mix of predominantly evergreen plantings including living trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum height of six feet at time of planting. Plantings shall be chosen and spaced so as to grow together within two years sufficient to provide a 100 percent sight-obscuring screen. The entire planting strip shall be landscaped; however, those plantings used to achieve the sight-obscuring screen shall cover at least five feet of the width of the strip and shall be located farthest from the property line. Existing vegetation, architectural barriers (including walls, planters, and fences), or berms may be incorporated into the landscape design as set forth in DMMC 18.195.420, and shall be considered acceptable in lieu of new plantings; provided, they contribute to achieving the intent of this section. [Ord. 1591 § 449, 2014.]

Type II landscaping is intended to create a visual separation that is not necessarily 100 percent sight-obscuring. Type II landscaping shall consist of a mix of evergreen and deciduous plantings, trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Plantings of shrubs and ground covers shall be chosen and spaced to result in a total covering of the landscape strip. Shrubs shall be of a type that achieve a height of approximately six feet within two years, and effectively screen views along the length of the planting strip. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter two inches at time of planting; evergreen trees shall be a minimum six feet tall at time of planting. Trees shall be located farthest from the property line. All trees shall be spaced at intervals resulting in touching of branches after 10 years of normal growth. Existing vegetation, architectural barriers, or grading, which may be incorporated into the landscape design as set forth in DMMC 18.195.420, shall be considered acceptable in lieu of new plantings; provided, they contribute to achieving the intent of this section. [Ord. 1591 § 450, 2014.]


18.195.400 Type III – See-through buffer.

Type III landscaping is intended to provide visual separation of uses from streets and main arterials and between compatible uses so as to soften the appearance of streets, parking lots, and building facades. Type III landscaping shall consist of evergreen and deciduous trees planted not more than 30 feet on center interspersed with large and small shrubs and ground cover. Plantings of shrubs and ground covers shall be chosen and spaced to result in a covering of the landscape strip within two years.

(a) Whenever a building utilized for business or office purposes is proposed to be placed within 10 feet of the street right-of-way and there are no loading docks on such street, and at least 50 percent of the wall length is utilized for window and door construction, and the setback is utilized in effect as a sidewalk; provided, approved street trees are planted within the 10-foot setback no more than 30 feet on center;

(b) When architectural barriers or berms are incorporated into the design of the landscaping and contribute to the intent of the type of landscaping required and the minimum width of planting is not reduced by more than 50 percent;

(c) When application of requirements of this section for commercial properties would result in more than 15 percent of the site area being landscaped, in which instance the Planning, Building and Public Works Department may modify those requirements such that not more than 15 percent of the site must be landscaped; provided, however, that the landscaping and corresponding setbacks required are those most beneficial to the public;

(d) When the inclusion of significant existing vegetation located on the site would result in as good as or better satisfaction of the purposes of this chapter;

(e) When, in the case of required perimeter landscaping adjacent to street rights-of-way, the ultimate street improvements for that right-of-way have been installed or will be installed as a requirement of approval of the development, and the Planning, Building and Public Works Department determines that the proposed landscaping of that portion of the right-of-way between the property line and sidewalk is acceptable, the Planning, Building and Public Works Department may allow such landscaping in lieu of required landscaping within the development; provided, the type and area of planting is comparable to that normally required and adequate provisions are made for permanent maintenance;

(f) When conditions on or adjacent to the site, including differences in elevation, existing vegetation, location of existing structures or utilities, continuity of design concepts within a zone, or emergency vehicle access, would render application of requirements of this chapter ineffective or result in scenic view obstruction;

Any property owner or occupant erecting or maintaining signage not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, except portable signs which are regulated in subsection (2) of this section, shall be given written notice, by certified letter, specifying the violation and a direction to correct the violation or remove the sign within 30 days. Such notice shall be given to the holder of the sign permit or, if no permit exists, to the named owner of the land where the sign is erected. In the event the violation is not corrected within the 30-day period, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall thereupon revoke the permit and remove, or cause the removal of the sign, and shall assess all costs and expenses incurred against the named owner of the sign and/or named owner of the land. Any sign which is a source of immediate peril to persons or property may be removed summarily and without notice. Alternatively, this subsection may be enforced pursuant to chapter 18.01 DMMC.

(2) Portable Signage. Portable signage includes any sign not permanently affixed; real estate signs; political signs; portable reader board signs; streamers; pennants; banners; signs attached to or mounted on trees, fences, utility poles, or vehicles parked in proximity to a business with the purpose of attracting attention to such business; or any similar signs. Except as provided for in DMMC 18.200.070(12)(k), portable signs in violation of this chapter located in the right-of-way must be removed upon 24-hour notice. Such notice shall be given by delivering a written notice of violation to the owner, occupant, or person ostensibly in charge or control of the real property upon which the sign is located. Such notice shall state the violation and shall require that the violation be corrected within 24 hours. In the event the violation is not corrected within 24 hours, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall cause the sign or signs to be impounded. If the portable sign is located off-site of the premises to which the sign reasonably relates, or if ownership of the sign cannot be reasonably determined, no notice of violation shall be provided and the sign shall be impounded forthwith. In the event a sign is removed, there shall be a removal fee and a storage fee as set by administrative order of the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee. No sign shall be returned until the removal and storage fee is paid in full. The sign shall be stored for not less than 10 days, and thereafter the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall dispose of the sign in any manner. No cause of action shall be maintained against the City for damage to signs properly impounded, whether such damage occurred during the impoundment or storage. A second violation occurring within a 12-month period shall be considered a Class 1 civil infraction. A third violation occurring within a 12-month period shall result in a criminal prosecution and immediate impoundment of the sign without notice. This enforcement provision supersedes the processes contained in DMMC 18.01.090, and provides for immediate prosecution pursuant to DMMC 18.01.090. For such repeat offenses sign alteration or substitution shall be no defense. [Ord. 1591 § 492, 2014.]

18.205.050 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter clearly requires otherwise, the words or phrases defined in this section shall have the indicated meanings.

“Battery charging station” means an electrical component assembly or cluster of component assemblies designed specifically to charge batteries within electric vehicles, which meet or exceed any standards, codes, and regulations set forth by chapter 19.28 RCW and consistent with rules adopted under RCW 19.27.540.

“Battery exchange station” means a fully automated facility that will enable an electric vehicle with a swappable battery to enter a drive lane and exchange the depleted battery with a fully charged battery through a fully automated process, which meets or exceeds any standards, codes, and regulations set forth by chapter 19.27 RCW and consistent with rules adopted under RCW 19.27.540.

“Charging levels” means the standardized indicators of electrical force, or voltage, at which an electric vehicle’s battery is recharged. The terms Level 1, 2, and 3 are the most common EV charging levels, and include the following specifications:

(1) Level 1 is considered slow charging and operates on a 15 to 20 amp breaker on a 120 volt AC circuit.

(2) Level 2 is considered medium charging and operates on a 40 to 100 amp breaker on a 208 or 240 volt AC circuit.

(3) Level 3 is considered “fast” or “rapid” charging and typically operates on a 60 amp or higher breaker on a 480 volt or higher three phase circuit with special grounding equipment. Level 3 stations are primarily for commercial and public applications and are typically characterized by industrial grade electrical outlets that allow for faster recharging of electric vehicles.

“Electric vehicle” means any vehicle that operates, either partially or exclusively, on electrical energy from the grid, or an off-board source, that is stored on-board for motive purpose. “Electric vehicle” includes:

(1) A battery electric vehicle;

(2) A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle;

(3) A neighborhood electric vehicle; and

(4) A medium-speed electric vehicle.

“Electric vehicle charging station” means a public or private parking space that is served by battery charging station equipment for the purpose of transferring electric energy to a battery or other energy storage device in an electric vehicle.

“Electric vehicle infrastructure” means structures, machinery, and equipment necessary and integral to support an electric vehicle, including battery charging stations, rapid charging stations, and battery exchange stations.

“Electric vehicle parking space” means any parking space signed or marked exclusively for the parking of an electric vehicle at a battery charging station.

“Rapid charging station” means an industrial grade electrical outlet that allows for faster recharging of electric vehicle batteries through higher power levels and that meets or exceeds any standards, codes, and regulations set forth by chapter 19.28 RCW and consistent with rules adopted under RCW 19.27.540. [Ord. 1591 § 499, 2014.]

This chapter shall be applicable to all zones as set forth herein. [Ord. 1591 § 506, 2014.]


18.210.030 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to specify off-street parking and loading requirements, describing design standards and other required improvements, in order to provide for adequate, convenient, and safe off-street parking and loading areas for the different land uses described in this Title. [Ord. 1591 § 507, 2014.]


18.210.040 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW and other applicable laws. [Ord. 1591 § 508, 2014.]


18.210.050 Off-street parking and loading areas required.

Every parking space or facility and vehicle sales areas, trailer sales areas, and boat sales areas, shall be developed, improved, and maintained as provided within this chapter.

(1) Preexisting Parking Spaces. A development in existence prior to May 8, 1987, or at the time of its annexation to the City if later, which does not have sufficient parking space on the basis of this section, may continue to operate with the parking deficiency as long as no enlargement or other change is made which would require additional parking spaces.

(2) Off-street parking and loading areas shall be provided as an accessory use in accordance with the provisions of this chapter for every building hereafter erected, altered, enlarged, relocated, or at the time there is a change in its principal use.

(3) When there are alterations or additions to a nonresidential building or when an alteration or addition results in an increase in the number of dwelling units in a multifamily residential structure, off-street parking shall be provided for any increase in the number of dwelling units or increase in gross floor area in accordance with the requirements of DMMC 18.210.090; however, no parking spaces need be provided in the case of an enlargement or expansion where the number of parking spaces required for expansion or enlargement is less than 10 percent of the parking spaces specified for a similar structure. [Ord. 1591 § 509, 2014.]


18.210.060 General requirements.

(1) Off-Street Parking Development Permit Required. No off-street parking facility or spaces, nor enlargement thereof, shall be constructed without having first secured an off-street parking development permit from the code official; provided, that no such permit shall be required if a building permit is required. Such permit shall be authorized upon the approval of a parking plan as provided in subsection (2) of this section and adherence to the provisions of this chapter and shall be subject to such inspections deemed necessary by the code official to ensure compliance.

(2) Parking Plan Required. Prior to issuance of a building permit for any new building or structure or for the enlargement of the floor area of an existing building or structure, the use of which requires off-street parking facilities to be provided as set forth in this Title, and prior to issuance of an off-street parking development permit; a plan of the parking area accurately showing grades and other required design features, shall be approved by the code official.

(3) Compliance Required Prior to Certificate of Occupancy or Issuance of Business License. Parking facilities and traffic-control devices such as parking stripes designating car stalls, directional arrows, etc., as provided in this chapter, shall be installed and completed prior to issuance of an occupancy permit or business license.

(4) Parking Stall Use Restricted – Commercial Zones. Parking stalls shall be used for the temporary parking of motor vehicles only of patrons, personnel, residents, and the like. Parking stalls shall not be used for storage of motor vehicles or materials, signs, sales, repair work, or dismantling of motor vehicles, etc.

(5) Maintenance. Maintenance of all areas provided for off-street parking shall be required and shall include removal and replacement of dead and dying trees, grass, and shrubs, removal of trash and weeds, and repair of traffic-control devices, signs, light standards, fences, walls, surfacing materials, curbs, and railings. [Ord. 1591 § 510, 2014.]


18.210.070 Modification of parking provisions.

(1) Number of Spaces. The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may by formal action waive or modify the number of spaces required, establishing the amount of required parking for uses involving very limited number of employees or which do not require personnel and daily attendance or for which the number of parking spaces proposed is demonstrated sufficient to fully serve the use, is consistent with the intent of this chapter and when strict application of the code would result in unnecessary hardship. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Parking Generation Manual or an independent consultant study are examples that could be used to demonstrate sufficiency of proposed parking.

(2) Dimensions. In cases where the strict application of this Title would unreasonably limit full utilization of a site for parking, the code official may authorize a reduction of up to three percent of any minimum dimension required in this chapter, except where such reduction would substantially restrict ease of travel or maneuverability of vehicles using the parking facility.

(3) Marina District. The parking provisions for commercial uses established by DMMC 18.210.090 are waived; provided, that there is compliance with all the following standards:

(a) The property is zoned Downtown Commercial according to the official zoning map.

(b) Residential uses within a mixed use development are not included in this exemption. Residential uses in a mixed use building shall comply with the requirements established by DMMC 18.210.090.

(c) The property owner shall enter into a no protest agreement regarding the formation of a downtown business or parking improvement district.

(d) This provision is only valid until December 31, 2015.

(4) Interim Uses. The City Manager or City Manager’s designee may, by formal action, waive or modify other requirements of this chapter for uses not to exceed five years including but not limited to exceptions for nonconflicting time in use and design requirements in DMMC 18.210.220 through 18.210.240 for commercial developments, upon approval of a plan that is consistent with the intent of this chapter and when strict application of the code would result in unnecessary hardship. The site plan showing the location of the parking on the property and parking plan must include provisions for:

(a) Improved parking meeting all City design requirements meeting at least 50 percent of the required parking.

(b) User safety, including lighting and site security.

(c) The required number of ADA parking stalls per the International Building Code and required pedestrian access to and from the building for physically disabled as well as able bodied.

(d) Adequate site drainage.

(e) Safe vehicle access to and egress from the parking lot.

(f) A parking operations plan including:

(i) The hours of operations;

(iii) The name, address and phone number of the operator of the parking.

(5) Assurances and guarantees to suspend interim parking use at the end of the permitted period unless extended and restore the site.

The interim use may be extended an additional three years upon application. In approving the plan or the extension request, the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee may impose additional conditions including but not limited to a requirement for the applicant to post a performance bond or other security guaranteeing that it will cease the interim use at the end of approved period. [Ord. 1592 § 1, 2014; Ord. 1591 § 511, 2014.]


18.210.080 Parking spaces to serve one use, building, or complex – Exceptions.

(1) Off-street parking facilities approved in conjunction with one use, building, or complex of buildings shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use, except as hereinafter provided.

(2) Exception for Cooperative Use. Where adjoining parking facilities of two or more land uses can be joined or coordinated to achieve efficiency of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, provision of additional landscaping or usable public open space, economy of space, and a superior grouping of buildings or uses, a reduction of 20 percent of the total combined required parking may be permitted when consistent with the intent of this chapter. The common parking facilities for residential and nonresidential uses within a mixed use development may be included in the Pacific Ridge Zone established by chapter 18.135 DMMC. The residential allowance shall not apply to residential land uses within other Commercial Zones of the City. Where cooperative use is permitted, assignment of parking spaces to individual uses or buildings shall be prohibited.

(3) Exception for Nonconflicting Time in Use. A reduction of up to 50 percent of required parking stalls, except for residential, may be authorized under the following conditions, as long as the total reduction doesn’t fall below the levels for residential uses:

(4) Exemptions granted under the above provisions shall be made after filing with the City a record of covenant or other contract between the cooperating property owners approved by the City Attorney. Joint-use privilege shall continue in effect only so long as such agreement, binding on all parties, remains in force. If such agreement becomes legally ineffective due to changed circumstances including but not limited to a change in the type or nature of business activities, then parking shall be provided as otherwise required by this chapter.

(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent cooperative provision of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses when the total off-street parking is not less than the sum of the required parking facilities for the various uses computed separately.

The privilege of cross-examination of witnesses shall be accorded all interested parties or their counsel in accordance with rules of the Examiner. [Ord. 1591 § 592, 2014.]


18.240.140 Jurisdiction and powers.

The Hearing Examiner exercises all powers and authority, as a first level forum in quasi-adjudicatory matters, formerly exercised by the City Council and Board of Adjustment subject to the provisions of chapter 35.14 RCW. [Ord. 1591 § 593, 2014.]


18.240.150 Duty to conduct hearings – Decisions to be in writing – Time period.

The Examiner shall receive and examine available information, conduct public hearings and prepare a record thereof, and enter final decisions, which have the effect of an administrative decision appealable to the City Council. Each decision of a Hearing Examiner shall be in writing and shall include findings and conclusions, based on the record, to support the decision. In land use matters, such findings and conclusions shall also set forth the manner in which the decision would carry out and conform to the City’s Comprehensive Plan and the City’s development regulations. Each final decision of a Hearing Examiner shall be rendered within 14 working days following conclusion of all testimony and hearings, unless a longer period is mutually agreed to in writing by the applicant and Hearing Examiner. [Ord. 1591 § 594, 2014.]


18.240.160 Matters to be heard by Examiner.

Specifically, the Hearing Examiner conducts public hearings (where applicable) and renders final decisions on the following:

(1) Type III land use actions as specified by chapter 18.20 DMMC, Land Use Review Procedures;

(2) Appeals of administrative decisions as further provided in this code; and

(3) Such other matters as the City Council may from time to time refer. [Ord. 1591 § 595, 2014.]


18.240.170 Appeal from administrative decisions – Time for filing – Substantial weight requirement – Standard of review – Failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

Any person or persons aggrieved by any administrative decision, made under a provision of this code which expressly provides that such administrative decision is subject to review by the Hearing Examiner, may seek review of such decision by the Hearing Examiner by filing with the City Clerk a written notice of appeal of an administrative decision within 10 days of the decision that is being challenged. The City Clerk may reject or dismiss any appeal sought to be filed by a person not given the right to appeal under this code, or any incomplete appeal. An appeal will be considered incomplete if it fails to satisfy the requirements set forth above or if it does not provide at least the following:

(1) Applicable filing fee, a schedule of which is available by contacting the City Clerk;

(2) The appellant’s name, address, telephone number and fax line, and other information which would facilitate prompt communications with the appellant;

(3) A copy of the administrative decision that is the subject of the appeal;

(4) A detailed statement identifying specifically the error of fact, law or procedure made by the administrative decision maker, and the effect(s) of the alleged error(s) on the decision that is the subject of the appeal; and

(5) A statement of the redress sought by the appellant.

The administrative decision appealed shall be given substantial weight by the Hearing Examiner. On any such appeal, the standard of review shall be whether the administrative decision was clearly erroneous based on a review of all evidence, or the administrative decision was arbitrary or capricious. Failure of a party to request review by the Hearing Examiner of an administrative decision shall be a bar to any further judicial review. [Ord. 1591 § 596, 2014.]


18.240.180 Decisions – Basis – Conditional.

In land use matters, the Examiner’s decision shall be based on the policies of the Comprehensive Plan, Shoreline Master Program, Shoreline Management Act, State Environmental Policy Act, the standards set forth in the various land use regulatory codes of the City, or other applicable programs adopted by the City Council. If the Hearing Examiner finds, in reaching his decision based on the above policies and standards, that the land use regulatory code conflicts with any of the local policies or standards, then the Hearing Examiner will base his decision on the code provision in effect at the time and notify the City Council by memorandum directed through the Planning, Building and Public Works Department setting forth the nature of the conflict between policies and regulatory code. The Hearing Examiner may include in a decision any conditions of approval that are necessary to ensure that the proposal (a) complies with all applicable zoning code criteria and Comprehensive Plan policies, including the Shoreline Management Act and State Environmental Policy Act, and (b) does not present probable significant adverse environmental impacts to surrounding properties or any other affected area. The Hearing Examiner may revoke an approved permit for failure to comply with any such conditions. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Exact location and nature of development, including additional building and parking area setbacks, screenings in the form of landscaped berms, landscaping, or fencing;

(2) Impact of the development upon other lands;

(3) Hours of use of operation or type and intensity of activities;

(4) Sequence and scheduling of development;

(5) Maintenance of the development;

(6) Duration of use and subsequent removal of structures;

(7) Granting of easements for utilities or other purposes and dedication of land or other provisions for public facilities, the need for which the Examiner finds would be generated in whole or in significant part by the proposed development;

(8) Mitigation of any significant adverse environmental impacts including off-site improvements reasonably related to the project;

(9) Provisions which would bring the proposal into compliance with the Comprehensive Plan policy; and

(10) Posting of performance bonds as required to ensure compliance with any conditions, modifications, and/or restrictions imposed on the proposal. [Ord. 1591 § 597, 2014.]


18.240.190 Dismissal of pending matters.

Any franchise granted pursuant to chapter 20.04 DMMC shall be nonexclusive and shall not preclude the city from granting other or further franchises or permits or preclude the city from using any public rights-of-way, streets, or other public properties or affect its jurisdiction over them or any part of them, or limit the full power of the city to make such changes, as the city shall deem necessary, including the dedication, establishment, maintenance, and improvement of all new public rights-of-way and other public properties.

(2) Incorporation by Reference. The provisions of this title shall be incorporated by reference in any franchise ordinance approved hereunder. The provisions of any proposal submitted and accepted by the city shall be incorporated by reference in the applicable franchise.

(3) Nature and Extent of the Franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder by the city shall authorize a franchisee, subject to the provisions herein contained, to:

(a) Engage in the business of operating and providing cable services or other video services and the distribution and sale of such services to subscribers within the city;

(b) Erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along any street such amplifiers and appliances, lines, cables, conductors, vaults, manholes, pedestals, attachments, supporting structures, and other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the cable television system or other video system, and provide similar cable facilities, or properties rented or leased from other persons, firms or corporations, including but not limited to any public utility or other franchisee franchised or permitted to do business in the city. No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred upon a franchisee by any franchise except those specifically prescribed therein, and any use of any street shall be consistent with any prior lawful occupancy of the street or any subsequent improvement or installation therein.

(4) Length of the Franchise. The city shall have the right to grant franchises for a period of time appropriate to the circumstances of the particular grant. [Ord. 1316 § 43(1), 2003.]

(b) Whether the applicant has the requisite financial and technical resources and capabilities to build, operate and maintain a cable television system or other video system in the area;

(c) Whether the applicant has no conflicting interests, either financial or commercial, which will be contrary to the interests of the city;

(e) Whether the applicant is capable of complying with all relevant federal, state, and local regulations, codes and standards pertaining to the construction, operation and maintenance of the cable television system or other video system facilities incorporated in its application for a franchise;

(f) Whether the public rights-of-way have the capacity to accommodate the cable television system or other video system;

(g) Whether the proposed franchise is consistent with the city’s present and future use of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable television system or other video system;

(h) Whether the benefit to the public from the cable television system or other video system outweighs the potential disruption to existing users of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable television system or other video system, and the resultant inconvenience which may occur to the public;

(i) Whether all other conditions resulting from the grant of the franchise have been considered by the city and that the city determines that the grant is still in the public’s best interest;

(j) Whether the quality of the franchisee’s previous service in other communities has been reasonable in light of community needs;

(k) Whether the franchisee’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.

(d) Whether the franchisee has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in a franchisee’s proposal.

Additionally, the city council expressly reserves unto itself all its police powers to adopt additional ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public in relation to the rights granted under a franchise. The city reserves the right to use, occupy and enjoy any public rights-of-way or other public places for any purpose, including without limitation the construction of any water, sewer or storm drainage system, installation of traffic signals, street lights, trees, landscaping, bicycle paths and lanes, equestrian trails, sidewalks, other pedestrian amenities, other city services, or uses not limited to the enumerated items as listed herein, and other public street improvement projects.

If the city believes it must release any such confidential books and records in the course of enforcing a franchise or this title, or for any other reason, it shall advise a franchisee in advance so that a franchisee may take appropriate steps to protect its interests.

In this regard a franchisee shall act, so far as it is within its control, to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted service during the term of the franchise.

In the event a franchisee fails to operate a cable television system or other video system for 72 continuous and consecutive hours without prior notification to and approval of the city council or without just cause such as an impossibility to operate the cable television system or other video system because of the occurrence of an emergency or other circumstances reasonably beyond a franchisee’s control, the city may, after notice and an opportunity for a franchisee to commence operations at its option, operate the cable television system or other video system or designate someone to operate the cable television system or other video system until such time as a franchisee restores cable service or other video service or a replacement franchisee is selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for a franchisee, a franchisee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs in excess of revenues from the cable television system received by the city that are the result of a franchisee’s failure to perform. [Ord. 1316 § 43(23), 2003.]


20.05.240 Franchise nontransferable.

(1) Franchisee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise and/or cable television system or any of the rights or privileges granted by the franchise, without the prior consent of the city council which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and shall be denied only upon a good faith finding by the city that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to perform its obligations under the franchise agreement or such other ground as may be permitted. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise and/or cable television system without the consent of the council shall by federal law result in an immediate termination of the franchise. This provision shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. No consent from the city shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with franchisee.

(2) The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of the franchise and/or cable television system requiring compliance with this section:

(a) The sale, assignment or other transfer of 50 percent or more of franchisee’s assets;

(b) The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interests in franchisee by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in franchisee;

(c) The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interest by franchisee so as to create a new controlling interest in franchisee; and

(d) The entry by the franchisee into an agreement with respect to the management or operation of the franchisee and/or the cable television system. The term “controlling interest” as used herein means majority equity ownership of the franchisee.

(3) Except as provided below, no franchisee may sell or otherwise transfer ownership in a franchise and/or cable television system within a 36-month period following either the acquisition or initial construction of said cable television system by franchisee. In the case of a sale of multiple cable television systems, if the terms of the sale require the buyer to subsequently transfer ownership of one or more such cable television systems to one or more third parties, such transfer shall be considered a part of the initial transaction. The above-described 36-month holding period shall not apply to:

(a) Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise and/or cable television system which is not subject to federal income tax liability;

(b) Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency, any state or political subdivision or the city; or

(c) Any sale, assignment, or transfer, to one or more purchasers, assignees, or transferees controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, the seller, assignor, or transferor.

(4) In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any franchise and/or cable television system after the 36-month period following acquisition of such cable television system, and in accordance with federal law, the city shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with Federal Communications Commission regulations, the requirements of this title or a franchise, and such other reasonable information as the city, in its sole discretion, may request. If the city fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days from receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of time.

(5) Franchisee shall notify city in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the franchisee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be considered by city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of city to such change in control of ownership shall apply.

(6) For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and franchisee shall assist city in any such inquiry. In seeking city’s consent to any change of ownership or control, franchisee shall have the responsibility of insuring that the transferee completes an application in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to city, which application shall include the information required under state and federal law. An application, acceptable to the city, shall be submitted to city no more than 120 days nor less than 90 days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and maintain the cable television system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If, after considering the legal, financial, character and technical qualities of the applicant and determining that they are satisfactory, the city finds that such transfer is acceptable, the city shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise. The consent of the city to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied.

(7) Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchisee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it or its designee satisfactory to the city shall take control of and operate the cable television system, in the event of a franchisee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation within 30 days of assuming such control that will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the cable television system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the cable television system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the city in its discretion and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another franchisee.

(8) The city shall be reimbursed for its out-of-pocket costs associated with its review of a franchisee’s request. Such costs will not exceed in constant dollars those incurred during the original franchising or refranchising process.

(a) A cable system or other video system shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, leased, or disposed of, either in whole or in part, either by involuntary sale or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest, or property therein pass to or vest in any person or entity, without the prior written consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(b) A franchisee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of a franchisee. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to majority stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise on the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of a majority of the shares or the general partnership interest in the franchisee. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of a franchisee shall make a franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto.

(c) The parties to the sale or transfer shall make a written request to the city for its approval of a sale or transfer and furnish all information required by law and the franchise.

(d) The city shall render a final written decision on the request within 120 days of the request, provided it has received all requested information. Subject to the foregoing, if the city fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of time.

(e) Within 30 days of any transfer or sale, if approved or deemed granted by the city, a franchisee shall file with the city a copy of a written instrument evidencing such sale or transfer of ownership or control, certified and sworn to as correct by a franchisee and the transferee.

(f) In reviewing a request for sale or transfer, the city may inquire into the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the prospective controlling party or transferee, and the franchisee shall assist the city in so inquiring.

(g) The consent or approval of the city to any transfer by a franchisee shall not constitute a waiver or release of any rights of the city, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, the prior approval of the city shall not be required for any sale, assignment or transfer of the franchise and cable television system or other video system to an entity controlling, controlled by or under the same common control as a franchisee; provided, that the proposed assignee or transferee must show financial responsibility as may be determined necessary by the city and must agree in writing to comply with all provisions of the franchise. [Ord. 1316 § 43(24), 2003.]


20.05.250 Equalization of civic contributions.

In the event of one or more franchises being granted, the city may require that such subsequent franchisees pay to the city an amount proportionally equal to costs contributed by the original franchisee. These costs may include but are not limited to such features as access and institutional network costs, bidirectional or equivalent cable installed to municipal buildings and similar expenses.

On the anniversary of the grant of each later awarded franchise, such subsequent franchisees shall pay to the city an amount proportional to the amount contributed by the original franchisee, based upon the number of subscribers held by such subsequent franchisees. Such payments will be based upon incremental increases in subscribers, if any.

Additional franchisees shall provide all PEG access channel(s) currently available to the subscribers of existing franchisees. In order to provide these access channels, additional franchisees shall interconnect, at their cost, with existing franchisees, subject to any reasonable terms and conditions that the existing franchisee providing the interconnection may require. These interconnection agreements shall be made directly between the franchisees. The city council, in such cases of dispute of award, may be called upon to arbitrate regarding these arrangements. Any cost associated with the process shall be equally distributed by both franchisees. [Ord. 1316 § 43(25), 2003.]


20.05.260 Inconsistency.

If any portion of this title should be inconsistent or conflict with any rule or regulation now or hereafter adopted by the FCC or other federal or state law, then to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict, the rule or regulation of the FCC or other federal law shall control for so long, but only for so long, as such rule, regulation, or law shall remain in effect, provided the remaining provisions of this title shall not be affected thereby. [Ord. 1316 § 43(26), 2003.]


20.05.270 Severability.

If any section, sentence, paragraph, term, subsection, clause or phrase of this title should be held to be illegal, invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, or by any state or federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof, such illegality, invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the legality, validity or constitutionality of any other section, sentence, clause or phrase of this title. [Ord. 1316 § 43(27), 2003.]


20.05.280 Effect of change in law.

In the event that state or federal laws, rules or regulations preempt a provision or limit the enforceability of a provision of this title, then the provision shall be read to be preempted to the extent and for the time, but only to the extent and for the time, required by law. In the event such state or federal law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended, voided or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof that had been preempted is no longer preempted, such provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on the parties hereto, without the requirement of further action on the part of either party. [Ord. 1316 § 43(28), 2003.]

(2) If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete restoration required hereunder, the grantee shall temporarily restore the affected ways or property. Such temporary restoration shall be at the grantee’s sole expense and the grantee shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such permanent restoration.

(3) A grantee or other person acting on its behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares and other measures as required for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent injury or damage to any person, vehicle or property by reason of such work in or affecting such public way.

20.06.190 Security fund.

Each grantee shall establish a permanent security fund with the city by depositing the amount of up to $50,000 with the city in cash, an unconditional letter of credit, or other instrument acceptable to the city, which fund shall be maintained at the sole expense of grantee so long as any of grantee’s telecommunications facilities are located within the public ways.

(1) Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum efficiency in telephone service.

(2) Availability of road access.

(3) Availability of electric power.

(4) Availability of land-based telephone lines or microwave link capability.

(5) Lands leasable at fair market value, and landlords who want facilities to be located on their properties consistent with zoning regulations.

(6) Screening potential of existing vegetation, structures and topographic features.

(7) Zoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities.

(8) Compatibility with adjacent land uses.

(9) The least number of sites to cover the desired area.

(10) The greatest amount of coverage, consistent with physical requirements.

(11) Opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact.

(12) Availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 76, 2003.]


20.07.040 Site selection criteria.

(1) Any applicant proposing to construct an antenna support structure or mount an antenna on an existing structure outside of the public rights-of-way or any facility in the public rights-of-way other than small cell facilities shall demonstrate by engineering evidence that the antenna must be located at the site to satisfy its function in the applicant’s local grid system. Further, the applicant must demonstrate by engineering evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the site’s function within the grid system.

(2) Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates either that it is an FCC-licensed telecommunications provider or that it has agreements with an FCC-licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure.

(3) Low power mobile radio service facilities shall be located and designed to minimize and mitigate any significant adverse impact on residential property values. Facilities shall be placed in locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings, or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening.

(4) In all zones, location and design of facilities shall consider the impact of the facility on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district. In all zones, towers shall be significantly screened or designed according to standards to be established by the City Manager. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 77, 2003.]


20.07.050 Priority of locations.

The order of priorities for locating new personal wireless service facilities other than small cell facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be as follows:

(1) Place antennas and towers on City property if practical.

(2) Place antennas on existing structures, such as buildings, towers, water towers and smokestacks.

(3) Place antennas and towers in districts zoned commercial.

(4) Place antennas and towers on other nonresidential property.

(5) Place antennas on multifamily residential structures exceeding 30 feet in height.

(6) Place antennas and towers in Residential Zones (a) only if appropriate locations are not available in nonresidential zones, or (b) when collocation on an existing structure can be accomplished in a manner consistent with the design and aesthetic considerations provided under this Title. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 78, 2003.]


20.07.060 Conditional use permit required for antennas and personal wireless facilities in a Residential Zone.

(1) Except for items exempt from the provisions of this Title as provided in DMMC 20.07.020, a conditional use permit is required for all antennas, towers, and personal wireless facilities located in a Residential Zone, other than small cell facilities in the public rights-of-way. Small cell facilities within the public rights-of-way shall be located pursuant to Article II of this chapter. Any terms and conditions imposed on such use shall contain substantially similar terms and conditions which, taken as a whole and considering relevant characteristics of the facility and situation at hand, do not provide more or less favorable terms and conditions than those required of licensees or franchisees under this Title.

(2) An applicant that wishes to locate a new antenna support structure in a Residential Zone shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a government facility, a private institutional structure, or other appropriate existing structures within a nonresidential zone, and that due to valid considerations including physical constraints, and economic or technological feasibility, no appropriate location is available.

(3) Applicants are required to demonstrate that they: (a) have contacted the owners of structures in excess of 30 feet within a one-quarter-mile radius of the site proposed and which from a location standpoint could provide part of a network for transmission of signals, and (b) have asked for permission to install the antenna on those structures at fair market value.

(4) The information submitted by the applicant shall include: (a) a map of the area to be served by the tower or antenna, (b) its relationship to other cell sites in the applicant’s network, and (c) an evaluation of existing buildings taller than 30 feet within one-quarter mile of the proposed tower or antenna which from a location standpoint could provide part of a network to provide transmission of signals.

(5) In order to process eligible facility requests collocations and other applications subject to federal and state time limitations, the conditional use process may be expedited to the extent required to comply with chapter 35.99 RCW.

(6) Waiver of Conditional Use Permit. See DMMC 20.07.080 for waiver of conditional use permit for collocations and eligible facilities requests. A conditional use permit is not required for the location of wireless communication facilities on public property pursuant to DMMC 20.07.070. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 79, 2003.]

(xvii) At the time of site selection, the applicant should demonstrate how the proposed site fits into its overall network within the City. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 80, 2003.]


20.07.080 Collocation and eligible facilities requests.

(1) To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers, collocation of personal wireless service facilities and eligible facilities requests to expand facilities on existing or new towers are as follows:

(a) Proposed facilities may, and are encouraged to, collocate onto existing towers. Such collocation is permitted by right and new or additional conditional use permit approval is not required, except that any other permit, license, lease, or franchise requirements must be satisfied, and the collocation must be accomplished in a manner consistent with the policy, site criteria, and landscape/screening provisions contained in this Title.

(b) The conditional use permit requirement for a facility may be waived in all zones if the applicant locates the antenna on an existing structure or an existing tower or expands an existing facility by an eligible facilities request. The applicant must submit detailed plans to the Community Development Department for a collocation permit to determine if the conditional use permit process and public hearing can be waived. No building permit will be issued until approval is granted by a collocation permit or conditional use permit.

(c) The City may deny an application to construct new facilities if the applicant has not shown by substantial evidence that it has made a diligent effort to mount the facilities on an existing structure or tower or expand an existing facility by an eligible facilities request.

(d) To reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the City in the future, new proposed support structures shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical or physical reasons.

(e) Unless collocation is not feasible, an applicant’s site plan shall reserve an area for other providers’ equipment and/or probable expansion or modification of the applicant’s proposed facility near the base of the applicant’s tower. A first right-of-refusal (which is either executed or maintained while the provider’s personal wireless facilities and services are in use) to lease the area at the base of the tower or mount for other providers will meet the reservation requirement.

(f) To provide further incentive for collocation or expansion by an eligible facilities request, an existing tower may be modified through a collocation or eligible facilities request permit which may be issued by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee. See DMMC 20.10.020 et seq.

(g) While collocation and the requirements herein are encouraged, collocation shall not take precedence over the construction of shorter towers with appropriate screening.

(2) Providers with existing facilities capable of accommodating collocation within the City of Des Moines are hereby required to negotiate in good faith with any applicant seeking to collocate telecommunications equipment on their facilities.

If an applicant is unable to reach a collocation agreement with a provider owning or controlling an existing facility within the City as the result of terms and conditions which are believed to be in bad faith and anticompetitive, the aggrieved applicant may, upon payment of a filing fee to be established by the City Manager, petition the City Manager to make a determination as to whether such terms and conditions should be deemed in bad faith and anticompetitive. If the City Attorney concludes that the challenged terms and conditions of any collocation agreement are in bad faith and anticompetitive, the City Attorney may institute proceedings before the Hearing Examiner seeking revocation of any or all land use or other authorizations granted by the City with respect to the existence or operation of such facility; however, the City may, at its sole discretion, withdraw or refrain from initiating a revocation proceeding until such time as the aggrieved applicant makes payment or reaches and complies with an agreement with the City setting a schedule for payment of all reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred by the City in a revocation proceeding before the Hearing Examiner.

Upon receipt of a revocation recommendation from the City Attorney, the Hearing Examiner shall conduct all necessary proceedings and reach a determination as to whether the terms and conditions of the challenged collocation agreement are in bad faith and anti-competitive. The Hearing Examiner shall have authority to revoke any and all land use permits or other authorizations granted by the City with respect to the existence and operation of telecommunications facilities owned or controlled by any provider found to be in violation of this section or impose lesser sanctions as provided in DMMC 20.06.280. Upon a determination by the Hearing Examiner to revoke permits or authorizations enabling the existence or operation of any facility(ies) or improvement(s) located within the City, the affected provider shall remove such facility(ies) in the time and manner provided in DMMC 20.06.290.

Notwithstanding provisions found elsewhere in City codes, appeals of any Hearing Examiner decision including decisions to site wireless communication facilities to be located outside of the public rights-of-way by conditional use permit issued under this section shall be before the King County Superior Court, and must be filed and served within 21 days of the issuance of such decision as provided in RCW 36.70C.040(3). Administrative permits issued pursuant to DMMC 20.07.070 or 20.07.240 are not land use decisions and are not subject to review under chapter 36.70C RCW. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 81, 2003.]


20.07.090 Design criteria.

(1) As provided above, new facilities shall be designed to accommodate collocation, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical, or physical reasons.

(2) Facilities shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses in the zoning district and screened or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site.

(a) Setback. A tower’s setback shall be measured from the base of the tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. In residential districts and residential land use areas, where permitted, towers shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to 100 percent of tower height as measured from ground level, except for unusual geographic limitations or other public policy considerations, as determined in the City’s sole discretion. All other towers shall comply with the minimum setback requirements of the area in which they are located in all other zoning districts, unless there are unusual geographical limitations or other public policy considerations as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the City.

Such considerations shall include, by way of illustration and not limitation, but are not limited to:

(i) Impact on adjacent properties;

(ii) Alternative sites for personal wireless facilities; and

(iii) The extent to which screening and camouflaging will mitigate the effects of the personal wireless facilities.

(b) View Corridors. Due consideration shall be given so that placement of towers, antennas, and personal wireless service facilities does not obstruct or significantly diminish views of Mt. Rainier, Puget Sound or the Olympic Mountains.

(c) Color, Marking, Lights, Signals and Signs. Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility unless a different color is required by the FCC or FAA.

No signals, lights, or signs shall be permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or the FAA. Should marking be required, in cases where there are residents located within a distance which is 300 percent of the height of the tower, then dual mode lighting shall be requested from the FAA and the residents located within said distance shall be notified.

(d) Equipment and Structures. Ground level equipment, buildings, and the tower base shall be screened from public view. The standards for the equipment buildings are as follows:

(i) The maximum floor area is 300 square feet and the maximum height is limited to the height of a one-story building which design is consistent with the neighborhood. Except in unusual circumstances or for other public policy considerations the equipment building may be located no more than 50 feet from the tower or antenna, with any additional distance to be left to the discretion of the City Manager. Depending upon the aesthetics and other related issues, the City, in its sole discretion, may approve multiple equipment structures or one or more larger structures.

(ii) Ground level buildings shall be screened from view by landscape plantings, fencing, or other appropriate means to satisfy City standards for Type I landscaping.

(iii) Equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar to the exterior building walls. Equipment for roof-mounted antenna may also be located within the building on which the antenna is mounted.

(iv) In instances where equipment buildings are located in Residential Zones, equipment buildings shall comply with setback requirements and shall be designed so as to conform in appearance with nearby residential structures.

(v) Equipment buildings, antennas, and related equipment shall occupy no more than 25 percent of the total roof area of the building the facility is mounted on, which may vary in the City’s sole discretion if collocation and an adequate screening structure are used.

(vi) Noise from antenna equipment should be reduced where possible to 30 Db. Continual low frequency sounds such as hums, clicks, buzzes and the like should be avoided.

The use must be approved on a site plan or final development plan, as applicable.

(e) Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If those standards and regulations are changed, then personal wireless service providers governed by this Title shall bring their towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within three months of their effective date or the timelines provided by the revised standards and regulations, whichever time period is longer. The revised standards and regulations are not retroactively applicable to existing providers, unless otherwise provided or permitted by federal law. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the City to remove a provider’s facilities at the provider’s expense.

(f) Building Codes – Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable City building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association (“EIA”), as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring its tower into compliance within 30 days, the City may remove the tower at the owner’s expense.

(g) Structural Design. Towers shall be constructed to the EIA Standards, which may be amended from time to time, and to all applicable construction/building codes. Further, any improvements or additions to existing towers shall require submission of site plans stamped by a professional engineer which demonstrate compliance with the EIA Standards and all other good industry practices. The plans shall be submitted and reviewed at the time building permits are requested.

(h) Fencing. A well-constructed wall or wooden fence not less than six feet in height from the finished grade shall be provided around each personal wireless service facility. Fencing should be colored or should be of a design which blends into the character of the existing environment. Access to the facility shall be through a locked gate. The use of chain link, plastic, vinyl, or wire fencing is prohibited unless it is fully screened from public view through the use of either climbing evergreen shrubs on the fence or evergreen shrubs equal to the height of the fence and consistent with the City’s Type I landscaping standards.

(i) Tower and Antenna Height.

(i) All applicants for approvals and/or permits required by the City for towers or antennas must demonstrate through engineering evidence that the height of the proposed tower and/or antenna is the minimum height necessary to satisfactorily fulfill the facility’s intended function.

(ii) No tower or antenna that is taller than the minimum height required, based on engineering evidence, shall be approved or otherwise permitted. Engineering evidence reviewed and considered by the City may include information obtained through the third-party review process set forth in DMMC 20.07.290.

(iii) No tower or mount shall exceed 80 feet; provided, that:

(A) A conditional use permit may be issued by the Hearing Examiner to allow a tower or mount up to but not exceeding 120 feet if the applicant can show by clear and convincing evidence that the additional height is necessary to allow for collocation of one or more additional facilities on the proposed tower; and

(B) The applicant presents a binding agreement with another provider ready, willing and able to collocate its facility on the proposed tower at or within a reasonable time of its completion, but not more than 90 days following completion, except for conditions or circumstances outside the control of the parties wishing to effectuate the collocation agreement related to the tower at issue; or the applicant presents a construction plan calling for collocation of more than one facility belonging to the applicant on the proposed tower at or within a reasonable time of its completion, but not more than 90 days following completion, except for conditions or circumstances outside the control of the applicant; and

(C) In the event that collocation of an additional facility has not occurred on any tower granted approval for a height exceeding 80 feet within the time period set forth above, the City may order removal or modification of the facility at the owner’s expense as provided in this Title; and

(4) In the event that landscaping and/or screening is not maintained at the required level, the City, after giving 30 days’ advance written notice, may maintain or establish the landscaping and/or screening. All expenses incurred by the City under this section shall constitute a civil debt owing to the City jointly and severally by the owner(s) and lessee(s), which debt shall be collectible in the same manner as any other civil debt. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 85, 2003.]

Article II. Small Cell Deployment – Franchise and Small Cell Permits


20.07.130 Overview of Article II.

In order to manage its right-of-way in a thoughtful manner which balances the need to accommodate new and evolving technologies with the preservation of the natural and aesthetic environment while complying with the requirements of state and federal law, the City of Des Moines adopts this process for the deployment of small cell and microcell technology. Service providers who seek to utilize the public right-of-way for small cell deployment in order to enhance wireless communication, data transmission or other related services to the citizens of the City must have a valid franchise agreement to provide the specific service which utilizes the right-of-way and a small cell permit to deploy the technology. Entities with franchises who wish to utilize a small cell deployment to upgrade or expand their existing services shall utilize the processes set forth in this Title and implementing small cell permits to deploy their technology and obtain design approval of specific installations. The small cell permit process administers deployment under a valid franchise. An entity without a franchise agreement may apply concurrently for a franchise and adjunct small cell permit which shall be processed concurrently as one master permit within the meaning of RCW 35.99.010(3) and 35.99.030. For entities with a valid franchise, see DMMC 20.07.170.

(1) Nothing in this chapter revises or diminishes the rights and obligations of an existing franchise.

(2) The term “small cell deployment” shall include the deployment of small cell facilities, microcells and small cell networks as those terms are defined by RCW 80.36.375; provided, that microcells may not be deployed in the public right-of-way, except as provided in Article I of this chapter.

(3) See chapter 20.01 DMMC for additional definitions. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.140 Application.

Applicants shall apply using the City’s franchise application form and submit a fee deposit commensurate with the estimated administrative costs of processing an application for a franchise. The City Manager or his or her designee (“City Manager”) is charged with administration of small cell deployments and other wireless communication review processes established under this chapter. Service providers seeking to utilize the City’s right-of-way for small cell deployments shall specify geographic boundaries for the small cell deployment described in the application. The applicant may designate the entire City at its discretion or any portion thereof as the franchise boundary. Phased development is permitted, and an applicant is encouraged to specify at least the initial small cell deployment in its application.

The following information shall be provided by all applicants for franchises seeking to utilize small cell deployment. Existing franchisees who seek to utilize a small cell deployment to expand or implement an existing franchise shall provide the information as a part of a small cell permit application for small cell deployment.

(1) Designation of Facilities. The application shall provide specific locational information including GIS coordinates of all facilities to the extent known and specify whether and where small cell facilities are to be located on existing utility poles including City-owned light standards (included in the definition of utility pole), or will utilize replacement utility poles, new poles, towers, and/or other structures. Conduit and/or ground-mounted equipment necessary for and intended for use in the deployment shall also be specified, to the extent known, regardless of whether the additional facilities are to be constructed by the applicant or leased from an infrastructure provider. Detailed schematics and visual renderings of the facilities shall be provided by the applicant. Failure to provide sufficient detail may result in a later finding of a significant change in the facility if significant elements of the facility were not shown on the originally approved franchise exhibit. Failure to include significant elements may also result in the requirement that new or undocumented elements complete the approval processes detailed in this chapter.

(2) Implementation. Absent specific approval of sites and facilities in a franchise, the rights granted under the franchise are implemented through the issuance of a small cell permit. The franchise application may be accompanied by one or more applications for a small cell permit to deploy small cells. An initial franchise including specific sites and facilities and/or a related small cell permit application(s) shall be processed concurrently as one master permit.

(a) Up to 15 sites may be specified in one small cell permit application for processing. The City Manager may allow up to five additional sites in the same application in order to consider small cell sites within one logical service area in one application.

(b) Issuance of a small cell permit to install a small cell deployment shall be contingent upon approval of a franchise or the possession of a valid franchise.

(c) If more than one application for a small cell permit is submitted by an applicant, they shall be considered in the order received. If multiple applications are submitted on the same date, the applicant shall indicate which application should be considered first. All small cell permits which are submitted in conjunction with a franchise application shall be considered as one master permit. Any element of a deployment which qualifies as either an eligible facilities request or a collocation pursuant to chapter 20.10 DMMC shall be specifically designated by the applicant and may be addressed separately by the City Manager in order to comply with the shot clocks established by federal law.

(d) The City Manager may approve, deny or conditionally approve all or any portion of the sites and/or facilities proposed in the small cell permit application.

(e) Any application for a franchise or small cell permit which contains an element which is not exempt from SEPA review shall comply with chapter 16.05 DMMC.

(f) Radio Frequency (“RF”) Certification. The applicant shall submit a sworn affidavit signed by an RF engineer with knowledge of the proposed project affirming that the small cell deployment will be compliant with all FCC and other governmental regulations in connection with human exposure to radio frequency emissions for every frequency at which the small cell facility and associated wireless backhaul will operate. An existing franchisee applying for a small cell permit for small cell deployment shall provide an RF certification for all facilities included in the deployment which are to be installed by the franchisee. If facilities necessary to the small cell deployment are to be provided by another franchisee, the right-of-way use permit and franchise to deploy such facilities shall be contingent on submittal of an RF certification by the other franchisee for any such facilities which produce RF emissions. If such facilities will emit RF emissions, this additional RF certification shall address the cumulative impact of the RF emissions and certify compliance with federal requirements. The initial franchisee and all implementing right-of-way use permits shall be contingent on such secondary certification. The applicant or franchisee shall immediately remove or repair any facilities that exceed FCC RF emission requirements. A modification of a facility by an eligible facilities request requires a new RF certification.

(g) Regulatory Authorization. Issuance of the use permit for the facilities shall also be contingent upon the applicant’s provision of proof of FCC and other regulatory approvals required to provide the service(s) or utilize the technologies sought to be installed.

(h) Completeness – Franchise and Small Cell Applications. The City Manager or his/her designee shall review an application for completeness and notify the applicant within 30 days of submission whether the application is complete; provided, however, that an applicant may consent to a different completeness review period. A service provider may resubmit an incomplete application within 60 days of notice by the City Manager. Failure to resubmit an application in a timely manner shall be deemed a withdrawal of that application. An applicant shall be notified in writing of the approval or denial of the application. No application shall be deemed complete without the fee deposit set by the City Manager. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.150 Review process.

The following provisions relate to applications for a franchise or small cell permit for small cell deployments:

(1) Review of Facilities. Review of the site locations proposed by the applicant shall be governed by the provisions of 47 USC 253 and 47 USC 332 and applicable case law. Applicants for franchises and the small cell permits which implement the franchise shall be treated in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner with other service providers utilizing supporting infrastructure which is functionally equivalent, that is, service providers whose facilities are similarly situated in terms of structure, placement or cumulative impacts. Franchise and small cell permit review under this chapter shall neither prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting the ability of an applicant to provide telecommunications services.

(2) Concealment. In any zone not designated by DMMC 20.07.260 for design review (“design review”), applications for a small cell permit or for facilities designated within a franchise, the City may permit small cell deployment on existing utility poles and replacement poles in accordance with the City’s generally applicable pole design and concealment standards adopted in Article III of this chapter and DMMC 20.07.240. Accordingly, small cell facilities installed pursuant to this concealment authorization may only be expanded pursuant to an eligible facilities request if the City Manager determines that such expansion would not defeat the concealment elements of the facilities.

(3) Design Review. Small cell deployment in Design Zones and underground districts, as well as certain new or replacement facilities, is subject to design review. See DMMC 20.07.260. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.160 Public comment.

The City shall provide notice of a complete application for a franchise on the City’s website with a link to the franchise application. This notice requirement shall also apply to existing franchisees applying for a small cell permit for small cell deployment. The notice shall include an email contact and telephone number for the applicant to answer citizen inquiries. The applicant is encouraged to host informational meetings for the public regarding the deployment. These meetings are for the public’s information and are neither hearings nor part of any land use or appeal process. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.170 Facilities designated in the franchise and/or small cell permit application.

Small cell deployments may be approved by reference to exhibits in an approved franchise. Approval of the franchise shall be deemed to approve the site and the design of small cell facilities set forth in the franchise. This approval is limited to the specific location, facility and design elements shown on the exhibits to the franchise. Any element not shown on an exhibit must be approved by the governing review processes designated herein. All facilities shall comply with the concealment standards adopted by the City in DMMC 20.07.150(2) and/or 20.07.240. An existing franchisee may, at its option:

(1) Apply to amend the existing franchise to designate additional sites for small cell deployment, as well as approve the small cell facilities to be installed and the concealment measures to be utilized; or

(2) Apply for a small cell permit which may include:

(a) Small cell facilities to be installed on existing utility poles and which utilize the generally applicable design and concealment standards established by DMMC 20.07.240; and/or

(b) Small cell facilities for placement on new utility poles or installations in a Design Zone or undergrounded areas, utilizing the design approval procedures set forth in DMMC 20.07.240(6). [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.180 Small cell permit and minor deviations.

(1) The City Manager shall review applications for small cell permits for small cell deployments approved by a franchise or described in a concurrent franchise application. The City Manager may authorize minor deviations in the small cell permit from the dimensional design and concealment technologies referenced in the exhibits to the franchise or design standards.

(2) A deviation in height of the pole of up to 10 feet above the height of the existing pole or a height providing the minimum clearance necessary to provide safety clearance may be permitted. Replacement poles of up to 10 feet above the height of the existing pole or minimum required safety clearance may also be permitted when required for clearance or separation by the pole owner or applicable electrical code.

(3) Deviations in the dimensions or volume of small cell facilities which do not exceed the cumulative total provided by the definition of a small cell or microcell facility in RCW 80.36.375 may be considered a minor deviation when an applicant replaces components of an existing, approved small cell facility. Provided, however, that in each instance the new or revised facilities shall not defeat the concealment features set by the City’s generally applicable pole design standard adopted pursuant to the franchise, DMMC 20.07.240.

(4) The decision of the City Manager to approve a small cell permit with a minor deviation, if any, shall be final and is not subject to appeal under City code or through further legislative review. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.190 Significant deviations.

Any request for significant deviations from the approved small cell facilities design designated in the franchise, small cell permit or City’s design and concealment standards shall be considered by the City Manager under the procedures applicable to a Type I land use action (see chapter 18.20 DMMC), and pursuant to the timelines established in chapter 20.10 DMMC. An applicant seeking approval of a new pole in a Design Zone or underground district designated by DMMC 20.07.260 shall be subject to the same review process. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.200 Wireless communication and small cell deployment facility approvals and processes.

(1) Small Cell Facilities Attached to Nonwooden Poles. Small cell facilities attached to existing or replacement nonwooden light poles and other nonwooden poles in the right-of-way or poles outside of the right-of-way shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) Antennas and the associated equipment enclosures shall be sited and installed in a manner which minimizes the visual impact on the streetscape either by fully concealing the antennas and associated equipment fully within the pole or through a concealment element plan which provides an equivalent or greater impact reduction. This requirement shall be applied in a manner which does not dictate the technology employed by the service provider nor unreasonably impair the technological performance of the equipment chosen by the service provider.

(b) All conduit, cables, wires and fiber must be routed internally in the light pole. Full concealment of all conduit, cables, wires and fiber is required within mounting brackets, shrouds, canisters or sleeves if attaching to exterior antennas or equipment.

(c) An antenna on top of an existing pole may not extend more than six feet above the height of the existing pole and the diameter may not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, unless the applicant can demonstrate that more space is needed. The antennas shall be integrated into the pole design so that they appear as a continuation of the original pole, including colored or painted to match the pole, and shall be shrouded or screened to blend with the pole except for canister antennas which shall not require screening. All cabling and mounting hardware/brackets from the bottom of the antenna to the top of the pole shall be fully concealed and integrated with the pole.

(d) Any replacement pole shall substantially conform to the design of the pole it is replacing or the neighboring pole design standards utilized within the contiguous right-of-way.

(e) The height of any replacement pole may not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the existing pole or the minimum additional height necessary for adequate clearance from electrical wires, whichever is greater.

(f) The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the City’s setback and sidewalk clearance requirements, ADA requirements, and if a replacement light standard then with the City’s lighting requirements.

(g) The use of the pole for the siting of a small cell facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small cell facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small cell facility and the small cell facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

(2) Wooden Pole Design Standards. Small cell facilities located on wooden poles shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) The wooden pole at the proposed location may be replaced with a taller pole for the purpose of accommodating a small cell facility; provided, that the replacement pole shall not exceed a height that is a maximum of 10 feet taller than the existing pole, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height extension is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities.

(b) A pole extender may be used instead of replacing an existing pole but may not increase the height of the existing pole by more than 10 feet unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and such height increase is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities. A “pole extender” as used herein is an object affixed between the pole and the antenna for the purpose of increasing the height of the antenna above the pole. The pole extender shall be painted to approximately match the color of the pole and shall substantially match the diameter of the pole measured at the top of the pole.

(c) Replacement wooden poles may either match the approximate color and materials of the replaced pole or shall be the standard new wooden pole used by the pole owner in the City.

(d) Antennas, equipment enclosures, and all ancillary equipment, boxes and conduit shall be colored or painted to match the approximate color of the surface of the wooden pole on which they are attached.

(e) Panel antennas shall not be mounted more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole.

(f) Antennas should be placed in an effort to minimize visual clutter and obtrusiveness. Multiple antennas are permitted on a wooden pole; provided, that each antenna enclosure shall not be more than three cubic feet in volume, with a cumulative total antenna volume not to exceed nine cubic feet, unless additional volume is technically necessary which in such cases the total volume may not exceed 12 cubic feet.

(g) A canister antenna may be mounted on top of an existing wooden pole, which may not exceed the height requirements described in subsection (2)(a) of this section. A canister antenna mounted on the top of a wooden pole shall not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, and shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The canister antenna must be placed to look as if it is an extension of the pole. In the alternative, the applicant may propose a side-mounted canister antenna, so long as the inside edge of the antenna is no more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole. All cables shall be concealed either within the canister antenna or within a sleeve between the antenna and the wooden pole.

(h) An omni-directional antenna may be mounted on the top of an existing wooden pole, provided such antenna is no more than four feet in height and is mounted directly on the top of a pole or attached to a sleeve made to look like the exterior of the pole as close to the top of the pole as technically feasible. All cables shall be concealed within the sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket.

(i) All related equipment including but not limited to ancillary equipment, radios, cables, associated shrouding, microwaves, and conduit which are mounted on wooden poles shall not be mounted more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is technically required, and is confirmed in writing by the pole owner.

(j) Equipment for small cell facilities must be attached to the wooden pole, unless otherwise permitted to be ground-mounted pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section. The equipment must be placed in the smallest enclosure possible for the intended purpose. The equipment enclosure may not exceed 17 cubic feet. Multiple equipment enclosures may be acceptable if designed to more closely integrate with the pole design and do not cumulatively exceed 17 cubic feet. The applicant is encouraged to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole if such banners or road signs are allowed by the pole owner.

(k) An applicant who desires to enclose its antennas and equipment within a unified enclosure may do so; provided, that such unified enclosure does not exceed four cubic feet. To the extent possible the unified enclosure shall be placed so as to appear as an integrated part of the pole or behind banners or signs. The unified enclosure may not be placed more than six inches from the surface of the pole unless a further distance is technically required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner.

(l) The visual effect of the small cell facility on all other aspects of the appearance of the wooden pole shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible.

(m) The use of the wooden pole for the siting of a small cell facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small cell facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small cell facility and the small cell facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

(n) All cables and wires shall be routed through conduit along the outside of the pole. The outside conduit shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The number of conduits shall be minimized to the number technically necessary to accommodate the small cell.

(3) Small Cell Facilities Attached to Existing Buildings. Small cell facilities attached to existing buildings shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) Small cell facilities may be mounted to the sides of a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building’s architectural theme.

(b) The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is discouraged.

(c) New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if they complement the architecture of the existing building.

(d) Small cells shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building.

(e) Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed cabling/wiring is prohibited.

(f) Small cell facilities shall be painted and textured to match the adjacent building surfaces.

(4) Small cell facilities mounted on cables strung between existing utility poles shall conform to the following standards:

(a) Each strand-mounted facility shall not exceed three cubic feet in volume;

(b) Only one strand-mounted facility is permitted per cable between any two existing poles;

(c) The strand-mounted devices shall be placed as close as possible to the nearest utility pole, in no event more than six feet from the pole unless a greater distance is technically necessary or required by the pole owner for safety clearance;

(d) No strand-mounted device shall be located in or above the portion of the roadway open to vehicular traffic;

(e) Ground-mounted equipment to accommodate such strand-mounted facilities is not permitted, except when placed in preexisting equipment cabinets;

(f) Pole-mounted equipment for strand-mounted facilities shall meet the requirements for pole-mounted small cells; and

(g) Such strand-mounted devices must be installed to cause the least visual impact and with the minimum exterior cabling or wires (other than the original strand) necessary to meet the technological needs of the facility.

(5) General Requirements.

(a) Ground-mounted equipment in the rights-of-way is prohibited unless such facilities are placed underground or the applicant can demonstrate that pole-mounted or undergrounded equipment is technically infeasible. If ground-mounted equipment is necessary, then the applicant shall submit a concealment element plan. Generators located in the rights-of-way are prohibited.

(b) No equipment shall be operated so as to produce noise in violation of chapter 18.185 DMMC.

(c) Small cell facilities are not permitted on traffic signal poles.

(d) Replacement poles and new poles shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), City construction and sidewalk clearance standards, and state and federal regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the rights-of-way.

(e) Replacement poles shall be located as near as possible to the existing pole with the requirement to remove the abandoned pole.

(f) The design criteria as applicable to small cell facilities described herein shall be considered concealment elements and such small cell facilities may only be expanded upon an eligible facilities request described in chapter 20.10 DMMC, when the modification does not defeat the concealment elements of the facility.

(g) No signage, message or identification other than the manufacturer’s identification or identification required by governing law is allowed to be portrayed on any antenna, and any such signage on equipment enclosures shall be of the minimum amount possible to achieve the intended purpose; provided, that signs are permitted as concealment element techniques where appropriate.

(h) Antennas and related equipment shall not be illuminated except for security reasons, required by a federal or state authority, or unless approved as part of a concealment element plan.

(i) Side arm mounts for antennas or equipment are prohibited.

(j) The preferred location of a small cell facility on a pole is the location with the least visible impact.

(k) Antennas, equipment enclosures and ancillary equipment, conduit and cable shall not dominate the building or pole upon which they are attached.

(l) The City may consider the cumulative visual effects of small cells mounted on poles within the rights-of-way when assessing proposed siting locations so as to not adversely affect the visual character of the City. This provision shall not be applied to limit the number of permits issued when no alternative sites are reasonably available nor to impose a technological requirement on the service provider.

(m) These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape.

(6) New Poles in the Rights-of-Way for Small Cell Facilities and Installations in a Design District.

(a) New poles within the rights-of-way are only permitted if the applicant can establish that:

(i) The proposed small cell facility cannot be located on an existing utility pole or light pole, electrical transmission tower or on a site outside of the public rights-of-way such as a public park, public property, building, transmission tower or in or on a nonresidential use in a Residential Zone whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure;

(ii) The proposed wireless communications facility receives approval for a concealment element design, as described in subsection (6)(b) of this section;

(iii) The proposed wireless communications facility also complies with the Shoreline Master Program and SEPA, if applicable; and

(iv) No new poles shall be located in a critical area or associated buffer required by the City’s critical areas management ordinance, except when determined to be exempt pursuant to said ordinance.

(b) The concealment element design shall include the design of the screening, fencing or other concealment technology for a tower, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the proposed wireless communications facility, including but not limited to fiber and power connections.

(i) The concealment element design should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of wireless communications facility installations. The proposed pole or structure should have similar designs to existing neighboring poles in the rights-of-way, including to the extent technically feasible similar height. Other concealment methods include, but are not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color and texture – or the appearance thereof – as the surface against which the installation will be seen or on which it will be installed, landscape design, or other camouflage strategies appropriate for the type of installation. Applicants are required to utilize designs in which all conduit and wirelines are installed internally in the structure or otherwise integrated into the design of the structure. Use of a unified enclosure equal to or less than four cubic feet in volume may be permitted in meeting these criteria.

(ii) If the City Manager has already approved a concealment element design either for the applicant or another wireless communications facility along the same public right-of-way or for the same pole type, then the applicant shall utilize a substantially similar concealment element design, unless it can show that such concealment element design is not physically or technologically feasible, or that such deployment would undermine the generally applicable design standards.

(c) Even if an alternative location is established pursuant to subsection (6)(a)(i) of this section the conditional use permit process may determine that a new pole in the right-of-way is in fact a superior alternative based on the impact to the City, the concealment element design, the City’s Comprehensive Plan and the added benefits to the community.

(d) Prior to the issuance of a permit to construct a new pole or ground-mounted equipment in the right-of-way, the applicant must obtain a site-specific agreement from the City to locate such new pole or ground-mounted equipment. This requirement also applies to replacement poles that are higher than the replaced pole, and the overall height of the replacement pole and the proposed wireless communications facility is more than 60 feet.

(e) Installation of small cell facilities in a Design Zone (DMMC 20.07.260) shall be permitted by an administrative approval of a concealment plan utilizing the design and concealment standards contained in this chapter.

(f) These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.260 Designated Design Zones.

The following zones are designated as Design Zones for the purpose of the application of the provisions of this chapter:

(1) Pacific Ridge Commercial (PR-C);

(2) Pacific Ridge Residential (PR-R); and

(3) Marina District Planning Area.

The concealment element design developed pursuant to DMMC 20.07.240(6) shall utilize the Design Guidelines adopted for the design districts by Ordinance Nos. 1486 and 1268, respectively. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]


20.07.270 Review of wireless communications facilities other than small cell deployments.

Other wireless communication facilities shall be reviewed pursuant to this chapter, including wireless communication facilities outside of the public rights-of-way and all wireless communication facilities other than small cells when located in the public right-of-way.

(1) These provisions shall be interpreted and applied in order to comply with the provisions of federal law. By way of illustration and not limitation, any small cell facility which has been certified as compliant with all FCC and other government regulations regarding the human exposure to radio frequency emissions will not be denied on the basis of RF radiation concerns. See DMMC 20.07.140(2)(f).

(2) Wireless communication facilities shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter to the extent that such requirements (a) do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services, and (b) do not have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services within the City. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018.]

Article IV. Generally Applicable Requirements


20.07.280 Nonuse/abandonment.

(1) Abandonment. No less than 30 days prior to the date that a personal wireless service provider plans to abandon or discontinue operation of a facility, the provider must notify the City of Des Moines by certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operation. In the event that a licensed carrier fails to give notice, the facility shall be considered abandoned upon the City’s discovery of discontinuation of operation. Upon such abandonment, the provider shall have 60 days or additional period of time determined in the reasonable discretion of the City within which to:

(a) Reactivate the use of the facility or transfer the facility to another provider who makes actual use of the facility; or

(b) In the event that abandonment as defined in this Title occurs due to relocation of an antenna at a lower point on the antenna support structure, reduction in the effective radiated power of the antenna or reduction in the number of transmissions from the antennas, the operator of the tower shall have six months from the date of effective abandonment to collocate another service on the tower. If another service provider is not added to the tower, then the operator shall promptly dismantle and remove that portion of the tower which exceeds the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes which are made to personal wireless facilities which do not diminish their essential role in providing a total system shall not constitute abandonment. However, in the event that there is a physical reduction in height of substantially all of the provider towers in the City or surrounding area then all of the towers within the City shall similarly be reduced in height.

(2) Dismantle and Removal Facility. If the tower, antenna, foundation, base station, replacement pole and/or other facility is not removed within the 60-day time period or additional period of time allowed by the City, the City may remove such tower, antenna, foundation, base station, replacement pole and/or other facility at the provider’s expense. If there are two or more providers collocating on a facility, except as provided for in subsection (1)(b) of this section, this provision shall not become effective until all providers cease using the facility.

At the earlier of 60 days from the date of abandonment without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and removal, City approval for the facility shall automatically expire. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 86, 2003. Formerly 20.07.130.]


20.07.290 Third-party review.

Personal wireless service providers use various methodologies and analyses, including geographically based computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of their services and low power mobile radio service facilities, such as expected coverage area, antenna configuration, topographic constraints that affect signal paths, etc. In certain instances, a third-party expert may need to review the technical data submitted by a provider. The City may require a technical review as part of a permitting process. The costs of the technical review shall be borne by the provider.

The selection of the third-party expert may be by mutual agreement between the provider and the City, or at the discretion of the City, with a provision for the provider and interested parties to comment on the proposed expert and review his or her qualifications. The expert review is intended to address interference and public safety issues and be a site-specific review of technical aspects of the facilities or a review of the providers’ methodology and equipment used and not a subjective review of the site which was selected by a provider. Based on the results of the expert review, the City may require changes to the provider’s application. The expert review shall address the following:

(1) The accuracy and completeness of submissions;

(2) The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;

(3) The validity of conclusions reached; and

(4) Any specific technical issues designated by the City. [Ord. 1699 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 1316 § 87, 2003. Formerly 20.07.140.]

Upon completion of any construction work, the permittee shall promptly repair, but in no event longer than such time as may be established by the city during permit review, any and all public and private property, improvements, fixtures, structures and facilities which are damaged during the course of construction, restoring the same to their condition before construction commenced. [Ord. 1316 § 102, 2003.]


20.08.160 Landscape restoration.

(1) All trees, landscaping and grounds removed, damaged or disturbed as a result of the construction, installation, maintenance, operation, repair or replacement of telecommunications facilities, which is done pursuant to a franchise, license or permit, shall be replaced or restored to the condition existing prior to performance of the work.

(2) All restoration work within the public ways shall be done in accordance with landscape plans approved by the city. [Ord. 1316 § 103, 2003.]


20.08.170 Location of facilities.

Unless otherwise required in current or future city ordinances regarding underground construction requirements, all facilities shall be constructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

(1) Telecommunications facilities shall be installed within an existing underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such utility facility.

(2) A franchisee with written authorization to install overhead facilities shall install its telecommunications facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles only, and then only if surplus space is available.

(3) Whenever all existing telephone, electric utilities, cable facilities or telecommunications facilities are located underground within public ways, a franchisee with written authorization to occupy the same public ways must also locate its telecommunications facilities underground.

(4) Whenever all new or existing telephone, electric utilities, cable facilities or telecommunications facilities are located or relocated underground within public ways, a franchisee that currently occupies the same public ways shall concurrently relocate its facilities underground at its expense. [Ord. 1316 § 104, 2003.]


20.08.180 Conduit occupancy.

In furtherance of the public purpose of reduction of public way excavation, it is the goal of the city to encourage both the shared occupancy of underground conduit as well as the construction, whenever possible, of excess conduit capacity for occupancy of future right-of-way occupants. Therefore, if a franchisee is constructing underground conduit for its own telecommunications facility, and the city reasonably determines such construction is in an area in which another telecommunications provider(s) may also construct telecommunications facilities in the future, city may require the franchisee to construct excess conduit capacity in the public ways, provided the expense of such excess capacity shall be borne by the city (calculated as the difference between what franchisee would have paid for the construction of its conduit and the additional cost only of the excess conduit). Franchisee may either lease the excess conduit to city at a rate of $1.00 for the term of the franchise (in which case the city will be permitted to sublease the excess conduit at its sole discretion), or franchisee may manage the excess conduit itself and be permitted to charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional conduit space, provided such lease revenues shall be first applied to reimburse city for its actual contribution to the construction of the excess conduit (plus interest compounded at the rate the city invested its funds during the time in question). [Ord. 1316 § 105, 2003.]


20.08.190 Franchisee occupancy of city-owned conduit.

In furtherance of the same objectives of DMMC 20.08.180, if city owns or leases conduit in the path of franchisee’s proposed telecommunications facilities, and provided it is technologically feasible for franchisee to occupy the conduit owned or leased by city, franchisee shall be required to occupy the conduit owned or leased by city in order to reduce the necessity to excavate the public way. Franchisee shall pay to city a fee for such occupancy which shall be the cost franchisee would have expended to construct its own conduit from the outset, as certified by the franchisee’s engineer and approved by the city engineer. City and franchisee may agree to amortize the fee through annual payments to city over the term of the franchise, including the time value of money. [Ord. 1316 § 106, 2003.]


20.08.200 Construction surety.

Prior to issuance of a construction permit, the permittee shall provide a construction bond, as provided in this title. [Ord. 1316 § 107, 2003.]


20.08.210 Compliance with One Number Locator Service.

All licensees and franchisees shall, before commencing any construction in the public ways, comply with all regulations of chapter 19.122 RCW, the One Number Locator Service. [Ord. 1316 § 108, 2003.]

The application fee shall be established by resolution in the sole discretion of the city council and shall be a minimum of $2,500, with the maximum fee established depending upon estimated reasonable city costs and expenditures in review of the application. Disputes in the amount required by city shall be resolved by the hearing examiner in the procedure established pursuant to DMMC 20.10.050. All franchise and license applicants shall deposit the application fee with the city. This application fee shall be applied towards actual expenses and costs of the city. Any unencumbered application fees shall be refunded to the applicant upon written request of the applicant, but in no event earlier than 60 days after granting or denial of the permit. [Ord. 1316 § 109, 2003.]


20.09.020 Refund.

An applicant whose license or franchise application has been withdrawn, abandoned or denied shall, within 60 days of its application and review fee payment, be refunded the balance of its deposit under this section, less all ascertainable costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with the application. [Ord. 1316 § 110, 2003.]


20.09.030 Other city costs.

All grantees shall, within 30 days after written demand therefor, reimburse the city for all direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with any modification, amendment, renewal or transfer of the license or franchise. [Ord. 1316 § 111, 2003.]


20.09.040 Reserved compensation for public ways.

The city reserves its right to fix a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid for the authorization granted to a grantee including permit fees and charges as provided in chapter 12.04 DMMC, the city’s right-of way use code. Nothing in this title shall prohibit the city and a grantee from agreeing upon the compensation. [Ord. 1316 § 112, 2003.]


20.09.050 Compensation for city property.

If the right is granted, by lease, license, franchise or other manner, to use and occupy city property for the installation or use of telecommunications facilities, the compensation to be paid shall be fixed by the city. [Ord. 1316 § 113, 2003.]


20.09.060 Construction permit fee.

Prior to issuance of a construction permit for a project on, under, over or through city property, including rights-of-way, the permittee shall pay a permit fee equal to $1,000 or 0.75 percent of the estimated cost of constructing the telecommunications facilities, as certified by the applicant’s engineer and approved by the city engineer, whichever is greater. The purpose of the construction permit fee shall be to recover city’s actual attributable costs, expenses, damage or public way value diminution as a result of permittee’s occupancy of the public way. City hereby finds that it must at this time attribute costs, expenses, damage, and diminution of value to permittee until such time as actual costs can be ascertained. This results from the inability of city to ascertain the number and type of all public way permittees hereunder as well as the extent and nature of all future such occupancy. Therefore, the city shall within six months of February 4, 2003, commence a study to analyze the cost to the city of managing the city public ways, after which the city shall review the fees of this chapter and chapter 12.04 DMMC, the city’s right-of-way use code, and adjust them to the extent city determines in its sole discretion is necessary, if any, to more accurately represent ascertainable actual costs associated with future permittee’s occupancy. In no event shall construction permit fees received prior to such study and analysis be refunded or increased. [Ord. 1316 § 114, 2003.]


20.09.070 Annual fees.

Each grantee shall pay an annual fee to the city equal to the city’s costs in connection with reviewing, inspecting and supervising the use and occupancy of the public way. [Ord. 1316 § 115, 2003.]


20.09.080 Regulatory fees and compensation not a tax.

The fees, charges and fines provided for in this chapter are separate from, and additional to, any and all federal, state, local, and city taxes as may be levied, imposed or due from a telecommunications carrier or provider, its customers or subscribers or on account of the lease, sale, delivery or transmission of telecommunications services. [Ord. 1316 § 116, 2003.]


20.09.090 City manager authorized to set and modify fees.

The city manager is authorized to set or modify any and all fees, charges or assessments established under this title by administrative order(s) which shall be filed with and maintained by the city clerk. [Ord. 1316 § 117, 2003.]


Chapter 20.10 ELIGIBLE FACILITY REQUESTS AND APPEALS

Sections

20.10.010    Purpose.

20.10.020    Eligible facilities request.

20.10.030    Collocation.

20.10.040    New wireless communication facilities.

20.10.050    An administrative appeal of administrative decision.


20.10.010 Purpose.

Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) have, pursuant to the authority granted by 47 USC 253(c) and 47 USC 332(a), required local governments to act on wireless communication facility applications within a reasonable period of time and have established time limits or “shot clocks” for local review. The Washington State Legislature has also adopted similar limitations under the provisions of chapter 35.99 RCW. Accordingly, the City adopts the following time limits for review of applications for eligible facility requests, small cell permits, and other approvals for service providers of telecommunication services. [Ord. 1699 § 3 (part), 2018.]


20.10.020 Eligible facilities request.

(1) Application Review.

(a) Application. The City Manager shall prepare and make publicly available an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for the City to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities request. The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification.

(b) Type of Review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request pursuant to this chapter, the City Manager shall review such application to determine whether the application qualifies as an eligible facilities request.

(c) Time Frame for Review. Within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this chapter, the City Manager shall approve the application unless the City Manager determines that the application is not covered by this section.

(d) Tolling of the Time Frame for Review. The 60-day review period begins to run when the application is filed and may be tolled only by mutual agreement by the City Manager and the applicant or in cases where the City Manager determines that the application is incomplete. The time frame for review of an eligible facilities request is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.

(i) To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the City Manager shall provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application.

(ii) The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the City Manager notice of incompleteness.

(iii) Following a supplemental submission, the City Manager will notify the applicant within 10 days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this subsection. Second or subsequent notice of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.

(e) Determination That Application Is Not an Eligible Facilities Request. If the City Manager determines that the applicant’s request does not qualify as an eligible facilities request, the City Manager shall deny the application. To the extent additional information is necessary, the City Manager may request such information from the applicant to evaluate the application under other provisions of this chapter and applicable law.

(f) Failure to Act. In the event the City Manager fails to approve or deny a request for an eligible facilities request within the time frame for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the City Manager in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted.

(g) Remedies. Both the applicant and the City may bring claims related to Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act to any court of competent jurisdiction. [Ord. 1699 § 3 (part), 2018.]


20.10.030 Collocation.

Eligible collocations other than those defined in DMMC 20.07.080 shall be processed within 90 days of receipt of a complete application. The City Manager will notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of an application whether it is complete or if additional information is required. The term collocation shall not apply to the initial placement of a small cell facility on a utility pole or on any other base station or tower that was not constructed for the sole or primary purpose of an FCC licensed antenna and their associated facilities. [Ord. 1699 § 3 (part), 2018.]


20.10.040 New wireless communication facilities.

New wireless communications facilities shall be processed within 150 days of receipt of a complete application. The City Manager will notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of an application whether it is complete or if additional information is required. [Ord. 1699 § 3 (part), 2018.]


20.10.050 An administrative appeal of administrative decision.

A decision of the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee made in accordance with this Title, including assessment of fees as provided herein, shall be considered a final administrative decision. A person aggrieved by a decision of the City Manager or designee made pursuant to this Title may appeal such decision to the Hearing Examiner in accordance with the Hearing Examiner Code, chapter 18.240 DMMC. The time and the form of such appeals are provided in chapter 18.240 DMMC; provided, however, that:

(1) The processes and procedures described in chapter 18.240 DMMC shall be expedited and adjusted, as necessary, to comply with provisions of this chapter and stated federal law.

(2) Nothing herein shall be interpreted to provide for an appeal of a decision of the City Council to approve, deny or conditionally approve the grant of a franchise or license to use the public rights-of-way.

(3) The procedures in this chapter are not land use actions and are not subject to the provisions of RCW 36.70B.070 through 36.70B.130. See DMMC 18.20.060 and RCW 36.70B.140(1). [Ord. 1699 § 3 (part), 2018.]
