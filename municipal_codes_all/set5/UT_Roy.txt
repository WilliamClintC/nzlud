The Municipal Code of Roy, Utah was initially published by Sterling Codifiers and their code was last updated by ordinance 1037 passed December 7, 2010. In 2017, codification and administration of the Municipal Code began in-­house under the direction of the City Recorder and with the assistance of Municipal Code Online, Inc. It is current as of November 2017. This Municipal Code shall be cited as the Roy Municipal Code or “RMC” as an acronym. This Municipal Code maintains a structure by subject matter using a hyphenated numbering system identifying the title, chapter, and section (for example: 1-01-010).

The first number in the sequence (1-01-010) designates the Title level, as named in the Table of Contents
The second series of numbers (1-01-010) designates the Chapter level, as named in the Table of Contents
The last series (1-01-010) designates the Section level
This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching the Municipal Code and to assist in subsequent codification as new ordinances are added to the Municipal Code. Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed for future use and may be marked “Reserved” to ease internal expansion.

To outline, give structure, and more granularly reference the legislation herein, the following list order (or pattern of ascending alphanumeric characters) is used: A, 1, a, (1), (A), (a). Drafting legislation with this list order better reconciles the content in local software and hard copies, with the content in this online code.

The legislative history beneath a legislation's content identifies the specific legal sources, and may be provided to substantiate the online code.

The Municipal Code is supplemented from time­ to ­time with amendments and additions made by Roy City. The specific legal sources that comprise this Municipal Code have been adapted during the codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies between the online Municipal Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal Code Online, Inc., provides a searchable database of the Municipal Code for easy reference and convenience.

NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MUNICIPAL CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT THE CITY RECORDER.

The order shall be entered in the minutes of the governing body. The order shall provide at least three (3) hours' notice of the special meeting and notice thereof shall be served by the city recorder on each member who did not sign the order by delivering the notice personally or by leaving it at the member's usual place of abode.

The number of members of the city council necessary to constitute a quorum is three (3) or more.

Minimum Vote Required: The minimum number of yes votes required to pass any ordinance, resolution or to take any action by the governing body, unless otherwise prescribed by law, shall be a majority of the members of the quorum, and shall never be less than three (3) yes votes.

A majority of the members of the city council, regardless of number, may fill any vacancy in the governing body.
Reconsideration: Any action taken by the city council shall not be reconsidered or rescinded at any special meeting unless the number of members of the governing body present at the special meeting is equal to or greater than the number of members present at the meeting when the action was approved.

1-12-3: GUIDELINES ADVISORY
1-12-4: REVIEW OF DECISION
1-12-5: REVIEWING GUIDELINES
1-12-6: RESULTS OF REVIEW

1-12-1: DEFINED
Definition: "Constitutional taking" means actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property that might require compensation to a private real property owner because of:
The fifth or fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States;
Article 1, section 22, of the Utah constitution;
Any court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of private real property by a government entity.
Exception: Actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property is not a constitutional taking if the physical taking or exaction:
Bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest; and
Is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an individualized property basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development on the legitimate government interest.
(Ord. 718, 1-31-1995)

1-12-2: ENACTMENT; POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
There is an underlying policy in the city strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of uncertainty and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the public's right to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the constitution. Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking.

To annex territory if the city determines it is feasible to serve the area with utilities and other municipal services within a reasonable time.
To annex property which will not have an adverse environmental impact on the immediate area or the total community.
(Ord., 6-11-1974)

1-13-6: SECURING LAND FOR PUBLIC SITES
The city shall not require the donation of land for public sites; however, the city shall be granted the option to secure land for public sites, as it may determine, which option may be exercised between the time of annexation and acceptance of any subdivision plat. The city shall acquire such sites at their fair unimproved value as of the time of annexation and as determined by competent appraisal in the event mutual agreement cannot be reached. If the property is to be appraised, each party shall appoint a disinterested appraiser and they in turn shall choose a disinterested third party. The decision of a majority shall be binding. The cost thereof shall be borne equally. The city shall be responsible for the cost of any off site improvements with respect to such sites.
A similar option shall be granted to the appropriate school district with respect to public school sites, the terms thereof to be agreed upon between the annexing parties and the school district. The purchase price of such land shall include the necessary improvements.

The zoning of areas to be annexed shall be governed and controlled at all times by the zoning regulations of the city.

(Ord., 6-11-1974)

1-13-10: FEES AND CHARGES
Nonreturnable Application Fee: All applicants for annexation shall pay an application fee which shall be established by the city council to cover costs of processing. This amount shall be paid at the time the petition for annexation is filed, said fee to be nonreturnable to applicant.
Utility Services And Facilities Fees: There shall also be paid to the city by the owners of, or parties of interest in, land petitioning for annexation such sum of money per acre or portion thereof as the city council may require, giving due consideration to:
The projected utilities service or facilities expected to be required;
The reasonably expected cost of providing utility service lines or facilities to serve such lands with municipal utility service; and
The cost of facilities, utilities and services already installed which would serve or be in a position to serve the area sought to be annexed. Such payment shall be made on or before five (5) years from the effective date of annexation in one sum or in such installments as the city council shall determine, and, if in installments, the city council shall further determine the amounts and due dates of each thereof. Upon application and upon a showing of hardship or other extenuating circumstance satisfactory to the city council, and if in the judgment of the city council it shall appear that its interest will not suffer substantial prejudice thereby, the city council may from time to time extend the time of payment of all or any part of such obligation; provided, that no extension for more than two (2) years shall be granted at any one time; and provided further, that no extension shall be granted at any time without a partial payment of the obligation in such amount and at such time as the city council shall determine.
Contract And Lien For Security: To secure such payments, the petitioners and all parties in interest shall enter into a written contract granting the city a lien on the annexing lands. The contract may contain such other reasonable provisions relating to the installation of municipal utility service lines and facilities and the furnishing of municipal utility service as the city council shall deem fair and proper and agreed upon with the petitioners. The contract and lien shall be signed by all parties of interest therein and recorded. Upon request, and upon payment in full of that portion of the entire sum of money fairly allocable to a particular portion of the land subject to such lien, partial releases of the lien upon such portion of the lands shall be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the city; provided, that such releases, in the judgment of the city, shall not adversely affect the adequacy of the security remaining for the unpaid balance of the total sum to be paid; and provided further, that the partial release of liens, in the judgment of the city, shall not be contrary to the interests of the city from the standpoint of the orderly development of the lands involved.
Owners Of Land Not Joining Petition For Annexation:
In the event territory annexed includes lands of owners who have not joined in the petition for annexation, said property may be annexed as provided herein and those who have not agreed to pay or executed a contract agreeing to pay the sums specified in subsection C of this section, allocable to their respective lands, the city council may establish municipal utility connection fees as a prerequisite to the rendering of municipal utility service to the lands. The connection fee shall be, as near as practicable, the monetary equivalent of the money payable by petitioners in connection with such annexation, due regard being given, as aforesaid, to the expected requirements for utility service or facilities and the expected cost of providing utility service lines or facilities to serve the lands. Thereafter no connection to any municipal utility service may be made to serve such lands or any part thereof, and no municipal utility service shall be rendered to the lands or the occupants thereof or facilities constructed therefor unless such connection fee for such utilities or facilities serving the lands shall first be paid.
In lieu of the establishment of such equivalent connection fees, the city may at its option charge and collect from the owners of such lands and their grantees and successors in interest, a sum equivalent to the per acre annexation charge currently being made as a condition precedent to the approval of any subdivision plat or the issuance of any building permit for any type of construction, giving due regard to the intended development, the requirements for services and facilities and the cost or estimated cost of providing the same.
Exemptions: No money shall be payable and no utility connection fees in lieu thereof shall be charged or payable with respect to the annexation of lands owned or the beneficial use of which is preempted by or dedicated to the public, by any tax exempt, governmental, charitable, educational or religious body or organization; provided, that in the event the lands ever cease to be owned by or devoted to any exempt use as above recited, then in such event the city may charge and collect the fees or charges provided for and in accordance with subsection C of this section with respect thereto.
Services Provided: After annexation and within a reasonable time after request therefor, the annexation fees aforesaid having been paid or agreed to be paid within the time and in the manner specified by the city council, the city shall provide utility service lines at a point on or which it determines to be reasonably accessible to the newly annexed lands.
(Ord., 6-11-1974)

1-13-11: ASSUMPTION OF OUTSTANDING BOND OBLIGATIONS
Outstanding bonded obligations involving special service districts, schools, etc., shall be paid by the annexing parties or assumed under mutually satisfactory agreements between and among the city, the district and the annexers.

(Ord., 6-11-1974)

1-13-12: STREETS
In territory traversed or to be traversed by major streets, forming a part of the major street system, rights of way, as required by the city, shall be provided. An agreement covering the improvement of such major streets shall be reached prior to annexation.
Existing streets and roads shall be brought to a standard of improvement mutually agreed upon by the annexers and the city.
(Ord., 6-11-1974)

3-7-1: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
Findings: Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Pap's A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v.

Freedberg, 724 F.Supp. 851 (D. Utah 1989); and other cases; and on testimony to Congress in 136 Cong. Rec. S 8987; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 14519; 135 Cong. Rec. S 5636; 134 Cong. Rec. E 3750; and reports of secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona - 1984: Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Houston, Texas - 1997; Utahpolis, Utah; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978: Austin, Texas - 1986; Seattle, Washington - 1989; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Cleveland, Ohio; and Dallas, Texas - 1997; St. Croix County, Wisconsin - 1993; Bellevue, Washington, - 1998; Newport News, Virginia - 1996; New York Times Square study - 1994; Phoenix, Arizona - 1995-98; and also on findings from the paper entitled strip clubs according to strippers: exposing workplace sexual violence by Kelly Holsopple, program director, freedom and justice center for prostitution resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and from sexually oriented businesses: an insider's view by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan house committee on ethics and constitutional law, Jan. 12, 2000, and the report of the attorney general's working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses (June 6, 1989, state of Minnesota), the city council finds:
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism in this city to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
Certain employees of unregulated "sexually oriented businesses" defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
Offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses, or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs.
Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis, salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections, chlamydia, mycoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and chancroid.
According to research from the Kaiser family foundation, an estimated six hundred fifty thousand (650,000) to nine hundred thousand (900,000) Americans are infected with HIV. The number of new HIV infections occurring each year is now about forty one thousand (41,000). Men and women of all races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
Relevant statistics revealed that a total of one thousand six hundred seventy two (1,672) AIDS cases had been reported in Utah as of January 1, 1999. Utah has required HIV case reporting since 1989, and shows one thousand five hundred fifty (1,550) people currently living with HIV (762) or AIDS (788) in the state.
The centers for disease control and prevention estimates that as many as one in three (3) people with HIV do not know they are infected.
The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with thirty three thousand six hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982 and forty five thousand two hundred (45,200) through November of 1990.
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over five hundred thousand (500,000) cases being reported in 1990.
The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g., findings of U.S. department of health and human services.
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
The findings noted in subsections B1 through B15 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity, child pornography, and to minors, materials harmful to them.
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
The fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
The barring of such individuals from employment in sexually oriented businesses for a specified period of years serves to prevent distribution of illegal material, to prevent conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, and to preclude the establishment of criminal enterprises within the city.
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

No discount shall be provided to any landlord unless and until the business license division certifies that the requirements of this section and all other requirements of the good landlord incentive program have been met.

The landlord, or the landlord's bona fide agent for all aspects of property management, and all managers of the landlord responsible for the day to day management of the rental dwellings must complete a landlord training approved by the city within the two (2) year period immediately preceding the date of application or certification. First time applicants to the Good Landlord Incentive Program shall be required to complete the training within six (6) months of the date of application; failure to complete the training program within the six (6) month time frame shall be grounds for disqualification from the program. Owners will be required to successfully complete the training program every two years after initial training certification.
If the property is held in joint or common ownership only one of the owners need apply and qualify under the program. 
The landlord must require complete rental applications and background checks on all prospective adult tenants and all adult tenants occupying the premises. The application must state that any false information provided on the application will be grounds for denial or eviction.

Valid picture ID is presented to verify the identity of the applicant.

The landlord agrees to not knowingly rent to any person who has been convicted of any crime involving any threat or damage to property or person, nor for any crime which, had it been committed on the landlord's premises, would have disturbed the peaceful enjoyment of other tenants; this shall include the sale, manufacture or distribution of any controlled substance. Program compliance is based on whether the conviction, or release from probation or parole, occurred within four (4) years of the date of a rental application. 
The landlord agrees to provide in its leases or rental agreements that tenants may be evicted if they engage in illegal drug use, sale, manufacture, distribution, or other criminal activity on or near the rental premises, and the landlord agrees to commence and pursue eviction proceedings when the landlord is aware that a violation of such provision exists.

Dangerous Dog:
Euthanasia; Registration: If the supervisor of animal control determines that an animal is a "dangerous dog", as defined in this chapter, he shall first attempt to obtain the consent of the animal owner to have the animal euthanized. If the owner declines and the animal control supervisor believes that conditions warrant, he may have the animal registered as a dangerous dog and have it kept in a manner hereafter outlined. If the supervisor of animal control believes that the best action is to have the court order the destruction of the animal, he shall file for an abatement hearing to determine if the animal should be euthanized, registered as a dangerous dog or take what other action the court deems appropriate.
Requirements For Registration: It shall be unlawful for any owner to keep, harbor or maintain a dangerous dog within the limits of the city without a certificate of registration issued by the supervisor of animal control. A dangerous dog shall not be registered by the supervisor of animal control unless the owner shall meet all requirements set for maintenance of a biting dog as well as all of the following requirements:
The owner shall, on or prior to the effective date of such registration, have an enclosure as described in subsection C of this section, for the dangerous dog on the property where the dangerous dog will be kept, harbored or maintained.
The owner shall display a sign on the premises warning that there is a dangerous dog on the premises.

The owner shall, at his own expense, have the dog permanently identified by either having the licensing number assigned by the city to such dangerous dog tattooed upon the dog by a licensed veterinarian or a person trained as a tattooist; or having the dog implanted with a microchip that the owner shall purchase from the city for the purpose of identifying dangerous dogs. The tattoo shall be placed on the left rear thigh of the animal. The supervisor of animal control may otherwise designate the particular location of the tattoo.
The owner shall at all times cause the dangerous dog to wear a collar of a color and type designated by the supervisor of animal control so that the animal may be readily identified as a dangerous dog.
The owner shall at his own expense have the dangerous dog spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian and file proof with the supervisor of animal control.
The owner shall present to the supervisor of animal control proof that the owner or keeper has procured liability insurance in the amount of at least three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00), covering any damage or injury which may be caused by such dangerous dog during the twelve (12) month period for which licensing is sought, which policy shall contain a provision guaranteeing the animal control department will be notified by the insurance company of any cancellation, termination or expiration of the liability insurance policy. Such proof of insurance shall be in such form as approved by the office of the city attorney.
The owner shall sign a statement attesting that:
The owner shall abide by the requirements of registration and the ordinances as they pertain to the control of the dangerous dog within the city.
The owner shall notify the animal control department immediately if a dangerous dog is on the loose, is unconfined or has attacked another animal or a human being. If the dangerous dog has died, been sold or given away, the owner shall notify the supervisor of animal control by the end of the next business day and shall also provide the animal control department with the name, address and phone number of the new owner of the dangerous dog.
The owner shall agree to inspection of the premises in order to ensure compliance with the ordinances controlling dangerous dogs.

If a dangerous dog is seized or impounded, the owner shall have ten (10) calendar days to petition the court for review of the circumstance and to determine if the animal shall be returned or euthanized. All cost for keeping any dog during this time shall be the full responsibility of the owner regardless if the owner does not request the dog's return. If no petition has been filed, the dangerous dog may be euthanized.
If the actual owner of a dangerous dog is under the age of eighteen (18) years, the parent or guardian of that minor shall be responsible for compliance with the ordinances of the city in the matter of registration and control of a dangerous dog.
If the court should determine that the best resolution of a dangerous dog problem is to relocate it outside of the corporate limits of the city, it shall require the owner to notify any animal control or police agency responsible for that geographical location, and ensure that all requirements of that agency be met and show proof to the court of compliance.
Confinement Of Dangerous Dogs: No person owning or having custody or control of any dog known by such person to have inflicted a bite upon another animal or person, or to be dangerous as determined by the supervisor of animal control or the court, shall permit it to run at large or permit it to run loose on or within their premises in such a manner as to endanger life or limb of any person lawfully entering such premises. Any person owning or having custody of a dog:
That has been classified as a biting dog shall be secured within the house, kept within a fenced backyard or secured while on a leash or chain in such a manner as to preclude it from inflicting any further bites upon any animal or person lawfully entering the premises of the owner.

The time for holding said animals under law (see RMC 5-1-23) shall begin at the end of the three (3) working days herein set. If upon such hearing, the court finds that the charge of dangerousness or nuisance is sustained and that the destruction of such animal is the most appropriate manner to abate the same, it shall issue its written order for such destruction, and such order shall be executed within five (5) days thereafter. The court may issue such other order it deems appropriate to abate dangerous dogs or public nuisance animals under this chapter. If the court allows the animal to be re moved from the limits of the city to the limits of another jurisdiction, then that animal's owner shall be required to contact the animal control department or police agency having jurisdiction there and meet any restrictions set by law pertaining to the maintenance of an animal engaging in the activity for which it is being abated, and show proof to the court.

7-4-1: DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND INTENT; SCOPE
Declaration Of Findings And Intent:
Rights Of Way: The city finds that the rights of way within the city:
Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the city;
Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;
Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well-being of the city and its citizens; and
Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement, relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
Compensation: The city finds that the city should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
Local Concern: The city finds that while telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights of way, municipal franchising and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The city finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational and community services.
Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:
Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;
Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the city infrastructure;
Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of way; and
Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act") [P.L. No. 96-104].
Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts this telecommunications chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights of way, pursuant to common law, the Utah constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights of way by providers as expressly set forth by section 253 of the act.
Scope: This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of the rights of way, including providers of both the system and service, those providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system but who only provide services. This chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the city prior to the effective date hereof, whether operating with or without a franchise as set forth in RMC 7-4-12B.
Excluded Activity:
Cable TV: This chapter shall not apply to cable television operators otherwise regulated by the city (the "cable television ordinance").
Wireless Services: This chapter shall not apply to personal wireless service facilities.
Provisions Applicable To Excluded Providers: Providers excused by other law that prohibits the city from requiring a franchise shall not be required to obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements imposed by this chapter through the exercise of the city's police power and not preempted by other law shall be applicable.

7-4-3: FRANCHISE REQUIRED
Nonexclusive Franchise: The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction and maintenance of systems in the city's rights of way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the city and provider.
Every Provider Must Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services using the rights of way, and every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights of way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights of way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or subleased, except as may be expressly provided in the franchise agreement. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before colocating its system on the property of others, including the city's property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date hereof shall request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety (90) days of the effective date hereof. If such request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of RMC 7-4-9D.
Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system on, over and under the rights of way in order to provide services.
Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner.
(Ord. 875, 9-5-2000)

7-4-4: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS
Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the following obligations:
Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, five hundred dollars ($500.00) as a nonrefundable application fee.
Franchise Fees: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or business license tax enacted by the city.
Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an excavation permit as required by the city.
Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of the close of each calendar month.
Fee Statement And Certification: Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its accuracy.
Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties (including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or provider initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this chapter or a franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. Any costs associated with any work to be done by the public works department to provide space on city owned poles shall be borne by the provider. In the event the parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American arbitration association.
Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights of way, the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter.
Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the city owned poles are not waived and remain applicable.
Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation; provided, that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs associated with its franchise that may be required by law.
(Ord. 875, 9-5-2000)

7-4-5: APPLICATION FOR FRANCHISE

The application form may be changed by the city manager so long as such changes request information that is consistent with this chapter. Such application form, as amended, is incorporated by reference. (Ord. 875, 9-5-2000; amd. 2003 Code)
Application Criteria: In making a determination as to an application filed pursuant to this chapter, the city may, but shall not be limited to, request the following from the provider:
A copy of the order from the PSC granting a certificate of convenience and necessity, if any is necessary for provider's offering of services within the state.
Certification of the provider's financial ability to compensate the city for provider's intrusion, maintenance and use of the rights of way during the franchise term proposed by the provider;

Franchise Determination: The city, in its discretion, shall determine the award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations relevant to the use of the rights of way, without competitive bidding.
(Ord. 875, 9-5-2000)

7-4-6: CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
General Requirement: No provider shall receive a franchise unless it agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this section governing construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any other reasonable requirements or procedures specified by the city or the franchise, including requirements regarding locating and sharing in the cost of colocating portions of the system with other systems or with city utilities. A provider shall obtain an excavation permit, pursuant to city requirements, before commencing any work in the rights of way.
Quality: All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by federal law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the system, including, without limitation, any means used to distribute signals over or within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or the quality of service or reliability is unsatisfactory, then a provider shall, at its own cost and expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
Licenses And Permits: A provider shall have the sole responsibility for diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, maintain, upgrade or repair the system, including, but not limited to, any necessary approvals from persons and/or the city to use private property, easements, poles and conduits. A provider shall obtain any required permit, license, approval or authorization, including, but not limited to, excavation permits, pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the activity for which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.
Relocation Of System:
New Grades Or Lines: If the grades or lines of any rights of way are changed at any time in a manner affecting the system, then a provider shall comply with the requirements of the excavation ordinance.
City Authority To Move System In Emergency: The city may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined by the city in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the system and appurtenances on, over or under the rights of way of the city, in which event the city shall not be liable therefor to a provider. The city shall notify a provider in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon as possible and in no case later than the next business day following any action taken under this section. Notice shall be given as provided in RMC 7-4-11D.
Provider Required To Temporarily Move System For Third Party: A provider shall, upon prior reasonable written notice by the city or any person holding a permit to move any structure, and within the time that is reasonable under the circumstances, temporarily move any part of its system to permit the moving of said structure. A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the city for any such movement of its systems.
Rights Of Way Change; Obligation To Move System: When the city is changing rights of way and makes a written request, a provider is required to move or remove its system from the rights of way, without cost to the city, to the extent provided in the excavation ordinance. This obligation does not apply to systems originally located on private property pursuant to a private easement, which property was later incorporated into the rights of way, if that private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit.
Protect Structures: In connection with the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city. A provider shall obtain the prior written consent of the city to alter any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or any other municipal structure on, over or under the rights of way of the city required because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration shall be made by the city or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified by the city, any municipal structure or any other rights of way of the city involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of a provider pursuant to the franchise.
No Obstruction: In connection with the construction, maintenance, upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not unreasonably obstruct the rights of way of fixed guideway systems, railways, passenger travel, or other traffic to, from or within the city without the prior consent of the appropriate authorities.
Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense, undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences, barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local requirements, including, but not limited to, the national electrical safety code.
Repair: After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the sole determination of the city, an eminent danger exists, any rights of way within the city which are disturbed or damaged during the construction, maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be repaired by the city at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the city shall submit to such a provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the rights of ways intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the statement, pay to the city the entire amount thereof.
System Maintenance: A provider shall:
Install and maintain all parts of its system in a nondangerous condition throughout the entire period of its franchise.
Install and maintain its system in accordance with standard prudent engineering practices and shall conform, when applicable, with the national electrical safety code and all applicable other federal, state and local laws or regulations.

A provider shall also indemnify the city as set forth in the franchise.
Oversight: The city shall have the right to oversee, regulate and inspect periodically the construction, maintenance and upgrade of the system, and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the city at all times throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of limitations.

As used herein, "as built" maps include "file construction prints". Maps shall be drawn to scale. "As built" maps, including the compatible electronic format, as provided above, shall be submitted within thirty (30) days of completion of work or within thirty (30) days after completion of modification and repairs.

Such notification and labeling shall be the sole responsibility of the provider.
Provider's Expense: All reports and records required under this chapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as otherwise provided in this chapter or a franchise.
Right Of Inspection: For the purpose of verifying the correct amount of the franchise fee, the books and records of the provider pertaining thereto shall be open to inspection or audit by duly authorized representatives of the city at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to inspect or audit the books and records; provided, that the city shall not audit the books and records of the provider more often than annually. The provider agrees to reimburse the city the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the compensation due the city for the period of such audit. In the event the accounting rendered to the city by the provider herein is found to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty (30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the city may accept any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the city shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or is later found to be incorrect.

Enforcement And Remedies:
Enforcement; City Designee: The city is responsible for enforcing and administering this chapter, and the city or its designee, as appointed by the city manager, is authorized to give any notice required by law or under any franchise agreement.

Force Majeure: In the event a provider's performance of any of the terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise is prevented by a cause or event not within a provider's control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of a provider shall include, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, failure or loss of utilities, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides and fires.
Extended Operation And Continuity Of Services:
Continuation After Expiration: Upon either expiration or revocation of a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, the city shall have discretion to permit a provider to continue to operate its system or provide services for an extended period of time not to exceed six (6) months from the date of such expiration or revocation. A provider shall continue to operate its system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant to this chapter.
Continuation By Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier: If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall be permitted to continue to operate its system and provide services without regard to revocation or expiration, but shall be obligated to negotiate a renewal in good faith.
Removal Or Abandonment Of Franchise Property:
Abandoned System: In the event that:
The use of any portion of the system is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, and thirty (30) days after no response to written notice from the city to the last known address of provider;
Any system has been installed in the rights of way without complying with the requirements of this chapter or franchise; or
The provisions of RMC 7-4-3E are applicable and no franchise is granted, a provider, except the provider who is an incumbent local exchange carrier, shall be deemed to have abandoned such system.
Removal Of Abandoned System: The city, upon such terms as it may impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing any system, or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any affected rights of way to their former state at the time such system was installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights of way in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles or attachments. The city shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the rights of way cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal.

Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the Franchising Authority's intention to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the Franchise for violations of the Franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the Subscribers within the Service Area, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the Grantee which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the Franchising Authority and/or Subscribers.

Irrigation ditches 
All existing irrigation ditches located on the site or straddling a site property boundary shall be piped with a sufficient size pipe and shall be coordinated with water user. 
Property owners are responsible for the protection of irrigation ditches in accordance with this ordinance. 
Discharges to private ditches require written approval from the ditch owners and design shall comply with the terms of approvals and The Guidance Document for Stormwater Management and the Land Disturbance Permit.
Piping of ditches and modification to diversion boxes for shared stormwater irrigation facilities as determined by the City Engineer require documented coordination with ditch owners or representative but are not required to receive written approval of ditch owners. Design and coordination requirements shall comply with the Stormwater Design Standards and Regulations and the Land Disturbance Permit documents. 
Stormwater design and BMP manuals. 
Adoption. The municipality adopts as its stormwater design and best management practices (BMP) manuals the  following publications, which are incorporated by reference this ordinance as is fully set out herein: 
Roy City Stormwater Master Plan. 
Guidance Document for Stormwater Management 
These manuals include a list of acceptable BMPs and include specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manuals may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the governing body of the City, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local maintenance experience. Stormwater facilities that are designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP  criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
General performance criteria  for stormwater management. Unless granted a waiver or judged by the City Engineer to be exempt, the following post construction performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites: 
Design of storm drain systems within City boundaries and that discharge into a Roy City storm drain system requires direct supervision of a Utah registered professional engineer. 
Site designs shall control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with design storms specified in this ordinance or in the BMP manual and reduce the generation of post construction stormwater runoff to pre-construction levels according to the BMP manual. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to in infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
Specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP manual to protect stream channels  from degradation. 
Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources such as, cold water fisheries, swimming beaches, recharge areas and water supply reservoirs, may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
Stormwater discharges from hotspots may require the application of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices. 
Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land disturbance permits shall consult with the City Engineer to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. 
Calculations for determining allowable peak flows and runoff volumes as  found in the BMP manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities.
Minimum control requirements. 
Stormwater discharge during all construction activities shall comply with the most current terms as adopted by the State of Utah of the UPDES Stormwater General Permit for Construction Activities, Guidance Document for Stormwater Management and/or requirements set forth by the Building Code, and the State of Utah UPDES requirements. 
Stormwater designs shall meet the multi-stage storm frequency storage and runoff volume requirements as identified in the BMP manual, along with the operation, installation, and maintenance standards in the BMP  manual unless the Stormwater Superintendent has granted the applicant a full or partial waiver for a particular BMP. 
Runoff rates from one lot to another may not exceed pre-existing conditions or in such a manner that may unreasonably and unnecessarily cause more harm than formerly.
If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Stormwater Superintendent may impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
Soil, sediment, and debris brought onto streets and public ways must be removed by the end of the work day by machine, broom or shovel to the satisfaction of the Stormwater Superintendent. Failure to remove the sediment, soil or debris shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance.
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan requirements. Property owners are responsible to manage stormwater runoff and sediment whether in conduit systems or on the surface that traverse or originate on their property, unless this responsibility is relinquished through the terms and conditions of an easement. In order to manage stormwater the Property Owner must develop a stormwater pollution prevention plan and implement the plan. The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall include sufficient information to allow the Stormwater Superintendent to evaluate the environmental and historical characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. To accomplish this goal the stormwater pollution prevention plan shall include the following: 
Project Description - Briefly describe the intended project and proposed land disturbing activity including number of units and structures to be constructed and infrastructure required. 
Topographic Base Map: A 1 = 500 topographic base map of the site which extends a minimum of 1000 feet beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicates: 
Existing surface water drainage including streams, ponds, culverts, ditches, sink holes, wetlands; and the type, size, elevation, etc., of nearest upstream and downstream drainage structures; 
Current land use including all existing structures, locations of utilities, roads, and easements; 
All other existing significant natural and artificial features including a general description of existing land cover. Individual fees and shrubs do not need to be identified. 
Proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities, roads and easements; the limits of clearing and grading;

12-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The legislature of the state of Utah Code Ann. § I0-3-701 and Utah Code Ann. § 17-53-201 seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 958, 12-6-2005)

That the city of Roy elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas of the town having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened and modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

12-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT
The flood hazard areas of Roy City are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.

The second series of numbers (1-01-010) designates the Chapter level, as named in the Table of Contents
The last series (1-01-010) designates the Section level
This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching the Code and to assist in subsequent codification as new ordinances are added to the Code. Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed for future use and may be marked “Reserved” to ease internal expansion.

To outline, give structure, and more granularly reference the legislation herein, the following list order (or pattern of ascending alphanumeric characters) is used: 1, a, i, (1), (A), (a).

The purpose of this Section is to provide supplementary regulations and standards for the development and construction of vibrant, quality multiple family housing developments that enhance and contribute to  the quality of the overall housing stock of the City, and which will promote, protect, and secure the public health, safety and general welfare.

Multi-Family Development – Multi-Family Developments include projects or developments of more than six (6) units where all or any portion of the proposed dwelling units intended for residential occupation share common walls among two or more units, or projects or developments of any number of units that share property outside the dwelling unit in common among one or more owners. Applications for Multi-Family Developments, as herein defined, shall require Site Plan review and approval under the guidance of this Section.
Site Requirements – The provisions and requirements for Multi-Family Development as contained in tables 10-1 and 10-3 of RZC 10-10 shall apply except as otherwise noted by this Section.
Unit Requirements – The following standards and regulations must be considered and applied in the layout and design of Multi-Family Developments:
Number of Units per Building. The City may limit the number of units per building allowed on the basis of perceived building mass, perceived densities or compatibility with surrounding areas, and to improve the function of the site.
Height – Maximum building height is thirty-five feet (35’). Additionally, all multi-family structures of two stories or more will be reviewed with respect to the following elements: perceived height, building mass, compatibility with existing development, and compatibility with future development in the area. It is the developer’s obligation to demonstrate sensitivity to and mitigation of the impacts of height.
Additional Height – May be granted allowing additional height up to 60’ under special circumstances as follows:
Transit Oriented. Developments in close proximity to Commuter Rail or other major hubs of public transit may be granted an exception for additional height if it can be demonstrated that the additional height will not negatively impact the surrounding neighborhoods both commercial and residential, will contribute to the success of the project, and results in a better and more livable design.
Public Purpose. Developments seeking to further a goal or purpose identified by the City which can be facilitated by an exception may be granted additional height if it can be demonstrated that the exception will in fact provide an amenity to the City and/or neighborhood, further the goals of the City toward such a public amenity, or provide the betterment of an existing amenity that benefits the larger City and neighborhood. It must also be demonstrated that the additional height will be used in manner that does not negatively impact the surrounding neighborhoods, commercial or residential.
Access and Circulation – To ensure appropriate access and circulation, the following standards shall apply to all Multi-Family Developments:
Access to Public Right-Of-Way. All Multi-Family development must have access to the public right-of-way. Vehicular service to individual units and buildings may be provided by private access-ways and roads. All private roads and accesses within a Multi-Family Development shall be designated easements for public access, utility and drainage.
Intersection. The intersection of the access to the development and the public right-of-way must provide no less than thirty-six (36) feet of passable asphalt for a distance to be determined by the City Engineer. Reduced widths of passable asphalt at the intersection may be approved to a minimum of thirty (30) feet by the City Engineer.
Width. All access and roadways must provide a minimum of twenty-eight (28) feet of passable asphalt surface. If the design includes a parking component on one side of an access or roadway, a minimum of thirty-two (32) feet of passable asphalt is required.
Pedestrian Access. All accesses and roadways within multi-family projects must provide appropriate pedestrian access to the private or public rights-of-way, and continuous pedestrian access throughout the project on at least one side of the roadway or access. Additionally, pedestrian access to individual buildings not adjacent to a parking area or roadway must also be provided.
Interconnectivity & Circulation. All multi-family development must provide a plan for the integration of proposed buildings, pedestrian and vehicle circulation patterns, parking areas and other systems of interconnected streets, walkways, trails and parking areas to facilitate development or re-development of adjacent and neighboring parcels as may be necessary.
Utilities & Service. All multi-family development must provide a plan for the appropriate installation of utilities on site. The plan must address the potential looping of lines and future connection to facilitate development or re-development of adjacent and neighboring parcels. All multi-family development must also plan for the provision of other services as may be needed, such as waste collection and snow removal.
Parking – Appropriate parking is required for all units, as contained in RZC 10-19, with the following additional considerations:
Reduction. A reduction in parking ratio requirements may be approved if it can be demonstrated that such a reduction of requirements is appropriate because of proximity to a major public transit facility, and will result in an improvement of one or more components of design.
Parking Orientation. Parking areas should be located throughout the proposed development, and where possible must be de-centralized. Where larger parking areas are necessary, buffering of the adjacent development components and of adjacent properties will be required.
Coverage – Maximum coverage of all impervious surfaces in Multi-Family Developments may not exceed a range between 40% - 55%. Factors considered in determining the appropriate impervious surface coverage allowed shall include, but not be limited to, the following: project size, density, adjacent densities, the nature of amenities provided by the proposed development, and the use of pervious and semi-pervious concretes, pavers, permeable paving, and other technology that allows hard surfacing which is not fully impervious.
Density Bonus. In the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts, an increase in density, up to a total of fifteen (15) units per acre, may be awarded for projects providing exceptional open space creation, green infrastructure preservation or enhancement, the use of sustainable development techniques or construction materials, exceptional amenities, or amenities that are relatable to and provide interconnection with the larger community (examples may include an amphitheater, public access park, extension of an adjacent park or addition of facilities, trails, trail-heads, etc.).
Open Space and Amenities Required – All Multi-Family Developments shall provide a plan for open space and amenities in accordance with the following:
Open Space. All Multi-Family Developments shall provide a minimum base open space of twenty percent (20%) for projects up to 20 units. Developments with more than twenty (20) units shall provide between 25% and 30% base open space. Base open space must consist of specifically planned, usable or preserved areas. Remnant, unused areas within a project may not be included in the calculation of base open space. If sustainable techniques and materials are successfully incorporated into the development (for example, high-albedo or garden roofs), a proportion of the open-space and amenity requirement may be reduced.
Common Amenity Required. All Multi-Family Developments are required to plan for and to provide specific amenities within the open space. Amenities must be usable and accessible to all units in the development.
Preserved Amenity/Open Space. The preservation of existing open spaces as an amenity should be encouraged (creeks, tree-stands, slopes, etc.). To that end, the developer may propose such preservation to satisfy the requirements of this Section in whole or in part. Preserved open space must be nearly adjacent to a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the units in a development if the preserved open space is intended to satisfy the entirety of the requirement under this Section.
Pedestrian and Trail Connections. Continuous pedestrian walkways and trails may be a component of the open space and amenity requirements. Where determined to be applicable, connection of such pathways to sidewalks or trails in the larger area is required.
Community Oriented Amenities & Open Space. Where it is possible to relate the amenities and/or open space of Multi-Family development to the larger community, to adjacent public open space or recreation infrastructure, or to the amenities and open space of adjoining projects, the developer may propose such variations, reductions or modifications as are appropriate to facilitate that end. The City may approve the variations, reductions or modifications, upon finding that the plan to adjoin or enhance outside open space and amenities also contributes to the stabilization of surrounding neighborhoods, the adaptive re-use of amenities and areas, and will enhance community activity and vibrancy.
Architectural Considerations and Requirements – Multi-Family Development shall be subject to the considerations and requirements contained in RZC 10-14-11 A (Building Design Standards) generally. In order to further promote the improvement and stabilization of housing stock, and to ensure quality new residential development in the City, Multi-Family Developments are also required to adhere to the following standards for architectural consideration:
Mix of Housing Types. Development must include a mix of housing types and styles.
Roofline Variations. Development must provide variations in rooflines, including alternating overall heights, pitches, orientations, as well as the addition of gables, hips, or dormers to provide interest and visual relief.
Structural Variation (Staggering). Units within buildings must be structurally staggered to provide additional relief.
Unit Entries. Development must provide a variety of entry styles and sizes to add visual interest and a sense of place to the pedestrian and street levels. For every 6 units, two distinct styles are required. No single building may include less than two (2) styles of entry.
Color & Materials. Development must provide for the use of a variety of colors and construction materials to provide visual interest. A material and color palette must be included with the proposal for approval.
Architectural Detail. All multi-family buildings and units shall have sufficient architectural detail, including but not limited to, significant fenestration at the street and upper levels, stonework, exposed beams and columns, cornices, moldings cast and sculpted features, courtyards, patios roof overhangs, bays and balconies, etc.

10-15-8 ADDITIONAL SITE STANDARDS AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS TO ESTABLISH A CONDITIONAL USE
To achieve the purposes of this Ordinance, Site and Building Design Standards or Design Guidelines are categorized as follows:

Site Standards related to buildings and structures including building design, location of buildings, access locations, parking and loading areas, landscaping treatments and buffer areas, signs and sign location, site and building lighting, and other features are required for all Site Plan Applications. Building Design Standards are required in addition to standards set forth in this Ordinance and are indicated by the verb “shall.”
Design Guidelines indicate additional actions that may be taken to enhance development design and achieve greater compatibility with adjacent land uses. Guidelines use the verb “should” (rather than “shall”) signifying that the guidelines are desirable objectives. Application of the guidelines will depend on the nature of the proposed Site Plan and the surrounding area, as may be determined by the Commission.
Building Design Standards:

All Site Plan Applications shall balance the proportion and scale of all proposed buildings and structures to the project site, adjacent buildings and structures, and streets from which the building will be accessed or viewed. Building plans, elevations and cross-section drawings, photographs, or other studies or models may be required to illustrate or fully explain how a proposed buildings and structures will address these issues.

It is the vision of the City that all buildings, and their associated facilities and improvements, will enhance the built environment of the City. To achieve this goal and to preserve and increase property values all Site Plan shall incorporate the following building design elements:
