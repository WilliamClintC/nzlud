PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Farmers Branch, Texas. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented through May 3, 1976, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and William Eddy and Robert MacNaughton, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Linda Tidwell-Groomer, Assistant City Manager, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

In the event of any irreconcilable conflict between the other provisions of this article and the provisions of the Ethics Handbook, the other provisions of this article shall control. 
I. City of Farmers Branch Ethics Policy 
IT IS THE POLICY of the City of Farmers Branch to uphold, promote and demand the highest standards of ethics from all of its officials, whether elected to City Council or appointed to advisory boards. Accordingly, the City Council, pursuant to Section 2.02 of the City Charter, has enacted a Code of Ethics ("the Code of Ethics") applicable to the City Council and all members of City boards, commissions, committees ("elected officials and advisory board members") in order to better ensure that all City officials maintain the utmost standards of personal integrity, truthfulness, honesty, and fairness in carrying out their public duties, avoid any improprieties in their roles as public servants, comply with all applicable laws, and never use their City position or powers improperly or for personal gain. One of the City's guiding principles is "doing the right things for the right reasons delivers appropriate results." The pursuit of transparency and accountability wherever possible helps achieve this principle and illustrates the City's commitment to good government and high ethical standards. 
The City of Farmers Branch and its elected officials and advisory board members all share a commitment to ethical conduct in service to their community. This handbook has been created to ensure that all elected and appointed officials and advisory board members have clear guidance for carrying out their responsibilities. 
II. Applicable Laws and Policies 
A. General Character 
Elected officials and advisory board members are often called upon to make decisions that affect various groups and individuals adversely. Balancing diverse constituent interests is a difficult task. While someone will always be disappointed in decisions, officials shall adhere to ethical standards that eliminate disappointment borne of dishonesty, conflicts of interest, unfairness or illegality. Preservation of public trust is critical for the preservation of democracy. 
A certain amount of detail is required in any code of ethics so that it serves as a clear guide. However, at the core of ethical behavior are some basic standards that officials shall use to reach a level of conduct that strives to be beyond reproach. Treating others as you would have them treat you is always a good ethical test. Another standard is to reflect on how your actions or decisions might be viewed by persons you or the public holds in high regard because of their ethical integrity. 
1. Honesty and Integrity. 
Honesty and integrity shall be the primary values in all issues. The public trust in the City Council and citizen boards can be a reality only when public officials are truthful. 
2. Fairness and Respect. 
All issues and citizens shall be handled with fairness, impartiality and respect. Elected officials and advisory board members have an obligation to treat all citizens fairly, such as by dividing time reasonably among potential speakers on an issue at a public hearing or meeting. In reviewing, discussing and deciding issues, City Councilmembers and citizen advisory board members have an obligation to be accessible, open and direct, not only with the other members of the City Council or board, but also to the citizens and business representatives who appear before them. The public is entitled to communicate with their public servants and understand the position of the City Council and boards on public issues. 
3. Effort. 
Elected officials and advisory board members have an obligation to attend meetings and to be prepared. It is expected that these officials will review the materials, participate in discussions and make an informed decision on the merits of the issue. 
B. Conflict of Interest 
Elected officials and advisory board members must be constantly on guard against conflicts of interest. In short, elected officials and advisory board members shall not be involved in any activity which conflicts with their responsibilities to the City and its residents. Citizens of Farmers Branch have a right to expect independence and fairness toward all groups without favoring individuals or personal interests. 
1. Self-Dealing and Financial Disclosure. 
Texas conflict-of-interest laws, in particular the provisions of Chapter 171 of the Texas Local Government Code ("Chapter 171"), apply to members of the City Council and other City officers, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The Code of Ethics incorporates many of the provisions of Chapter 171 and applies them to the members of the City's boards and commissions. As a result, every Councilmember and board and commission member must be consistently aware of any potential issues which may appear to be self-dealing. Officials must not be involved in discussing or deciding any issue over which they have jurisdiction as a City Council or board member which may impact the member, or the member's family, financially. 
The Code of Ethics provides that a City officer (which, for purpose of the Code of Ethics includes Councilmembers and City board and commission members) shall not participate in a vote or decision on any matter in which the officer has a "substantial interest." An officer has a "substantial interest" in the matter if the matter involves a business entity in which the officer: 
 owns 10% or more of the voting stock or shares of the entity 
 owns 10%, or $15,000, of the fair market value of the entity 
 10% of the officer's gross income for the prior year consisted of funds received from the entity; 
and the action will not have a special economic affect on the entity distinguishable from the public. 
As it relates to real property, an officer has a substantial interest in the matter if the officer owns an equitable or legal interest in the property with a fair market value of $2,500 or more and it is reasonably foreseeable that the matter will have a special economic affect on the value of the real property distinguishable from its affect on the public. For example, in a case involving the zoning of a property, if the officer owns property within 200 of the property being rezoned and receives a public hearing notice regarding that case, it will be presumed the officer's property will be affected in a manner distinguishable from other property in the City. 
The conflict of interest rules also apply to interests a City official's relatives own in a business entity or real estate. Be aware that while Chapter 171 applies only to relatives in the "first degree of consanguinity or affinity" (i.e., parents, spouse, or child), the Code of Ethics extends the rules to also include the officer's relatives within the "second degree of consanguinity or affinity" (i.e., step-children, father or mother-in-law, son or daughter-in-law, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers, and sisters). This is stricter than state law. 
Prior to any meeting where a matter in which the City officer has a conflict of interest under Chapter 171 or the Code of Ethics, Councilmembers and board and commission members must file a conflict-of-interest affidavit with the City Secretary or the board/commission staff liaison, and then refrain from participating in any part of the meeting where the matter at issue will be discussed. This means the member cannot discuss, let alone vote, on the matter. Because any form of communication from the officer, including, but not limited to, emails, text messages, hand gestures, applause, frowns and smiles, etc., might be perceived as the officer's attempt to improperly participate in the discussion of the matter for which a conflicts affidavit has been filed, it is recommended that the officer remove himself from the meeting room during the consideration of the matter. 
2. Disclosure of and Policy on Acceptance of Gifts and Favors and Relationships with Vendors. 
Chapter 176 of the Texas Local Government Code ("Chapter 176") in general requires disclosure by elected officials and members of certain quasi-judicial boards when receiving items of value or any compensation other than their normal salary for any service rendered in connection with that person's duties with the City. The Chapter 176 disclosure requirements may under certain circumstances apply to members of other boards and commissions if as a board or commission member the person acts as an agent of the City by exercising discretion in the planning, recommending, selecting, or contracting of a vendor. 
A conflict-of-interest statement as outlined in Chapter 176 of the Texas Local Government Code must be filed by a City Councilmember or other City officer if the aggregate value of all gifts received by the officer or member of the officer's family from the same vendor exceeds $100 in the twelve months preceding the City entering a contract with the vendor or considers entering a contract with the vendor. For purposes of this disclosure, a "gift" does not include (a) a political contribution; (b) food accepted as a guest; or (c) if the gift is offered on account of kinship or a personal, professional, or business relationship independent of the official status of the recipient. A "gift" would include transportation, lodging, and entertainment, even as a guest. 
Similarly, a Chapter 176 disclosure must be made by a Councilmember or other City officer if the officer or the officer's family member has an employment or other business relationship with the vendor which results in the officer or officer's family member receiving taxable income of more than $2,500 in the twelve months preceding the City entering a contract with the vendor or considers entering a contract with the vendor. The disclosure requirement does not apply if the officer only receives investment income, regardless of amount. 
In addition, a Chapter 176 disclosure is required if the Councilmember or other City officer has a family relationship with the vendor. For purposes of this disclosure, a "family relationship" means a person related (i) within the third degree by blood (e.g. mother, father, son, daughter, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, grandson, granddaughter, great-grandfather, great-grandmother, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, great-grandson and great-granddaughter) or (ii) with the second degree by marriage (e.g. spouse, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepchild, sister-in-law (brother's spouse or spouse's sister), brother-in-law (sister's spouse or spouse's brother), spouse's grandmother, spouse's grandfather, spouse's granddaughter, and spouse's grandson. 
This statement (Form CIS) must be filed with the City Secretary not later than seven (7) days after the Councilmember or other City officer learns of the basis for being required to file the disclosure. The disclosure must also be posted on the City's website. Vendors of the City have a similar disclosure requirement (Form CIQ) if they have a business affiliation or relationship with a local government official. Political contributions are exempt from these requirements and are addressed in Title 15 of the Texas Election Code. 
While Chapter 176 may not require members of all boards and commissions to file the statutory disclosure, the Code of Ethics requires all board and commission members to annually file a statement professing compliance with the Code of Ethics. This would include Section 2-279 of the Code of Ethics which prohibits an officer of the City from having a direct or indirect financial interest in contracts with the City. 
Under no circumstances shall a City Council or board member accept a gift or favor that is a bribe, or reflects, to a reasonable person, an effort to improperly influence the member contrary to that member's responsibility to the public to act impartially and on the merits of a matter. City Council and board members are expressly prohibited from participating in vendor reward programs that provide cash or gifts to the member based on City purchases provided however that the City Council or board member may accept frequent flyer miles car rental or lodging reward points accumulated by the City Council or board member for City sponsored or reimbursed travel expenses for official City business. Additionally, the Farmers Branch City Charter (Section 9.01) specifically prohibits the acceptance of any gift, favor, privilege, or employment from any franchised public utility of the City. The prohibition against receiving gifts does not apply to items of de minimis value and other identified categories of gifts listed in Section 2-279(d) of the Code of Ethics. When in doubt about these requirements, elected officials and advisory board members shall disclose the gift, benefit or favor. 
All disclosures will be kept for public record in the City Secretary's Office. 
Gifts having a value greater than $50 that are donated to the City or a bona fide charity also do not need to be reported. 
Gifts exceeding $50 in value and intended for the City rather than as a personal gift to a Councilmember or board member are not prohibited provided such items are timely delivered to the City's possession and become City property. Unreasonably delayed delivery of the gift to the City may subject the person to accusations that the person is making personal use of public property. 
3. Loyalty. 
Elected officials and advisory board members have an obligation to put the interests of the City of Farmers Branch over all personal considerations. Their goal should be "what is in the best interest for the broadest public good of the City of Farmers Branch, consistent with constitutional and other legal protections for property and other interests." 
4. Nepotism. 
As provided in the City Charter and Personnel Rules, no relative of a sitting Councilmember may be hired by the City, and no relative of a sitting advisory board member may be hired in the City department for which that advisory board member provides guidance. For a listing of relatives that are subject to this prohibition, refer to Section 9.16 of the City Charter. 
5. Purchase of City Property. 
No Councilmember or advisory board member shall purchase any personal property or real estate from the City regardless of the method of purchase excluding electronic computer tablet devices which have been issued to Councilmembers or advisory board members to be used as a resource during public meetings and for public email communications. These devices may be purchased by the user for fair market price at the end of a Councilmember's or advisory board member's term of office. 
6. Subsequent Appointments and Contracts. 
No Councilmember shall be appointed as an advisory board member within six months after the end of the Councilmember's term of office. No Councilmember or advisory board member, or a business entity in which the Councilmember or advisory board member has a substantial interest, shall be approved by Council to enter into a contractual purchase agreement with the City for a period of six months after the end of the person's term of office. 
C. Legal Compliance 
1. Meetings. 
Public Access: Open Meetings and Public Records 
Subject to certain exceptions, discussion of issues which may appear before the City Council or an appointed board are prohibited when a quorum of the members of the City Council or board is present. The Texas Open Meetings Act requires that the deliberations of its elected and, in some cases, appointed governing bodies be open to the public and that proper notice of such meetings be posted and made available to the public not later than 72 hours in advance of the meeting. Attempts by a quorum of the deliberating body to meet and discuss City business without fully complying with the Open Meetings Act is a criminal violation and can also be the basis for a charge of official misconduct pursuant to Section 9.18 of the City Charter. By local policy, all City boards and commissions, not just the City Council and other boards with quasi-judicial authority (e.g. Planning and Zoning Commission and Building Board of Adjustment), must comply with the Open Meetings Act. 
Similarly, though subject to certain exceptions, the City is required to make available to the public upon written request "public information" pursuant to the Public Information Act. "Public information" is information which is written, produced, collected, assembled, or maintained under a law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by a governmental body or by a third party on behalf of a governmental body. 
Public information can also include emails, text messages, blog and social media pages, and other types of electronic media discussing City matters. Written and electronic communications by Councilmembers or board and commission members relating to City business are often subject to disclosure to the public pursuant to a written request, whether such information is contained on a City-provided device or a personally owned device. Failure of a Councilmember or board or commission member to provide to the City Secretary copies of public information in their possession when a proper request for public information is received could (1) create a presumption that information that would otherwise by confidential to be public information and (2) result in the unlawful withholding of public information from the requesting party. Besides being a violation of the Public Information Act, any such lack of cooperation is likely to be considered contrary to the interest of the City and subject to sanctions under the Code of Ethics. 
2. Attendance. 
Attendance is outlined by the City Charter and is enumerated below: 
a. Mayor and City Council 
The City Charter provides that four (4) councilmembers may discipline another councilmember if the Councilmember misses three (3) regular (or 25% of the regular meetings in any six-month period) duly noticed meetings of the City Council without good cause. Duly noticed meetings of the City Council include regular council meetings, special council meetings, study sessions, policy sessions, executive sessions, budget review meetings, and council committee meetings to which a councilmember is assigned. 
The City Council generally finds that personal illness, family emergencies, military absences, family weddings, family graduation exercises, and bona fide business and vacation trips constitute good cause for nonattendance at council meetings. Whether good cause exists for any other absence shall be determined by vote of the entire City Council at the next regular meeting following the absence. The vote shall be taken after sufficient information is received explaining the reason for the councilmember's absence. 
b. Boards, Commissions and Committees 
The City's attendance policy for members of boards, commissions and committees provides that if a member fails to attend three (3) consecutive and duly noticed meetings of such groups without being excused for good cause, the City Council may declare the seat vacant and appoint a replacement. 
Members of City boards, commissions and committees are expected to attend all regularly scheduled meetings and should make every effort to do so. The City Council appoints members for their experience, background and perspective in a particular policy area, and desires the benefit of knowledgeable consideration and judgment. Moreover, boards, commissions and committees cannot conduct any business unless a quorum is present. Members should notify the chairperson of the board or the staff liaison regarding any meeting missed or to be missed. 
The advisory board, commission or committee shall decide by vote of the entire body at the next regular meeting following the absence, whether the absence was for good cause or not. Advisory boards, commissions and committees shall use the same standard for good cause as set forth above for councilmembers. 
3. Disclosure of Confidential Information. 
Texas law provides that, during a person's service with the City, no member of a City board, commission, committee or the City Council may disclose or use confidential information without appropriate authorization. The information is outlined in the Texas Open Meetings Act (Texas Government Code Chapter 551). For example, confidential information includes discussions during executive sessions and certain economic development information such as prospect leads. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information to the public is a Class B misdemeanor. 
Likewise, disclosure of public information which is confidential, such as emails or memos consisting of attorney-client communications, documents relating to proposed real estate purchases or sales, or documents relating to pending litigation, is a potential violation of the Public Information Act. 
4. Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Harassment. 
Public decision-making must be fair and impartial and shall not be discriminatory. 
The City of Farmers Branch is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate in its employment practice on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, military or veteran status, citizenship, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law, both internally and in the relationships of the elected officials and advisory board members with their constituencies. 
In addition, it is the policy of the City of Farmers Branch that the elected officials and advisory board members strive to create an operating environment internally and in the relationships of the elected officials and advisory board members with their constituencies, that is productive and free from intimidation, hostility or other adversity. Harassment of any sort - verbal, physical, visual - including intentional and unwarranted actions that would constitute sexual harassment were they to occur in an employment relationship, by any elected official or advisory board member, is prohibited and is considered a violation of the Code of Ethics. 
D. Political Activities 
Elected officials and advisory board members shall not use their political or appointed office to advance private interests. City Charter Section 2.02 prohibits the Mayor, Councilmembers, and board members from holding other public offices. 
Elected officials, advisory board members and candidates shall not engage in political campaigning at City meetings or within City buildings. They shall also not use public resources for political campaigning. For example, candidates or supporters of candidates shall refrain from circulating petitions during a City meeting and refrain from soliciting City employees to support their specific cause. City Council and board members are free to express their opinions about the public issues on the agenda before them, but they must not make campaign speeches at council or board meetings touting their, or another's, candidacy nor may they urge residents to vote for them or another, through words, signs, buttons or other means, during duly noticed meetings of the City Council or its citizen advisory boards. 
City Councilmembers shall not solicit, request or encourage employees while on duty to engage in political activities. 
E. Facilities, Resources and Expenses 
1. Expense Reports and Travel. 
When traveling on City business, elected officials shall conduct themselves professionally as representatives of the City of Farmers Branch. Officials are entitled to be reimbursed for actual and necessary travel expenses. Expenses must be documented completely and accurately and approved by a committee of Councilmembers designated for that purpose. Officials are asked to contact the appropriate City staff for assistance in travel plans and expense reports. 
2. Use of Equipment and Facilities. 
Elected officials and advisory board members shall not use City equipment or City facilities for private purposes, except to the same extent that they are available to the public. 
a. Software Management. 
Elected officials and advisory board members shall not make, use, accept or install illegal copies of computer software, documentation or templates. The City conducts periodic audits to ensure compliance with City policies on software installed on City-owned computers. 
The legality of software is ideally established by possession or accountability of the following five items: the original software diskettes, the license, the original manuals, documented evidence of purchase, or copy of the completed product registration. 
b. Electronic Mail. 
City-assigned electronic mail accounts shall be used only for City business or for minor personal use such as setting up medical appointments or communicating occasionally with one's family in a way that does not interfere with City business. City-assigned electronic mail accounts may not be used for personal business or for any campaign purpose. 
All City-assigned electronic mail is considered official City business and must be retained in accordance with the City's records management program. In general, electronic mail communications are public records and subject to disclosure under the public records laws. The Texas Public Information Act is found in Texas Government Code, Chapter 552. Because the Public Information Act has been expanded to include public information retained on private electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones, Councilmembers should do their utmost to only use their office City e-mail address when corresponding with the public or City staff about City business. 
3. Use of Staff. 
Under the council-manager form of government, the City Council appoints a City Manager, who directs the day-to-day operations of all employees. Councilmembers need to be sensitive to the role of the City Manager and City staff. In regard to administrative and executive duties under the City Manager, City Charter Section 2.10 requires the City Council to deal solely through the City Manager and expressly prohibits members of the City Council from privately or publicly giving any orders to City employees who are subordinates of the City Manager. 
Councilmembers may ask other staff members about the status of a matter and may ask for information, but Councilmembers shall not expressly or implicitly give orders or direction to staff, except through their participation on the City Council. They shall not try privately to influence the decisions or recommendations of staff members, but they may share information with staff. City Council and board members shall not intervene directly with staff on behalf of a particular constituent or organization on a pending matter, but shall participate with City Council or board colleagues in discussing and deciding policy matters for staff to carry out. 
Appointed board members shall work through the staff liaisons of their board. 
III. Procedures 
A. Where to Seek Advice 
Questions about this handbook, the City's Code of Ethics, a conflict-of-interest, compliance with open government laws, or other ethical issues should be presented to the City Attorney's Office. If time permits, requests should be in writing to the City Attorney directly. 
B. What to Do if You Are Uncertain 
The existence of an ethical issue often does not arise until a meeting is underway. Rather than risk an inadvertent violation of law, the safest course of action is simply to declare that a conflict may exists that prevents an elected official or advisory board member from participating. Indeed, if there is a consistent theme to this handbook, it would be: "If in doubt, don't." 
C. How to Declare a Possible Conflict 
If an official believes that a conflict-of-interest (or even a possible conflict) exists, then he or she should disclose the fact as soon as possible. For example, as soon as an elected official or advisory board member realizes that a conflict exists on a given matter, they must disclose the conflicting interest on the record for the minutes. From that point on, the official shall complete any required affidavit and not participate in any manner (by discussing, questioning or voting) in that matter. 
Declaring a conflict and not participating should be recognized as a necessary part of preserving public trust and should not be avoided simply because of delays or inconvenience. Indeed, officials should declare possible conflicts to avoid any appearance of impropriety. 
D. Where to Report Improper Behavior 
Elected officials and advisory board members have a duty to create the image and reality of a responsive, accessible and fair city government. Accordingly, City Council and advisory board members have a duty to report if another elected official or advisory board member is violating laws or ethics relating to city government, as set forth in the Code of Ethics and this handbook. Moreover, officials shall never attempt to use their authority or influence for the purpose of intimidating, threatening, coercing, commanding or influencing any person with the intent of interfering with that person's duty to disclose such improper activity. 
All complaints or allegations of a violation of the City's Code of Ethics against an elected official or advisory board member shall be made in writing on a form provided by the City, sworn to before a notary public, and filed of record with the City Secretary. A general complaint lacking in detail shall not be sufficient to merit investigation procedures outlined in the City's Code of Ethics Ordinance. 
IV. Penalties and Sanctions 
It is the intent of the City Council to educate, and, when necessary, discipline board or councilmembers who violate the City's Code of Ethics. Discipline shall be progressive, from the least punitive to the most punitive measures, unless the City Council believes progressive discipline does not provide the appropriate sanction because of the gravity of the offense, or because the City Council does not believe the sanction would deter future misconduct. In all instances, the totality of the circumstances shall be taken into consideration in resolving a matter, including the intent of the one accused of wrongdoing. This Code does not prevent informal resolution of minor infractions, such as by immediate corrective action of the possible misconduct. 
( Ord. No. 3479 , § 1, 1-23-2018)  
Sec. 2-281. - Disclosure of substantial interest. 
Any officer who has a substantial interest in any matter pending before the body, board, commission, corporation or committee of which the officer is a member, before a vote or decision on such matter, shall file an affidavit stating the nature and extent of the substantial interest, and shall abstain from further participation in such matter. The affidavit shall be on a form provided by the city and must be filed with the city secretary. 
( Ord. No. 3479 , § 1, 1-23-2018)  
Sec. 2-282. - Annual certification of compliance; sexual harassment training. 
(a)  Officers shall provide a written certification of compliance with this code of ethics, on a form provided by the city, upon taking office to the position appointed or elected, and on each anniversary date thereafter. 
(b)  Officers shall be required on annual basis to participate in sexual harassment training provided by the city. 
( Ord. No. 3479 , § 1, 1-23-2018)  
Sec. 2-283. - Post service prohibitions. 
(a)  The city may not appoint any former mayor or member of the city council to any appointed position (compensated or not) with the city or to any city board, commission or committee established by ordinance, resolution, charter, state law or otherwise until at least six months has elapsed since the such person terminated the office previously held by such person. 
(b)  The city may not enter into any contract for the purchase or sale of real or personal property, labor or services with any former officer or business entity in which the former officer has a substantial interest until at least six months has elapsed since such person terminated the position or office previously held by such person. 
( Ord. No. 3479 , § 1, 1-23-2018)  
Sec. 2-284. - Complaints against officers. 
(a)  All complaints or allegations of a violation of this code of ethics against an officer shall be made in writing sworn to before a notary public, and filed of record with the city secretary. The complainant may but is not required to use a form provided by the city. Such complaint shall describe in detail the act or acts complained of and the specific section(s) of this code of ethics alleged to have been violated. As determined by the city attorney a general complaint lacking in detail shall not be sufficient to invoke the investigation procedures contained herein; and anonymous complaints shall not be considered. Not later than the first business day after receipt the of the complaint by the city secretary, the city secretary shall provide a copy of the complaint to the affected officer, the city council, and the city attorney, who shall initially review the complaint to determine if the complaint contains sufficient detail and alleges a violation of the code of ethics. The affected officer may file a written response to the complaint with the city secretary within three business days after receipt of the complaint from the city secretary, who shall forward the response, if any, to the city attorney. 
(b)  Within three business days after notification by the city secretary, the mayor or mayor pro tem shall schedule a special called meeting of the city council to consider the complaint in executive session. At such meeting, the city attorney shall present a written report to the council describing in detail the nature of the complaint and the city attorney's findings and conclusions as to a possible violation of this Code. The non-implicated council members in attendance shall then review the complaint and either reject the complaint or invoke an investigation. In the event the city council decides to reject the complaint, the vote to reject the complaint shall be taken in open session without further investigation. In the event the city council decides to invoke an investigation, the city attorney shall select and appoint an independent private attorney to fully investigate the alleged improprieties. The investigating attorney shall report back to the council in writing within ten business days from such appointment, unless an extension is granted by a majority of the non-implicated council members. Such report shall be comprehensive and explain in detail all facts, findings, and conclusions in support of the attorney's opinion as to whether or not a violation of this code of conduct occurred. 
(c)  The city council shall consider the findings of the investigating attorney's report at the meeting in which it is presented, at which time the person(s) accused shall have the right to a full and complete hearing with the opportunity to call witnesses and present evidence on such person's behalf. The final action, decision, or vote of the council with regard to the complaint shall be taken or made only in a meeting that is open to the public. 
(d)  No action or decision with regard to the complaint shall be made except in a meeting which is open to the public. 
(e)  A complaint or allegation of a violation of this article may only be made against an officer while such person holds such position or office. A complaint made against an officer pursuant to this section shall be processed and resolved even if such person resigns from, or ceases to hold such position or office, prior to resolution of the complaint. 
( Ord. No. 3479 , § 1, 1-23-2018)  
Sec. 2-285. - Violations. 
The city council may take any one or more of the following actions in an open meeting concerning a complaint: 
(1)  Issue a statement finding the complaint is totally without merit, brought for the purpose of harassment, or brought in bad faith. 
(2)  Issue a letter of notification when the violation is unintentional. A letter of notification shall advise the officer of any steps to be taken to avoid future violations. 
(3)  Issue a letter of admonition when the violation is minor or may have been unintentional, but calls for a more substantial response than a letter of notification. 
(4)  Issue a reprimand when a violation has been committed knowingly or intentionally. 
(5)  Remove from office an officer, other than a city council member, for a serious or repeated violation of this code of ethics. Removal shall be, to the extent by and allowed, in compliance with the charter and state law. 
(6)  Pass a resolution of censure or a recommendation of recall when the city council finds that a serious or repeated violation of this code of ethics has been committed intentionally by a member of the city council. 
(7)  Removal of the mayor or member of the city council in accordance with applicable state law and the charter. Section 2.02 of the City Charter provides that a member of the city council may be removed from office if they knowingly violate the city council code of ethics. 
( Ord. No. 3479 , § 1, 1-23-2018)  
Sec. 2-286. - Interpretation of content. 
Any officer may request and the city attorney shall issue, a verbal or written opinion (as deemed appropriate) concerning the meaning or effect of any section, word, or requirement of this code of ethics as it affects such person.

If the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conforms to the requirements of this Code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and the fees specified have been paid, the Building Official shall issue a permit therefore to the applicant. 
When the Building Official issues the permit where plans are required, he shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications "APPROVED". Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorizations from the Building Official, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. 
The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of part of an electrical system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole system have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this Code.

(I)  Validity of Permit. The issuance of a permit or approval of plans and specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this Code, or of any other ordinance of the City, nor shall the issuance of a permit or approval of plans be construed as representing or warranting the safety or lack of defects of any electrical work described therein. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of these Codes shall be valid. 
The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications and other data shall not prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, specifications and other data, or from preventing building operations being carried on there under when in violation of these Codes or of any other ordinances of the City. 
(J)  Expiration. Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provisions of this Code shall expire by limitation and become null and void, if the building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the building or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days or more. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained and the fee therefore shall be one-half the amount required for the original permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work; and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after one year, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. 
Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which he may commence work under that permit when he is unable to commence work within the time required by this article for good and satisfactory reasons. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days upon written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from being taken. No permit shall be extended more than once. 
(K)  Suspension or Revocation. The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this Code whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation of the City.

(D)  Other Inspections. In addition to the inspections required by this Code, the Building Official may make or require other inspections of any work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Code and other laws which are enforced by the Code enforcement agency. 
(E)  Reinspection. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is requested is not complete or when required corrections are not made. 
This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection or when required corrections are not made. 
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. 
To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee in accordance with The Fee Schedules of the City of Farmers Branch. 
In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

"Initial Testing" shall consist of the 3rd party testing contractor performing the required tests on at least three consecutive dwelling units. Test results from the "Initial Testing" must satisfy minimum code requirements before sampling is permitted. Dwelling units selected for the "Initial Testing" must be within the same building. Dwelling units selected for "Initial Testing" shall not be included in a "sample group" or counted toward the minimum 15% of dwelling units tested. The building official shall randomly select the three dwelling units for "Initial Testing." The building official may delegate the random selection to the designated 3rd party testing contractor. 
R402.4.1.5.1 Sample group Identification and Sampling. The builder shall identify a "sample group" which may be a building, floor, fire area or portion thereof. All of the dwelling units within the "sample group" must be at the same stage of construction and must be ready for testing. The building official shall randomly select at least 15% of dwelling units from each "sample group" for testing. The building official may delegate the random selection to the designated 3rd party testing contractor. 
If each tested dwelling unit within a "sample group" meets the minimum code requirements, then all dwelling units in the "sample group" are considered to meet the minimum code requirements. 
Before a building may be deemed compliant with the testing as required, each "sample group" must be deemed compliant with the minimum code requirements. The sum total of all of the tested dwelling units across all "sample groups" shall not be less than a minimum of 15% of the dwelling units in a building. 
R402.4.1.5.2 Failure to Meet Code Requirement(s). If any dwelling units within the identified "sample group" fail to meet a code requirement as determined by testing, the builder will be directed to correct the cause(s) of failure, and 30% of the remaining dwelling units in the "sample group" will be randomly selected for testing by the building official, or third-party testing contractor, regarding the specific cause(s) of failure. 
If any failures occur in the additional dwelling units, all remaining dwelling units in the sample group must be individually tested for code compliance. 
A multifamily property with three failures within a 90-day period is no longer eligible to use the sampling protocol in that community or project until successfully repeating "Initial Testing." Sampling may be reinstated after at least three consecutive dwelling units are individually verified to meet all code requirements. 
A Certificate of Occupancy may not be issued for any building until testing has been performed and deemed to satisfy the minimum code requirements on the dwelling unit(s) identified for testing. 
Section R403.3.3 is amended by adding the following at the end of the section: 
Mandatory testing shall only be performed by individuals that are certified to perform duct testing leakage testing certified by national or state organizations as approved by the building official.

(c)  Any costs incurred by the city in performing work under this article may be enforced in accordance with subsection (e) of this section and through any other remedies provided by city ordinance or state law. 
(d)  Assessment of civil penalties. 
(1)  If the city attorney or the building official determines that the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee of a structure has not timely complied with a municipal court order issued under section 22-464, the city attorney may file an action in municipal court for the assessment of a civil penalty against the property. The city attorney or the building official shall promptly give notice to each owner, lienholder, and mortgagee of the hearing to assess a civil penalty. The notice must include: 
a.  An identification, which is not required to be a legal description, of the structure and the property on which it is located; 
b.  An identification of the court order affecting the property;

(4)  The court, after hearing evidence from each interested person present, may assess a civil penalty against the owner in a specific amount in accordance with section 22-460(b)(7) of this article. 
(5)  Notice of a court order issued under this subsection must comply with the requirements and procedures of section 22-464(f) and (g) and section 22-469 for notice of other board orders. 
(6)  A civil penalty assessed under this subsection may be enforced in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. 
(7)  A civil penalty assessment hearing may be combined with any other hearing before the municipal court concerning the same property. 
(e)  Liens. 
(1)  The expense of the repair, demolition, vacation, or securing of a structure or the relocation of the occupants of a structure, when performed under contract with the city or by city forces, and any civil penalty assessed against the owner of the structure, constitute a nontransferable lien against the real property on which the structure stands or stood and runs with the land, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution. The city's lien attaches when notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is located. The notice must contain the name and address of the owner, if reasonably determinable, a legal description of the real property, the amount of expenses incurred by the city, and the balance due. 
(2)  The city's lien for the expenses is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens, if each mortgagee and lienholder is given notice and an opportunity to repair, demolish, vacate, or secure the structure, or relocate the occupants of the structure, whichever applies. Otherwise, the city's lien for expenses, or for any civil penalties imposed, is superior to all other previously recorded judgment liens except for any previously recorded bona fide mortgage lien attached to the real property, if the mortgage lien was filed for record in the county clerk's office of the county in which the real property is located before the date the civil penalty was assessed or the action for which the expenses were incurred was begun by the city. 
(3)  A lien acquired by the city under this section for repair expenses may not be foreclosed if the structure upon which the repairs were made is occupied as a residential homestead by a person 65 years of age or older. 
(4)  The city may use lawful means to collect expenses and civil penalties assessed under this article from an owner. Any civil penalty or other assessment imposed under this article accrues interest at the rate of ten percent a year from the date of the assessment until paid in full. The city may petition a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil suit for a final judgment in accordance with the assessed civil penalty. To enforce the civil penalty, the city must file with the district clerk of a county in which the city is located a certified copy of the municipal court order assessing the civil penalty, stating the amount and duration of the penalty. The assessment of a civil penalty under this article is final and binding and constitutes prima facie evidence of the penalty. No other proof is required for the district court to enter final judgment on the penalty.

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 3477 , § 1, adopted Dec. 12, 2017, amended Art. VII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. VII, §§ 26-45026-459, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 3419, § 2, 2-21-2017. 
 
Sec. 26-450. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the occupants of apartment complexes and other citizens of the city by obtaining greater compliance with minimum property standards through the establishment of a mandatory crime reduction program for apartment complexes. Reducing the crime rate at an apartment complex is essential to making the apartment complex safe, sanitary, and fit for human use and habitation. 
( Ord. No. 3477 , § 1, 12-12-2017)  
Sec. 26-451. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Apartment complex means a multifamily property that contains ten or more dwelling units, which may be located in one or more buildings, that are leased or offered for lease and are not independently owned. 
Board means the City of Farmers Branch Zoning Board of Adjustment. 
Chief of police and/or chief means the chief of the police department of the city or the chiefs authorized representative. 
Crime means any and all incidents that occur at an apartment complex that cause a criminal offense or arrest report to be generated by the Farmers Branch Police Department. Crime shall include all applicable crimes occurring within the surrounding neighborhood that, through information or investigation, can be traced to the apartment complex premises. The term does not include non-applicable crimes. 
Non-applicable crimes means all offenses involving domestic violence; fraud; and buying, receiving, or possessing stolen property. Also non-applicable are offenses that result from transition onto an apartment complex from the street as a result of a traffic stop and status offenses (i.e., offenses that constitute criminal activity because of the age of the accused). 
Owner means a person claiming, or in whom is vested, the ownership, dominion or title of real property, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Holder of fee simple title; 
(2)  Holder of life estate; 
(3)  Holder of a leasehold estate for an initial term of five years or more;

Sec. 26-452. - Authority of chief of police. 
The chief of police, or his/her designee, shall implement and enforce the provisions under this article. 
( Ord. No. 3477 , § 1, 12-12-2017)  
Sec. 26-453. - Apartment complex crime index and crime risk/safety threshold. 
(a)  The chief of police will calculate the apartment community crime index on an annual basis. Apartment complex crime index will be calculated by dividing the total of Part I crimes (violent Part I crimes are weighted double) and Part II crimes in a specific apartment complex by the total number of units in the apartment complex and multiplying that number by 100, giving a ratio of crime per 100 units. 
(b)  The chief of police will calculate a residential crime index on an annual basis for single-family dwellings within the corporate limits of the city. The residential crime index will be calculated by dividing the total of Part I (violent Part I crimes are weighted double) and Part II crimes for all single-family residences by the total number of single-family residences in the city and multiplying that number by 100, giving a ratio of crime per 100 residences. 
(c)  The chief of police will calculate the crime risk/safety threshold on an annual basis. The crime risk/safety threshold is calculated by multiplying the residential crime index by 2.0. 
(d)  All crime index and crime risk/safety threshold numbers calculated in this article will be rounded to the nearest tenth (e.g., an index number of 10.25 would be rounded up to 10.3 and an index number of 10.24 would be rounded down to 10.2). 
( Ord. No. 3477 , § 1, 12-12-2017)  
Sec. 26-454. - Reserved.  
Sec. 26-455. - Mandatory crime reduction program; when required. 
(a)  An apartment complex must participate in the mandatory crime reduction program whenever the apartment complex's crime index exceeds the crime risk/safety threshold. Apartment complex crime index, residential crime index, and crime risk/safety threshold are calculated in accordance with formulas provided in section 26-453. 
(b)  An apartment complex that is required to participate in the mandatory crime reduction program shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Require all current and future tenants to sign a "crime free lease addendum"; 
(2)  Hold at least one crime watch meeting per quarter on premises in cooperation with the Farmers Branch Police Department; 
(3)  Conduct (at their own expense) a criminal background check on all future residents; 
(4)  Permit a minimum of two inspections of the apartment complex by the chief. The first inspection will evaluate what changes and improvements to the premises and operations are needed to help reduce crime at the apartment complex. The second inspection will be conducted for the purposes of determining whether the complex is in compliance with this article. 
(5)  Participate in the Farmers Branch Police Criminal Trespass Enforcement Program. An owner or manager of the apartment complex shall execute a trespass affidavit on a form provided by the chief for that purpose that authorizes the police department to enforce, on behalf of the apartment complex, all applicable trespass laws on the premises of the apartment complex.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 34-31. - Findings of fact. 
The city in the past has experienced soil erosion and sedimentation problems. Quantities of earth have been displaced by water action on public streets, sidewalks, alleys, easements, storm sewers, parks, ponds and lakes. Erosion is detrimental to water quality and clarity. Sedimentation accumulation restricts the flow of stormwater runoff in easements, storm sewers and gutters; it creates a hazard to pedestrians in sidewalks and streets; and it is a vehicular hazard in streets. These problems result in a serious threat to the health, safety and general welfare of the community. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. I, § A, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-32. - Purpose of article. 
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety and general welfare by establishing minimum performance standards, requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with accelerated soil erosion and resultant sedimentation. Minimizing soil erosion and off-site sedimentation will minimize damage to public and private property, and assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards. Further, it is the purpose of this article to: 
(1)  Protect human life, health and property; 
(2)  Reduce sedimentation in streams, creeks, lakes, waterways, storm drains, etc.; 
(3)  Minimize expenditures of public money for cleaning sediment out of streets, sidewalks, storm drains and watercourses; 
(4)  Preserve the natural beauty and aesthetics of the community; and 
(5)  Provide for restoration of sites to reduce the negative environmental impacts of construction activity. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. I, § B, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-33. - Scope of article. 
The provisions of this article apply to: 
(1)  Any person proposing to develop land or improve property within the city. 
(2)  Any person currently developing land or improving property within the city. 
(3)  Any person who owns, possesses, is in custody of or exercises control of property within the city. 
Such persons are collectively referred to as "owner." This article applies to building structures, subdivisions, excavations and fill operations, all development and all other similar development activities. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. I, § C, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-34. - Conflicting ordinances. 
Besides this article, the city has other ordinances, regulations and specifications possibly affecting erosion and sedimentation control. In the event of a conflict between this article and any other ordinances of the city, the most restrictive ordinance shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. I, § D, 12-7-1987)

Sec. 34-56. - Failing to prevent a public erosion nuisance. 
It shall be unlawful for any owner to fail to prevent a public erosion nuisance from occurring on such property. A public erosion nuisance is defined as a situation in which erosion of, or sediment from, one location is causing damage to a public right-of-way. Damage to the public right-of-way includes silt, mud or similar debris originating from one property but being deposited onto a second, off-site property, which is public property or a public right-of-way. The city may have to remove or clean up the deposit due to liability, statutory, aesthetic, drainage or property damage concerns. This article applies only to erosion and sedimentation that occurs upon public property and not private property. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. II, § B, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-57. - Variances. 
The city council may grant a written variance from the requirements of the standards and specifications of this article if strict adherence to its requirements will result in unnecessary hardship and not fulfill the intent of this article. The owner shall submit a written request for a variance to the city. The request shall state the specific variances sought and reasons for requesting the variances. The city shall not grant a variance unless and until sufficient specific reasons justifying the variance are provided by the owner. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. II, § C, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-58. - Notice. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the city engineer or his designee to give 48 hours' notice, in writing, to the owner or agent in charge of any premises believed to be in violation of this article, to correct the public erosion nuisance and to clean up and remove the offending and burdensome sedimentation. 
(b)  If the city engineer decides, in his judgment, that the situation believed to be in violation of this article poses a substantial and immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare of the city, the city engineer may give such notice as he deems is necessary and appropriate given the existing circumstances and conditions, even though such notice is given in less than 48 hours. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. II, § D, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-59. - Duties of city officials.

(1)  Inspecting sites to determine compliance with this article; 
(2)  Determining if sureties shall be exercised. If so, the city engineer shall arrange for the work to be done, and if not, the city engineer shall return the sureties to the applicant; and 
(3)  Determining if a stop work order shall be issued and, if so, when the stop work order shall be removed from the project or construction, and work allowed to commence or recommence. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. IV, § A, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-60. - Responsibilities of owners. 
The owner, builder, developer, tenant or any other person who owns, possesses, is in custody of or exercises control of property shall be responsible for any silt, mud or sands transported from the property by drainage. The intent of this article is that owners, builders and developers make provisions for preventing erosion and sedimentation problems at such time as their property is proposed for development, use or modification, and to continue such preventive measures during the actual construction and development of the property. Additionally, all persons who, after construction and development, own, possess, are in custody of or exercise control of the property are responsible for preventing the erosion and sedimentation problems addressed by this article.

Sec. 34-61. - Failure to comply with article; notice; abatement by city; assessment of costs; lien; interest; recovery of costs suit. 
If the owner of land situated within the corporate limits of the city shall fail to comply with this article, then the city engineer, or his designee, shall notify such owner by letter addressed to him at the address shown on the last approved tax rolls of the city, at any residence or business structure located on the subject property, or at the last known address. The mailing of notice in accordance with any of these premises shall satisfy this section. In the alternative, the city may notify the owner by publication in the city's official newspaper on one occasion. At the expiration of ten days after notification or publication, the city may enter upon such premises and may do such work as is necessary, or cause the work to be done, in order that the premises may comply with the requirements set forth within this article. A statement of the cost incurred by the city to abate such condition shall be mailed to the owner of the premises, which statement shall be paid within 30 days of the date of the mailing. If the statement has not been paid within such period, the city manager may file a statement with the county clerk of the expenses incurred to abate such condition on such premises, and the city shall have a privileged lien on any lot, tract or parcel of land upon which such expense is incurred, together with ten percent on the delinquent amount from the date such payment is due. For any such expenditure and interest, suit may be instituted and recovery and foreclosure had in the name of the city and the statement so made, or a copy thereof, shall be prima facie proof of the amount expended in any such work performed by the city. The city manager or his designee shall file a statement of expenses incurred, giving the amount of such expenses, the date on which the work was done, or the improvements made, with the county clerk. The city shall have a privileged lien on such lots or real estate upon which such work was done or improvements made to secure the expenditures so made, in accordance with the provisions of V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code § 342.001 et seq., which lien shall be second only to tax liens and liens for street improvements. Such amount shall bear ten percent interest from the date the statement was filed. Further, for any such expenditures and interest, suit may be instituted and recovery and foreclosure of the lien may be had in the name of the city, and the statement of expenses so made, or a certified copy thereof, shall be prima facie proof of the amount expended for such work or improvements.

DIVISION 3. - CONTROL MEASURES 
 
Sec. 34-81. - Applicability of this article to creeks. 
The applicability of this article to Cooks Creek, Rawhide Creek and Farmers Branch Creek is limited to the implementation of erosion control and/or sedimentation control methods for new development and redevelopment. As a requirement for platting or replatting of land along or contiguous to such creeks, all applicants shall submit to the city engineer for approval an erosion and sedimentation control plan prior to commencement of construction. The erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be included in the engineering construction plans. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. V, § A, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-82. - Erosion and sedimentation control plan. 
The objective of the erosion and sedimentation control plan is to prevent public erosion nuisances. The prevention of public erosion nuisances can be promoted, in part, by the following goals: 
(1)  Reduce sedimentation in streams, creeks, lakes, waterways, storm drains, etc. 
(2)  Protect the quality of the water in the city. 
(3)  Provide, protect and preserve wildlife habitats. 
(4)  Provide for restoration of sites to reduce the negative environmental impacts of construction activity. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. V, § B, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-83. - Methods of reducing erosion and sedimentation. 
(a)  Required design considerations. In order to implement the objectives stated in section 32-82, the following design considerations are necessary: 
(1)  Limit the size of disturbed areas to the greatest extent possible. 
(2)  Stabilize any disturbed area as soon as possible. 
(3)  For construction activities in waterways, the following additional requirements must be met: 
a.  At the end of each working day, the contractor shall remove all loose excavated material from the channel. 
b.  No construction or fill materials can be stored within the limits of the channel. All equipment and materials storage and staging areas must have erosion controls. 
c.  Rock berms or sand bag berms shall be used to entrap sediment. 
d.  Flooding potential should be considered when locating the control measures. 
(4)  Require controls to intercept silt from all disturbed areas. 
(5)  Keep the velocities of stormwater runoff below the erosive level. 
(6)  Protect street areas and areas disturbed by development activity from upstream runoff. 
(7)  Capture and filter/drain stormwater runoff. 
(8)  Minimize the extent of sediment leaving the project site. 
(9)  Reduce flooding hazards and silt removal cost associated with excessive sediment accumulation in storm drains and waterways. 
(10)  Reduce the concentration of stormwater runoff and promote street flow to the greatest extent possible. 
(11)  Revegetate all disturbed areas with a rapid, vigorous growth of longterm vegetation composed of a mixture of grasses, ferns and woody plants. 
(12)  Provide sedimentation and/or filtration pond to maintain and improve water quality. 
(13)  Erosion control plans should be phased to accommodate for changes in drainage patterns that occur during development. 
(14)  Reduce the silt leaving a construction site on the wheels of construction vehicles by providing vehicle washing areas and/or established construction entrances and exits. 
(15)  Preserve and protect existing vegetation to the greatest extent possible. 
(16)  Planning should consider the natural topography and soil condition in an attempt to limit the erosion potential. 
(17)  Design erosion and sedimentation controls to harmonize with the natural character of the land. 
(18)  When storm drain inlets must be protected, a perimeter filtration dike shall be used (triangular filtration dike or hay bale dike). 
(b)  Considerations of subsection (a) of this section illustrative, not exhaustive. The considerations listed in subsection (a) of this section are illustrative only, and are not to be considered an exhaustive list of criteria an effective erosion and sedimentation plan should address in order to prevent a public erosion nuisance. 
(c)  Applicant responsibility to prepare and submit plan. It shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant to prepare and submit an erosion and sedimentation control plan which meets the requirements of the city and this article. 
(d)  Other plan inclusions. The plan shall include sufficient information to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the effected areas, the potential impacts of the proposed grading on water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of measures proposed to minimize soil erosion and off-site sedimentation. The applicant shall certify on the drawings that all clearing, grading, drainage, construction and development shall be conducted in strict accordance with the plan. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. V, § C, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-84. - Effect of plan approval. 
(a)  It is to be understood that the approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan by the department of engineering does not constitute a recognition by the city that the erosion and sedimentation control plan will prevent any or all public erosion nuisances. By approval of the erosion and sedimentation control plan, the city does not warrant that the erosion and sedimentation control plan will be sufficient to prevent a public erosion nuisance, and the city waives no rights to pursue any legal remedies, both under this article, and all other applicable ordinances and laws. 
(b)  If for any reason, after an erosion and sedimentation control plan is approved by the department of engineering, a public erosion nuisance occurs on property addressed by the erosion and sedimentation control plan, the approval of the erosion and sedimentation control plan shall not be a defense or bar to prosecution under this article. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. V, § D, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-85. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The planning considerations given in this article for erosion controls rely on a degree of erosion and sedimentation control and flood protection that is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and that is based on scientific, engineering and economic considerations. This article does not imply that erosion and sedimentation controls will survive inundation by runoff from storms or that land below such controls will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city, or any officer or employee of the city, for any flood damages, or erosion or sedimentation damages, whether to persons or property, that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made under this article. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. V, § E, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-86. - Surety for permanent erosion controls in new subdivisions. 
(a)  The applicant shall provide a surety in the form of cash, certificate of deposit, surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit acceptable to the city to ensure that vegetative cover and other permanent erosion control measures are installed, maintained and functioning properly at the end of a two-year period from the date of final acceptance of the dedicated streets and/or utilities by the city. This surety shall be given to the city before the final acceptance of the streets and/or utilities. This surety shall be in the amount estimated by the developer, which is 100 percent of the cost of constructing and maintaining the permanent erosion controls for a two-year period. However, such estimate is subject to review by the city engineer and may be rejected, and the surety not accepted, if the city engineer deems the estimate not to be a reasonable approximation of the costs of constructing and maintaining the erosion controls. 
(b)  Should the vegetative cover die or become sparse or the erosion controls fail to be maintained or are not functioning during this two-year period, the city may notify the applicant in writing. The applicant has ten days after being notified to begin correcting the problems. If no corrections are started, the city may make the necessary repairs by exercising the surety or billing the applicant. If at the end of the two-year period the vegetative cover is still not established or is sparse, or the erosion controls are not functioning, the city may exercise the surety and have the erosion controls installed and established. 
(c)  The procedures in subsections (a) and (b) of this section for ensuring that vegetation is established shall apply to all projects, whether or not the vegetation is the longterm maintenance responsibility of the city. Any vegetative cover which is planted and is a permanent part of the improvement project will not be accepted by the city until the growth has been established and maintained by the developer for a two-year period from the date of final acceptance of the subdivision. 
(d)  After the two-year period has elapsed, the owner of the property shall be responsible for maintaining the erosion controls in good working order. If any future owner modifies or disturbs the erosion controls for the area, that owner must restore or replace the permanent erosion controls at the conclusion of the disturbing activity. 
(Ord. No. 1740, art. V, § F, 12-7-1987)  
Sec. 34-87. - Stop work orders. 
All development, improvement and construction on any land which is in violation of the provisions of this article may be halted and stopped by order of the city engineer. No stop work order may be issued until the notice provisions of this article are fully complied with by the city and the owner or agent of the premises is given a reasonable time period to correct the public erosion nuisance and to clean up and remove the offending and burdensome sedimentation.

The bond shall become effective on or before the date the gas well permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of 150 days after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs last. The operator shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and regulations of this article and the city. The original bond shall be submitted to the city manager or his designee with a copy of the same provided to the city secretary.

(F)  The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000.00 for any single well or $50,000.00 blanket for more than one well, but subject to minimum of $15,000.00 for each well drilled and/or placed into production. After three wells have been drilled, each additional drilled well will require an incremental bond of $15,000.00 per well in addition to the original $50,000.00 blanket bond. The aggregate amount of an operator's bond and/or letter of credit for all wells operated by that operator shall not be required to exceed $150,000.00. Provided, however, if at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the city council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of $250,000.00 per well.

The city shall be authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due to the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandoned the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this article. 
In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods. 
(H)  When the well or wells covered by said irrevocable letter of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, of upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled.

Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood with a one-foot increase in the water surface elevation. 
Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include longterm storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

a.  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
b.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred; or 
(2)  The improvement will increase the total area of a lot occupied by building by more than 20 percent. 
For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (i) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or (ii) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

Sec. 42-36. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purpose, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses and development that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage. 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

Sec. 42-41. - Removal of lands from areas of special flood hazard. 
(a)  The limits of an area of special flood hazard may be reduced if the potential for flood damage is reduced to the extent required by the city council and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other governing agencies. A change in limits shall be accomplished by the person desiring such change furnishing either: 
(1)  Engineering evidence that the property is not subject to flooding by the base flood; or 
(2)  Engineering plans and supportive hydrologic and hydraulic studies for improvements to change the limits of the area of special flood hazard. 
(b)  The information shall be furnished to the local administrator. When it has been determined by the local administrator that the flood hazard has been alleviated, the information shall be submitted concurrently to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies for review and/or approval. Upon receipt of the reviews and/or approval, the application will be forwarded to the city council for action. 
(c)  If both the Federal Emergency Management Agency and city council approve the information and plans furnished and the method of flood hazard alleviation, the limits of an area of special flood hazard may be revised as justified. Such change in limits shall occur after any required facilities have been provided in accordance with the approved plans. 
(Ord. No. 1172, art. 3, § G, 12-19-1977; Ord. No. 1670, art. 3, § G, 5-4-1987)  
Sec. 42-42. - Areas of controlled flood protection. 
(a)  The Farmers Branch-Carrollton Flood Control District shall be an area of controlled flood protection. If the flood hazard alleviation measures are not permanent in nature or if continuing maintenance and/or operating procedures are required to ensure that the occurrence of a base flood will not result in flooding, the land removed from an area of special flood hazard shall be designated as an area of controlled flood protection. The continuation of this designation shall be contingent upon the concurrence of the city council and FEMA that the flood hazard alleviation measures are maintained and/or operating procedures continued in such a manner that the occurrence of a base flood will not result in flooding. Fill permits for land so designated shall be issued during such time as flood hazard alleviation measures are determined by the local administrator to be adequate. Fill permits shall be forwarded to the Farmers Branch-Carrollton Flood Control District for review. The local administrator shall issue the fill permit after receipt of the flood control district review. The permit procedure will be the same as section 42-64(e). Adequacy shall be determined by the capability of the area of controlled flood protection being able to withstand the occurrence of a base flood without flooding occurring within the area of controlled flood protection. Streets shall have a minimum top of curb elevation of 429.00 (six-inch curb). 
(b)  The degree of control with respect to flooding by the city council and FEMA within such areas shall be commensurate with the probability of flooding occurring if such maintenance and/or operating procedures are not continued. Binding contracts or other enforceable assurances that the required flood hazard alleviation measures will be continuously capable of providing protection from flooding in accordance with standards acceptable to the city council and FEMA shall be required in such areas. Failure to comply with such standards shall result in the area of controlled flood protection being again designated as an area of special flood hazard. 
(c)  Special flood hazard areas protected from inflowing floodwaters by their total or partial enclosure by levees, canals, ditches, conduits, or similar drainage facilities shall remain as special flood hazard areas until facilities approved by the city council and FEMA have been provided which will remove any floodwaters which may accumulate in such enclosed area. The facilities provided to remove internal accumulations of floodwater shall be adequate to protect all of such enclosed area from flooding to the standards required by this article. Lands within such enclosed area necessary for canals, ditches, detention basins and similar open drainageways approved by the city council and FEMA shall be designated as floodways. All land within such enclosed areas may be designated as an area of controlled flood protection, with the exception of that designated as a floodway, upon the completion of all facilities required for the removal of internal accumulations of floodwaters and the protection from inflowing floodwaters in accordance with plans approved by the city council and FEMA. Fill permits shall not be issued for any part of such enclosed areas until the entire area so enclosed, with the exception of that designated as a floodway, has been designated as an area of controlled flood protection. Excavation, filling and/or grading operations in progress upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived may be continued without a fill permit unless the city engineer determines that: 
(1)  Such work, or binding contract for such work, was not initiated prior to December 19, 1977; 
(2)  Such work is not beneficial toward the development of the land to its highest and best use; or 
(3)  Such work endangers land to flooding which was not designated as a special flood hazard area on December 19, 1977. 
(d)  It is the intent of this article to provide for conditions which will permit the development and use of land to continue without threat of interruption after a special flood hazard area has been designated as an area of controlled flood protection. Adequate provision of these conditions requires that facilities for the detention of peak flows and the removal of floodwaters which may accumulate within areas totally or partially enclosed, as described in subsection (c) of this section, shall have adequate capacity to perform their required function under adverse conditions. The design capacity for such facilities shall be based upon the development of the entire area contributing flood flows to the facility under rainfall conditions which can be anticipated upon the occurrence of a base flood. The normal storage and/or discharge capacity of such facilities shall provide protection to developed land and structures and shall limit street inundation to the standards established by this article. In addition, the water surface elevation of the base flood shall not exceed the lowest floor elevation of any structure within an enclosed area, as previously described, if pumps are required for the discharge of accumulated flood flows and the largest single pump provided for that area is inoperative during the occurrence of the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 1172, art. 3, § H, 12-19-1977; Ord. No. 1670, art. 3, § H, 5-4-1987; Ord. No. 2014, § 1, 1-4-1993)  
Sec. 42-43. - Improvements within the area of special flood hazard. 
(a)  Improvements that are within the area of special flood hazard but do not alter the limits of the area of special flood hazard or that are in Zones AO and AH are subject to the same conditions and procedures of section 42-41 with one exception. 
(b)  Submittal to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies are not required if the local administrator determines that the improvement will not: 
(1)  Significantly change the existing topography; 
(2)  Affect the elevation and velocity of the base flood; and 
(3)  Change the floodway boundary. 
(Ord. No. 1172, art. 3, § I, 12-19-1977; Ord. No. 1670, art. 3, § I, 5-4-1987)  
Sec. 42-44. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Sec. 42-82. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 42-37, section 42-62(6), or section 42-84(c), the following provisions are required (when an area has been removed from an area of special flood hazard, only subsection (1) of this subsection shall apply): 
(1)  Residential and non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, and access facilities elevated to two feet (minimum) above the base flood elevation. Parking facilities shall be elevated to one (1) foot (minimum) above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer shall submit a certification to the City Engineer that the standard is satisfied. There shall be no more than one basement level. 
(2)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  No manufactured home shall be placed in a floodway. 
b.  All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Specific requirements shall be as follows: 
1.  Over-the-top ties at each of the four corners of the manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations and manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per side. 
2.  Frame ties at each corner of the home with five additional ties per side at intermediate points and manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring four additional ties per side. 
3.  All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds. 
4.  Any additions to the manufactured home be similarly anchored. 
c.  These manufactured home standards are applicable only to those which are presently permitted for use by caretakers and watchmen. 
d.  If other manufactured home uses are permitted in the future, applicable standards shall be adopted prior to such permitted use. 
e.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A and AH on the city's FIRM map shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home be three feet (minimum) above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provision of subsection (3)b. of this section. 
(4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-37 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  If subsection (4)a. of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
c.  Prohibit the placement of any manufactured homes.

Sec. 42-83. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard and controlled flood protection established in section 42-37 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of structures shall have the lowest floor elevated not less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade at least as one foot higher as the depth number specified on the community's FIRM if such structure is within a presently platted subdivision. Basements must be floodproofed a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation. There shall be no more than one basement level. 
(2)  No new structures, required parking for such structures or access to such structures, or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be permitted in AO zones of platted areas filed for record after December 19, 1977. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer shall submit certification to the city engineer that the standards of this section are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

Sec. 42-85. - Standards for improvements in areas of special flood hazard. 
Improvements to reduce the limits of the area of special flood hazard or within the area of special flood hazard, as referenced in sections 42-41 and 42-42, shall conform to the following criteria: 
(1)  Alterations of the area of special flood hazard may not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
(2)  Alterations of the area of special flood hazard may not create an erosive velocity on-site or off-site. The mean velocity of the stream downstream of the improvements may not exceed the velocity prior to the improvements. 
(3)  Alterations of the area of special flood hazard may be allowed only to the extent permitted by equal conveyance on both sides of the natural channel with separate owners. 
(4)  The toe of any fill slope must parallel the natural channel to maintain balanced streamflow in the altered special flood hazard area. 
(5)  An environmental impact study and complete stream rehabilitation program must be approved prior to any relocation of the natural creek. 
(6)  To provide accessibility to the special flood hazard area for maintenance and to reduce exposure to erosion, the maximum slopes shall not exceed four (horizontal) to one (vertical) in a fill area. The slope of excavated areas not in rock shall not exceed four (horizontal) to one (vertical). 
(7)  Vertical walls, terracing, and other treatments will be considered only as part of a landscaping plan and if access for maintenance is provided and if there is no unbalanced resultant streamflows. 
(8)  Landscaping plan submission shall include erosion control of cut and fill areas and sedimentation control during construction. 
(9)  The effects of existing or proposed public or private improvements will be used in determining water surface elevations an velocities. 
(10)  Any alteration of the special flood hazard area shall not cause any additional expense in any current or proposed public capital improvement.

(b)  Any officer of the police department of the city is hereby authorized to remove any vehicle parked, stopped or standing in or on any portion of a public street or an alley in violation of this chapter or the state traffic laws or when, in the opinion of the officer, the vehicle or obstruction constitutes a hazard, or interferes with the normal flow of traffic, or a normal function of a governmental agency, or by reason of a catastrophe, emergency or unusual circumstance, or the safety of the vehicle or other vehicles or the public is imperiled.

(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Corner lot means a residential property located at the intersection or confluence of two or more streets such that public street rights-of-way are directly adjacent to at least two contiguous sides of the lot. 
Driveway means the primary improved or unimproved parking surface which provides egress and ingress from a garage, carport or off-street parking area to an adjacent street or alley. 
Front yard means the area from the front face of a residential structure to the front property line or street right-of-way line, or when a structure does not exist, the area defined as a front yard by the zoning ordinance. 
Improved parking surface means an area used for the parking or storage of vehicles that is overlaid or otherwise paved with concrete, asphalt, paving stones or other hard-surfaced durable material approved by the building official. 
Rear yard means the area from the rear face of a residential structure to the rear property line, or when no structure exists, the area defined as a rear yard by the zoning ordinance. 
Side yard means the area from the side of a residential structure to the side property line, or when no structure exists, the area defined as a side yard by the zoning ordinance. 
Vehicle means every device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn or moved upon a street, highway, waterway or airway, and shall include any automobile, bus, truck, tractor, motorhouse, farm machinery, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, all-terrain vehicles, boats, aircraft, recreational vehicles, golf carts, go-carts, trailers, fifth-wheel trailer, camper, camper shells, wheeled towing frames, semitractor trailers, truck beds mounted on chassis and mobile homes. This definition does not include nonmotorized bicycles, small engine lawn mowers and devices of similar scale. 
(b)  Regulations. 
(1)  Parking on unimproved surfaces restricted. A person commits an offense if the person causes, suffers, permits or allows: 
a.  The parking or storage of any vehicle within a front yard of a residential single-family, townhouse, duplex lot or tract, upon any surface other than an improved surface; or 
b.  The parking or storage of any vehicle within a residential side yard or the residential rear yard of a corner lot, of a residential single-family, duplex or townhouse lot or tract, upon any surface other than an improved surface unless otherwise concealed from view from all public street rights-of-way by: 
1.  A solid, opaque screening fence or wall at least six feet in height; 
2.  Vegetation consisting of a solid hedgerow of evergreen shrubs, or trees and shrubs, providing full screening from the ground to a minimum height of six feet; 
3.  Any combination of subsections (b)(1)b.1 and b.2 of this section that effectively conceals the vehicle from view and accomplishes the required screening height; or 
4.  Any other form of compatible and appropriate screening as so determined by the building official. 
(2)  No driveway or improved parking surface shall cover more than 67 percent of a residential front yard, as defined in subsection (a) of this section or as defined in Ordinance No. 769, as amended. 
(3)  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution for parking or storing vehicles in an unimproved driveway if an existing residence is served by a driveway which does not constitute an improved parking surface at the time the ordinance from which this section is derived is enacted; however, at such time that the existing residence is completely rebuilt, or improvements to the same real property constitute 50 percent or more of the property's total assessed value, compliance with this section shall be required. 
(4)  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution for parking or storing vehicles on an unimproved surface or in an unconcealed or unscreened manner if the vehicles are parked in the rear yard and the rear yard is not a corner lot or directly adjacent to a public street right-of-way. 
(c)  Maintenance. All improved parking surfaces shall be maintained in good and safe condition and be free of holes, cracks or other failures that may affect the use, safety, appearance or drainage of the surface or of the adjoining property. 
(d)  Appeals. If it is determined that a vehicle is parked or stored upon property in violation of any of the provisions of this section, the owner, occupant or person responsible for the property shall have ten days, from receipt of notice, in which to file an appeal to the zoning board of adjustment by filing a request in writing for a hearing with the building official. In the event of an appeal, the zoning board of adjustment shall review the determination of the building official and shall have, by majority vote, jurisdiction to: 
(1)  Uphold the determination of the building official; 
(2)  Approve alternative paving materials where such materials are demonstrated to meet or exceed the requirements of concrete, asphalt or other approved paving material; 
(3)  Approve alternative screening materials where such materials are demonstrated to meet or exceed the requirements of this section; 
(4)  Allow a reasonable length of time, not to exceed a maximum of 24 months, in which to comply with the paving requirements of this section; or 
(5)  Upon the vote of no less than three-fourths of the members of the zoning board of adjustment voting at a meeting, grant a variance, to a requirement under this subsection where it is determined that, due to peculiarities of the property, such as shape or restricted area, literal enforcement of this subsection would result in an unnecessary hardship. 
Notification of the appeal shall be sent, by first class mail, to all property owners within 200 feet of the subject property at least ten days prior to the date of the appeal hearing. A sign giving notice of the appeal shall be posted by the city on the subject property at least ten days prior to the date of the appeal hearing and be maintained on the property until after the hearing. There shall be a $10.00 fee for appeals of the provisions of this section until January 1, 1992, at which time the fee shall be the normal fee as set by other ordinance for appeals to the zoning board of adjustment.

Sec. 82-301. - Location of driveway and street intersections. 
(a)  Principles. It is the policy of the city that the following principles be applied to the planning, design and permitting of the location of driveway and street intersections with freeway frontage roads: 
(1)  Access via driveways and streets to frontage roads at locations where access is provided on the effective date of this section is considered to meet the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Access to be constructed after the effective date of this section via driveways and streets to frontage roads should be provided only where needed and minimized wherever possible. 
(3)  Driveways providing access to properties abutting the frontage road should be located along cross streets and parallel streets where practical. As an alternative to direct driveway access to a frontage road, and where lot size and configuration do not reasonably allow for access via driveways along cross streets and parallel streets; combined, shared or mutual access drives must be considered. 
(4)  The distance between a street or driveway intersection with a frontage road and a ramp intersection with a frontage road must be maximized to the extent practical. 
(b)  Standards. It is the policy of the City of Farmers Branch the location of driveway and street intersections with freeway frontage roads be planned, designed and permitted in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  Access to the main lanes of a freeway is allowed only via ramps. 
(2)  Driveway and street intersections are not permitted at locations where access control limits are established by right-of-way instrument. 
(3)  Driveway and street intersections are not permitted within 250 feet measured in the direction of travel from the point of intersection of the travel lanes of an exit ramp with the travel lanes of a frontage road. At locations where a public street or an essential driveway (for which alternative access locations are not practical) must be located within the 250-foot separation distance from an exit ramp, pavement design and traffic control measures in the vicinity of the intersection may be required to restrict and channelize access. Driveway and street intersections within 460 feet beyond the intersection of an exit ramp with a frontage road may be permitted only in cases where the city engineer or his designee determines that alternative access conforming to this policy cannot reasonably be located. (A graphical depiction of exit ramp access limitations is shown in Exhibit 1.) 
(4)  Driveway and street intersections are not permitted within 100 feet measured opposite to the direction of travel from the point of intersection of the travel lanes of an exit ramp with the travel lanes of a frontage road. At locations where a public street or an essential driveway (for which alternative access locations are not practical) must be located within the 100-foot separation distance from an exit ramp, pavement design and traffic control measures in the vicinity of the intersection may be required to restrict and channelize access. Driveway and street intersections within 300 feet in advance of the intersection of an exit ramp with a frontage road may be permitted only in cases where the city engineer or his designee determines that alternative access conforming to this policy cannot reasonably be located. (A graphical depiction of entrance ramp access limitations is shown in Exhibit 2.) 
(5)  At entrance and exit ramp locations, driveway and street intersections are not permitted between (a) the point of intersection of the travel lanes of an exit ramp with the travel lanes of a frontage road and (b) the edge of any continuous roadway pavement connecting the ramp and the frontage road. Essential driveway and street intersections with a frontage road may be permitted in such locations only in cases where the city engineer or his designee determines that alternative access conforming to this policy cannot reasonably be located. 
(c)  Conformance of certain intersections. The Citywide Master Thoroughfare Plan provides for the planned addition of new street intersections with frontage roads on the state highway system at the following locations: Mercer Parkway at IH35E, Knightsbridge Road at IH635, and Bond Street at IH635. Resolution No. 2001-004 and Ordinance No. 2578 approved the extension of Mira Lago Boulevard to a planned intersection with a future frontage road extension west of Luna road on the south side of IH635.

(i)  Evidence presented under subsection (h) of this section must be presented through oral testimony or by affidavit under penalty of perjury. Evidence through oral testimony must be presented at the administrative adjudication hearing. Evidence by affidavit under penalty of perjury may be presented by mail. 
(j)  If the registered vehicle owner named in the notice of violation complies with subsections (h) and (i) of this section, the registered vehicle owner may not be held liable for civil school bus stop arm fines, penalties, and costs, and the law enforcement officer shall send the notice of violation to the vehicle owner who held legal title to the vehicle at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken.

Sec. 86-193. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the administrative authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the administrative authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the administrative authority monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the administrative authority samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 6.8, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-194. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 86-190. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 86-186, 86-188 and 86-189. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the administrative authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 6.9, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-195. - Analytical requirements. 
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 6.10, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-196. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the administrative authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 6.11, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-197. - Timing. 
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 6.12, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-198. - Record keeping. 
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the administrative authority.

Users shall allow the administrative authority, control authority, TCEQ, EPA, or their designated representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the administrative authority, control authority, TCEQ, EPA, or their designated representative, will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The administrative authority or control authority shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The administrative authority may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a minimum, annually to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the administrative authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the administrative authority or control authority access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
(6)  In accordance with 40 CFR 403, the administrative authority shall inspect and monitor each permitted significant industrial user a minimum of once per year. If the administrative authority elects to perform compliance monitoring for the industry then the administrative authority will monitor the industry a minimum of semiannually. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 7.1, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-217. - Search warrants. 
If the administrative authority has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the administrative authority may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate court. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 7.2, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-218. - Confidential information. 
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the administrative authority's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the administrative authority, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 8, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-219. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
The administrative authority shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which during the previous 12 months were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; or 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); or 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the administrative authority believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; or 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the administrative authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; or 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; or 
(6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; or

Secs. 86-22086-235. - Reserved.  
Subdivision VII. - Enforcement Remedies 
 
Sec. 86-236. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. 
(1)  When the administrative authority finds that any user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the administrative authority may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within the timeframe specified in the notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by that user to the administrative authority. Submission of this plan in no way relieves that user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the administrative authority to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(2)  A notice of violation is properly served when it is delivered to the holder of the permit, or the person in charge, or when it is sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the holder of a permit issued under this chapter or the person found violating this chapter. 
(b)  Consent orders. The administrative authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (c)and (d) below and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The administrative authority may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the administrative authority and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the administrative authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the administrative authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, water and/or sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Administrative orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. An administrative order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does an administrative order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the administrative authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the administrative authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Emergency suspensions. The administrative authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonable appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The administrative authority may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the administrative authority may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of water and/or sewer connections, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The administrative authority may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the administrative authority that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (g), above, are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the administrative authority prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (c) and (g), above. 
Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this subsection. 
(g)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 86-166, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to termination of discharge: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; or 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; or 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; or 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in subdivision II. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 86-236(c) why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the administrative authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

(a)  Injunctive relief. When the administrative authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the administrative authority may petition the appropriate court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The administrative authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any person found violating, or continuing to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City of Farmers Branch for a maximum civil penalty of $2,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties may accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The administrative authority may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed the maximum amount set by the city as allowed by state law, per violation, per day, or imprisonment as decided by an appropriate court, or both. 
(2)  Any person who introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty not to exceed the maximum amount set by the city as allowed by state law, or be subject to imprisonment as decided by an appropriate court, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed the maximum amount set by the city as allowed by state law, per violation, per day, or imprisonment as decided by an appropriate court, or both. 
(4)  Any person is criminally responsible for a violation of this chapter if: 
a.  The person commits or assists in the commission of a violation, or causes or permits another person to commit a violation; or 
b.  The person owns or manages the property or facilities determined to be the cause of the illegal discharge under this chapter. 
A culpable mental state is not required to prove an offense under this chapter. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The administrative authority may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the administrative authority may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the administrative authority is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(e)  Applicability of more stringent regulations. If national pretreatment standards, categorical or otherwise, more stringent than the discharge limits prescribed in this chapter are promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for certain industries or dischargers, the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 11, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-238. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Performance bonds. The administrative authority may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City of Farmers Branch, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the administrative authority to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(b)  Financial assurance. The administrative authority may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
(c)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.

Subdivision VIII. - Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations 
 
Sec. 86-256. - Action brought in federal court only; upset provision. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the administrative authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 13.1, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-257. - Action brought in municipal or state court only; act of God provision. 
(a)  An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe is not a violation. 
(b)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. 
(c)  In the event that subsections (a) and (b) of this section has been demonstrated the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(Ord. No. 2709, § 13.2, 2-17-2003)  
Sec. 86-258. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the administrative authority, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the administrative authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass, the administrative authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  (1)  If the bypass is prohibited, the administrative authority may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The administrative authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the administrative authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

Sec. 86-268. - Surcharge. 
A surcharge shall be assessed each user discharging wastewater with BOD and TSS concentrations in excess of normal domestic sewage. The industrial wastewater surcharge shall be calculated using the following formula: 
SC = Q * 8.34 * [ a (BOD - 250) + b (TSS - 250) ] * c 
SC 	= 	Surcharge based on excess concentration in dollars 
Q 	= 	Flow in million gallons 
8.34 	= 	Conversion factor (8.34 lbs of water per gallon) 
BOD 	= 	Biochemical Oxygen Demand as determined by approved method 
TSS 	= 	Total Suspended Solids as determined by approved method 
250 	= 	Normal limits of BOD and TSS in domestic sewage 
a 	= 	Unit cost of BOD treatment in dollars per pound 
b 	= 	Unit cost of TSS treatment in dollars per pound 
c 	= 	Administrative overhead recovery factor to be periodically established

Sec. 86-277. - Sewer rates. 
(a)  The monthly rates or charges for services furnished by the sanitary sewer system of the city shall be in the schedule in appendix A of this Code. 
(b)  All customers connected to the sanitary sewer system who have a source of water supply that is in addition to, or in lieu of, the city water supply must have a meter approved by the superintendent of utilities on such source if any water from such source enters the sanitary sewer system. The volume charge as set forth in appendix A of this Code shall be based on the sum of the volumes of water delivered by all sources of supply which may be discharged to the sanitary sewer system. 
(c)  Any user of the sanitary sewer system may have installed at their expense a separate water meter on the city water system if all the flow through such meter will be used for purposes which preclude such flow from entering the sanitary sewer system. The water flow through such separate meters will not be considered in determining sanitary sewer service charges. 
(d)  The volume charge as set forth in appendix A of this Code shall be for the discharge of normal strength wastewater having a biochemical oxygen demand not exceeding 250 milligrams per liter and suspended solids not exceeding 250 milligrams per liter. If the sewage flow from the city, measured at the point of entry to the Trinity River Authority System, is found to have a biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids content exceeding 250 milligrams per liter, and if a surcharge is imposed upon the city because of such overstrength sewage, the city may, at its option: 
(1)  Require a pretreatment of the wastewater discharged by any user found to be discharging wastewater having a biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids content exceeding 250 milligrams per liter to the extent required to prevent the total flow from the city from exceeding the surcharge limits, measured at the point of entry to the Trinity River Authority System, with the provision that no user shall be required to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids content of wastewater discharged by that user to less than 250 milligrams per liter; or 
(2)  Require that any users found to be discharging wastewater having a biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids content exceeding 250 milligrams per liter pay their pro rata share of any surcharge imposed upon the city. The proportionate part of the total surcharge to be paid by any user shall be determined with consideration given to the volume of wastewater discharged by the user, the concentration of biochemical oxygen demand of that user's wastewater above the base level of 250 milligrams per liter and the concentration of suspended solids of such wastewater above a base level of 250 milligrams per liter.

In case a property or tract of land is so situated or shaped that the front foot rule creates an inequitable basis, as between it and other tracts of land in the city, then, in that event, the city shall determine the proper charge in accord with the intent and purpose of this article. No person shall acquire any vested right under the terms and provisions of this article. The terms and provisions of this article shall be deemed to be severable, in that if any section, phrase, word or part thereof shall be deemed to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. 
(Code 1969, § 27-46)  
Sec. 86-337. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Abutting foot means property contiguous and adjacent to a water and/or sewer line. 
Approach and off-site main mean water and/or sewer mains totally outside of a tract of land to be subdivided and developed for resale. A main adjacent to a tract of land to be subdivided and developed shall not be considered to be an approach main. 
Consumer means the actual user of water from a city water connection. 
Developer means the owner or agent of the owner subdividing and installing utilities to serve lots or tracts for resale or lease. 
Frontage means property abutting either side of a water and/or sewer line. 
Oversize cost means the difference between the actual cost of the main as built and the size of main determined to be the minimum size required to serve the subdivision. Only those mains larger than 12-inch mains shall be considered for oversize cost. Consideration shall then be given only if such larger mains are required to serve land not owned by the developer. 
Property owner means the record title holder of premises served with water from a connection by the city. 
(Code 1969, § 27-47) 
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2.  
Sec. 86-338. - Determination of pro rata charges. 
The amount of pro rata charge shall be determined by dividing the total cost of the particular water and/or sewer main extension by the total frontage, in feet, of all properties, including street intersections, which may be served by the main. If water and/or sewer mains are extended by the city, the total cost shall include a ten percent fee for engineering. The frontage of all platted property now satisfactorily connected to the water or sanitary sewer system shall be deducted from the total frontage in determining the respective water or sewer pro rata charge. 
(Code 1969, § 27-48)  
Sec. 86-339. - Application of pro rata charges. 
(a)  On lots or tracts of land which extend through from one street to another, with frontage on both streets, and where the distance between the street lines is 260 feet or more, then the pro rata charges herein provided for shall be paid on both frontages when a connection is secured to the lot or tract. 
(b)  Where lots or tracts are irregular in size or shape, then the pro rata charges shall be based upon equivalent rectangular lots or tracts using one front foot for each 150 square feet of area. 
(c)  Where lots or tracts are used for other than single-family residential purposes, then the pro rata charges provided in this section shall be paid on the frontage on all streets which the property may abut. 
(d)  Where lots or tracts are used for single-family residential purposes, and which abut upon two streets, the pro rata charges provided in this section shall be payable only on the shorter frontage on which a water or sewer main exists. 
(e)  Where lots or tracts are used for single-family residential purposes only, and have a depth greater than 150 feet, the pro rata charges herein provided shall be paid on the frontage on all streets which the property may abut minus 150 feet for each frontage in excess of one. 
(f)  For property in the state of development for which a building permit has been issued at the time of the passage of this ordinance, any pro rata charges due shall be at the rate in effect at the time the building permit was issued. A property owner eligible for a water or sewer main extension, and whose request had been accepted prior to the passage of this ordinance, shall be charged the pro rata charges due under the then applicable ordinance. 
(g)  In addition to the pro rata charges on water and sanitary sewer mains, the property owner must pay the tapping charges, as established by the city. 
(Code 1969, § 27-49)  
Sec. 86-340. - Extension of water and sewer lines for individual owners. 
(a)  Upon the request of the owner, or his agent, of a given lot or tract of land, for the purpose of this article known as the applicant accompanied by the payment of the charges due under this article, the city may extend or cause to have extended, lay or construct all necessary sanitary sewer and/or water mains, including necessary appurtenances, a maximum distance of 100 feet, excluding street intersections, plus the distance across the frontage necessary to provide the service for which application has been made. The applicant to be served shall be required to pay the charges provided for in this section. The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extension shall be required to pay the charges provided for in this section at such time as their property is connected to the mains thus laid. Where an applicant for service secures an extension and service under this particular option for main extension, he shall pay the pro rata charges on all property owned by him and which is served by the extension required. In applying the 100-foot rule, the required extension of main shall be figured in such manner as to leave out of the calculations that portion of any main adjacent to property already having other than a temporary service, and for which the pro rata charges thereon have been paid or credited under the terms of this article. 
(b)  An exception to the 100-foot rule shall be made where two or more individual applicants desire water and/or sanitary sewer service and the nearest applicant is more than 100 feet from the existing lines. In that case, the city may extend their mains upon payment of the charges due under this article, provided there is one customer for every 100 feet of such extension, excluding street intersections and that portion of the extension adjacent to property already having other than temporary water and/or sanitary sewer service. An exception to the 100-foot rule may also be made when an individual applicant is more than 100 feet from existing water and/or sewer mains and the city council approves such extension as being in the best interests of the city. 
(c)  The city shall not be responsible for extensions under the conditions of this section unless the necessary right-of-way in a street, alley or easement is available, at no charge to the city, for the construction and continued maintenance of the desired extensions. 
(Code 1969, § 27-50)  
Sec. 86-341. - Extension by special agreement with city council. 
(a)  No provision of this article shall prohibit the city council from entering into a special agreement or contract in a form acceptable to the city council for the extension of water and sewer mains, which will assist in the orderly and beneficial development of the city. 
(b)  The provisions of this section are not intended to apply to the extension of water and sewer mains for the normal development of property. This section is specifically reserved for those unusual cases in which the city council may provide a means for the extension of water and sewer mains which will be an integral part of the planned, future utility systems and, at the same time, provide for land development and improvement which would not otherwise be economically feasible. The provisions of this section are not intended to relieve the developer from his responsibilities as provided in section 86-342. 
(Code 1969, § 27-51)  
Sec. 86-342. - Extension of water and sewer mains for the development of property. 
(a)  After the final plat of a subdivision has been given approval by the city planning and zoning commission, and filed for record, the developer shall provide extensions of water and sewer mains under the provisions of this section. The developer shall be responsible for the design and preparation of construction plans for water and sanitary sewer facilities to serve the subdivision, including any approach mains that may be required. These plans shall conform in all details to the city's standards, as to the design, grade, location, size and quality of materials and construction. Plans and profiles shall be shown in scales in not less than one inch to 100 feet, horizontal and one inch to ten feet, vertical. Plans and profiles shall show clearly all surface improvements, all existing or proposed subsurface utility lines and obstructions, and street and alley grades, as approved by the director of public works. The engineer submitting the plans and profiles must be a registered professional civil engineer in the state, and he must affix his seal and signature to the tracings of all plans and profiles. One set of reproducible tracings of water and sewer plans shall be submitted to the director of public works for approval, together with two copies of the water and sewer plans and profiles, two copies of the plans and profiles of the storm sewers and street grades as approved by the director of public works, and one copy of the plat of the addition that has been recorded in the records of the county, and has been so stamped. Upon final approval, the tracings will be returned to the developer's engineer for the purpose of making such prints as he may require, after which the tracings shall be returned to become permanent property of the city. All plans, distributed to contractors, material suppliers, and those plans used during construction of the improvements, shall be prints of the tracings as approved by the director of public works. 
(b)  Upon approval of the plans by the city, the developer may enter into a contract with any individual, or may, himself, construct the system as so planned; provided, however, that the construction and installation of the water and sewer lines, or either of them, shall be supervised by inspectors of the city, to see that the installation is made in accordance with the plans and the city's standard specifications, which shall be a part of the installation contract. The developer shall furnish the director of public works with copies of the bids received, and payments made, for the installation of the water and sewer system, if he wishes to be eligible for any pro rata refunds to which he may be entitled under the terms of this article. Such bids shall show unit costs in sufficient detail to enable the construction costs of various segments of mains installed by the developer to be determined. The city retains the right to review the unit prices and to determine that the prices, as submitted, are representative of actual construction costs prevailing at the time. When the project is ready for construction, line grade stakes will be set by the developer's engineer, but these stakes will not be set until after the developer's engineer has properly staked, on the ground with iron pins, all pins, all points of curves, all points of tangency, all block corners and all easements within the subdivision. The developer shall furnish the city with the name of the contractor who is to install the water and sewer mains. The contractor shall not commence any work within the subdivision until authorized to do so by the director of public works. No installation of water or sewer mains shall be made at any location other than a dedicated street, alley or easement, running in favor of the city, which shall be filed of record by the owner of the addition. Any such installation, when made, shall become the property of the city, free and clear of all incumbrances, and any contract entered between the developer and a contractor shall provide for a performance bond, such as the city uses in its standard specifications, which shall be a part of such installation contract. The city shall be named as one of the beneficiaries in such bond. If the developer makes the installation himself, then he shall execute a performance bond in favor of the city, in the same form and conditioned in the same manner, as provided for in the standard contract documents used by the city in making of water and sanitary sewer installations. The city specifically reserves the option to advertise for bids and install all or any portion of extensions of water and sewer lines over 12 inches in size where the costs of such lines, as determined by the bids taken by the developer, are not considered reasonable. In those cases in which existing mains are in place, and are incorporated within the water and/or sewer system of the developer, the developer shall pay the city such pro rata charges as may be due under the terms of this article. 
(Code 1969, § 27-52)  
Sec. 86-343. - Refunds. 
(a)  All refunds provided for in this article shall be made on May 1, and include funds then accrued to the credit of the developers and others. The contract entered into by any property owner in the city, under the provisions of this article, shall be effective only for a period of five years after the date of the contract. No refunds will be made by the city to any applicant or contracting party after this five-year period has expired, nor shall the city ever be liable for payment of interest on any deposits, payments or refunds provided for in this section. 
(b)  Developers shall be eligible for refunds of certain portions of the costs incurred by them in the installation of water and sewer mains under certain conditions. For mains 12 inches and smaller, which have been constructed by the developer entirely at his own expense, as approach mains, and for mains lying along one or more sides of a subdivided tract, which serve property other than the subdivision for which the extensions were made, the developer shall be credited with refunds equal to the pro rata charges which may be collectable from other parties under the terms of this article. 
(c)  If such mains are larger than 12 inches in size, and if the developer did not receive a credit for oversize cost at the time of installation, he shall receive a credit for refund equal to the difference between the cost of such water and/or sewer main and one-half the cost of a 12-inch main, or such sizes as are required to serve the subdivision for which the extensions are required. 
(Code 1969, § 27-53)  
Sec. 86-344. - Temporary lines. 
Where temporary lines are constructed as an expedient to develop a particular area, such as across easements within the subdivision of which no frontage can be connected, or where sewers are constructed which otherwise are not required in the ultimate plan of development for the sanitary sewer system, the developer will bear the total cost without refund. 
(Code 1969, § 27-54)  
Sec. 86-345. - No funds available. 
In no event may the city be required to make extensions under the provisions of this article if there are no funds available on hand for the purpose. 
(Code 1969, § 27-55)  
Sec. 86-346. - Charges to be credited to water pro rata fund. 
Any and all sums of money hereafter collected as a pro rata charge or deposit for water and/or sewer extensions, at the rates set forth in this article, shall be credited to the water pro rata fund of the city and all refunds shall be paid from this same account. Interest earned on pro rata fund investments shall be used to accelerate the retirement of the city's water and sewer revenue bonds. 
(Code 1969, § 27-56)  
Sec. 86-347. - Pro rata charges for mains existing at the time of passage of this article. 
With the exception of those mains which have been installed under a contract with the city and which provide a definite repayment schedule as property is developed, the pro rata charges for connection to a water main existing at the time of passage of this article shall be an amount established by the city and listed in appendix A of this Code per front foot of the lot or tract of land to which water connections may be made. The pro rata charge for sewer connections under the same conditions shall be an amount established by the city and listed in appendix A of this Code per front foot of the lot or tract of land which such connections may be made. For those lots having building permits already issued, or other commitments made at the time of passage of this article, the pro rata charges shall be the same as those which have been previously agreed upon. 
(Code 1969, § 27-57)  
Sec. 86-348. - Lift stations and special installations. 
If a lift station or other special installations are required, such lift station or special installations shall be installed under separate agreements between the city and the developer.

B.  Rules of Interpretation 
The boundary lines of zoning districts shown on the Zoning District Map are usually located along streets, alleys, property lines, or extensions thereof. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundary of a zoning district as shown on the Zoning District Map, the following rules shall apply. 
1.  Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
2.  Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lines. 
3.  Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the boundary lines of the city limits shall be construed as following such boundary lines. 
4.  Zoning district boundaries indicated as following railroad rights-of-way shall be construed to be the centerline of such right-of-way or, if no centerline is established, the boundary shall be interpreted to be midway between the boundaries of the right-of-way. 
5.  Zoning district boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines. In the event of a change in the shoreline, the zoning district boundary shall be construed as following the relocated shoreline. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the zoning district boundary is shown to follow a shoreline, but the property line of the property on which the body of water is located extends beyond the shoreline located on the property, the zoning district boundary shall be construed as extending to the property line of said property. 
6.  Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the zoning district boundary is shown to follow the centerlines of a stream, river, lake or other body of water, and the centerline later changes, but the property line of the property located on the stream, river, lake or other body of water extends beyond the adjusted centerline, the zoning district boundary shall be construed as extending to the property line of said property. 
7.  Zoning district boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in Section 2.2B.1 through 2.2B.5 shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Zoning District Map shall be determined from the graphic scale on the Zoning District Map. 
8.  Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the City Council, or whenever such area is franchised for building purposes, the zoning district line adjoining each side of such street, alley or other public way shall be automatically extended to the centerline of such vacated street, alley or way, and all area so involved shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended zoning districts. 
9.  Where physical features of the ground differ from information shown on the Zoning District Map, or the application of Section 2.2B.1 through Section 2.2B.8 cannot resolve the uncertainty of how or if a property is zoned, the property shall be deemed to be located where the majority of the area of the property is located.

5.5 - BEER AND WINE SALES OVERLAY DISTRICT 
A.  Purpose 
A Beer and Wine Sales Overlay District ("BW") is an area designated within the City where property located within the district's boundaries may be developed and used as a Beer and Wine Package Sales Establishment. Because the sale of alcoholic beverages has been prohibited in all zoning districts except in Heavy Industrial (HI) Districts by right and in Light Industrial ("LI") Zoning Districts by specific use permit since 1972, the Beer and Wine Sales Overlay District is intended, consistent with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code, to lessen the 1972 restrictions on the location of establishments which may sell beer and wine for off-premises consumption to specific areas within existing zoning districts where such establishments may be located in addition to the uses allowed within such zoning districts. The use and development of property located within a Beer and Wine Sales Overlay District shall continue to be subject to the applicable use and development regulations of the base zoning district, but may additionally be used and developed as Beer and Wine Package Establishment. The designation of a Beer and Wine Sales Overlay District is intended to substantially advance a legitimate governmental interest that includes enhancing the quality of life in City, to regulate the character of growth within the Beer and Wine Sales Overlay District, and to ensure the careful and orderly growth of such establishments.

E.  Written Protests Procedures 
1.  Purpose. 
a.  State law expressly enables the governing body of a municipality to establish procedures for adopting and enforcing zoning regulations and district boundaries. Pursuant to that authority, the City Council enacts this Section 6.2E governing the receipt of written protests submitted for the purpose of requiring the favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the City Council to effect a change in a zoning district classification or boundary. 
b.  This Section 6.2E. is not intended to conflict with state law; it is being enacted at a time when the state law does not explicitly provide how, when, or where a written protest must be filed. The City Council expressly recognizes that this Section 6.2E. may be partially or completely preempted at any such time that state law is amended to explicitly provide how, when, or where a written protest must be filed. 
c.  This Section 6.2E. is intended to accomplish the following listed objectives that, in the opinion of the city council, are fully in keeping with the purposes, spirit, and intent of the state law: 
i.  To allow city staff sufficient time to accurately calculate the land area percentages that determines the voting requirement; 
ii.  To protect the rights of all parties by establishing minimum criteria to assure the reliability of written protests received; 
iii.  To protect the rights of those protesting by establishing procedures and deadlines which are not unduly burdensome or restrictive; and 
iv.  To promote order and maintain the integrity of the zoning process. 
2.  Form of protest. 
a.  A protest must be in writing submitted on a form prepared by the city secretary and, at a minimum, contain the following information: 
i.  A description of the zoning case at issue; 
ii.  The printed or typewritten names of all persons signing the protest of the proposed change in zoning district classification or boundary; 
iii.  A description of the area of lots or land owned by the protesting parties that is either covered by the proposed change or located within 200 feet of the area covered by the proposed change; 
iv.  The mailing addresses of all persons signing the protest; 
v.  The date and time the protest is signed; and 
vi.  If signing the protest on behalf of the owner of property pursuant to a power of attorney, so indicate on the protest and submit a copy of the power of attorney with the protest. 
b.  The protest must bear the original signatures of all persons required to sign under Section 6.2E.3, below. 
c.  The return of the notice provided to an owner pursuant to Section 6.2B.3 shall not constitute a written protest pursuant to this Section 6.2E. 
3.  Who must sign. 
a.  A protest must be signed by the owner of the property in question, or by a person authorized by power of attorney to sign the protest on behalf of the owner. If the property is owned by two or more people, the protest must be signed by a majority of the owners, or by a person authorized by power of attorney to sign the protest on behalf of a majority of the owners, except that in the case of community property, the city shall presume the written protest of one spouse to be the protest of both. 
b.  In the case of property owned by a corporation, the protest must be signed by the president, a vice-president, or by an attorney in fact authorized to sign the protest on behalf of the corporation. In the case of property owned by a general or limited partnership, the protest must be signed by a general partner or by an attorney in fact authorized to sign the protest on behalf of the partnership. In the case of property owned by a trust, the protest must be signed by the trustee(s) authorized under the trust agreement to perform actions with respect to the property. 
c.  Lots or land subject to a condominium regime are presumed to be commonly owned in undivided interests by the owners of all condominium units and under the control of the governing body of the condominium. For such lots or land to be included in calculating the lots or land area protesting a proposed rezoning, the written protest must state that the governing body of the condominium has authorized a protest in accordance with procedures required by its bylaws, and that the person signing the protest is authorized to act on behalf of the governing body of the condominium. A written protest signed by the owner of an individual condominium unit shall not be accepted unless the filing party produces legal documents governing the condominium which clearly establish the right of an individual owner to act with respect to his or her respective undivided interest in the common elements of the condominium. 
d.  For purposes of this subsection, the "owner" of the property for which a protest is being submitted shall be determined to be the owner of the property shown in the records of the Dallas Central Appraisal District as of the date of delivery of the protest to the city secretary. A person with only a leasehold or easement interest in property is not an "owner" for purposes of filing a protest pursuant to this subsection. 
e.  A person who is not named on the records of the Dallas Central Appraisal District as the owner of the property may submit additional information to the city attorney indicating that the person is the current record owner of the property identified in the protest. The determination of the city attorney as to the sufficiency of such information and whether or not the person should be considered the record owner of the property for purpose of filing the protest is final. Any additional information submitted pursuant to this paragraph (e) must be submitted by the deadline required for submission of the protest. 
4.  Filing deadline. 
a.  A written protest must be filed with the city secretary before noon of the business day immediately preceding the date advertised for the Commission or City Council public hearing in the statutory notice published in the official newspaper of the City. A protest sent through the mail must be received by the city secretary before the deadline. 
b.  Before the public hearing on the case, the filing deadline is automatically extended whenever the public hearing is re-advertised in the official newspaper of the city pursuant to statutory notice requirements. 
c.  After the public hearing has begun, and 
i.  the public hearing is concluded with no action being taken on the zoning amendment at the same meeting and a subsequent public hearing and advertising that public hearing in the official newspaper of the city pursuant to statutory notice requirements; or 
ii.  the public hearing is continued to a date certain as otherwise allowed under the Texas Open Meetings Act; 
iii,  the filing deadline may be extended to noon of the working day immediately preceding the newly advertised public hearing date or the date to which the public hearing is continued, as the case may be. 
d.  Written protests may be filed electronically be emailing the written protest as an attachment in .pdf format to the city secretary or by sending via facsimile transmission to the published facsimile telephone number for the office of the city secretary. 
e.  For purposes of determining compliance with the filing deadline, the date and time the city secretary's office actually receives the written protest is solely determinative. 
5.  Withdrawals of protests filed. Withdrawals of protests filed must be in writing and filed with the city secretary before the filing deadline for protests. The provisions of this subsection governing the form and filing of protests apply equally to withdrawals. 
6.  Presumptions of validity. 
a.  In all cases where a protest has been properly signed pursuant to this subsection, the city shall presume that the signatures appearing on the protest are authentic and that the persons or officers whose signatures appear on the protest are either owners of the property or authorized to sign on behalf of one or more owners as represented. 
b.  In cases of multiple ownership, the city shall presume that a properly signed protest which on its face purports to represent a majority of the property owners does in fact represent a majority of the property owners. 
c.  The presumptions in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above are rebuttable, and the city attorney may advise the city council that a presumption should not be followed in a specific case based on extrinsic evidence presented. 
7.  Conflicting instruments. In the event that multiple protests and withdrawals are filed on behalf of the same owner, the instrument with the latest date and time execution controls.
