held on May 9, 2015.

holding of an election on that date.
f. The three Councilmembers elected on May 9, 2015 shall serve as Councilmembers for Place
Four, Place Five, and Place Six under this Charter, and lots shall be drawn to determine which
Councilmember will be designated as serving in Place Four, Place Five, and Place Six. Under this

Charter, the City Council shall declare the Office of City Council Member, Place Three vacant, and
shall proceed to call a special election in accordance with the requirements of the Texas Constitution
and the Texas Election Code applicable to vacancies in offices with three (3) year terms. The person
elected to the Office of Councilmember, Place Three at the special election shall serve until a
successor shall be elected for a full three (3) year term at the City's general election in 2017, or
another date designated by the City Council if changes to state law prevent the holding of an

authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the code shall include all substantive permanent and
general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all
changes made thereby in the code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly
into the code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the
new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the code will be current through the date
of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.
(b) In preparing a supplement to this code, all portions of the code which have been repealed shall be
excluded from the code by omission thereof from reprinted pages.
(c) When preparing a supplement to this code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization
authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of
ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code.
For example, the codifier may:
(1) Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
(2) Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for articles, sections and other subdivisions
of the code printed in the supplement and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;
(3) Assign appropriate numbers to articles, sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the
code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing article or section or
other subdivision numbers;
(4) Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning to “this chapter,” “this
article,” “this section,” “this subsection,” etc., as the case may be; and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance
material inserted into the code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or
effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.

state, and a culpable mental state is hereby not required to prove any such offense. Unless otherwise
specifically stated in this code, any violation of this code or of any ordinance that is punishable by a fine that
exceeds five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall require a culpable mental state.
(d) No penalty shall be greater or less than the penalty provided for the same or a similar offense under the
laws of the state.
(e) Unless otherwise stated in this code or in any ordinance, each day any violation of this code or of any

members. Except in unusual circumstances, these meetings will be held at the city hall, at a
stated time. The purpose of such meetings is to act upon matters of an emergency or critical
nature that should not be delayed until a regular meeting. Special meetings, as all other
meetings, unless meeting specific criteria, shall be open to the public. Agendas must be
posted in accordance with state law, and minutes of such meetings will be maintained as for a
regular meeting.

shall be to hear reports and to discuss in depth matters of interest to the city.
(B) No official action will be taken at such meetings, but minutes should be taken. Notice of
the workshop must be posted in accordance with state law. The public is welcome to attend,
but will not participate in the discussions unless invited by the chairperson or members of the

matter unless that matter is listed on an agenda that has been posted as required as required
by the Open Meetings Act.
(Ordinance 180-05-02-08, sec. 1, adopted 1/25/05)
Sec. 1.02.032 Agenda
The following stipulations relate to the agenda for meetings of the board or commission. No action can be taken
on any item unless that item has been posted on the agenda for that meeting and the agenda posted at city hall
seventy-two (72) hours prior to the meeting.
(1) Preparation of agenda. City staff will exercise their best judgment in determining the most
important items received for placement on the agenda and adding other items of business to come
before the board or commission. An item not appearing on the agenda shall not be taken up for
discussion as a matter of the board or commission business during any board or commission
meeting. However, the board or commission may receive items as information.
(2) Distribution of agenda packets.
(A) The agenda packets for all regular meetings will be made up and forwarded by e-mail to
members.
(B) Agenda packets will be e-mailed on the Friday prior to the meeting.
(C) This should afford ample time for the board and commission members to inquire into the
nature of each matter to be discussed and to personally investigate the matter so as to better
inform himself or herself before a board or commission meeting. Board or commission
members are encouraged to call the city manager or staff regarding any questions about items
on the agenda or any other matter that concerns the city.
(3) Special meetings and workshop meetings.
(A) In special meetings, as in all meetings of boards and commissions, the board or
commission will restrict consideration only to the item or items on the agenda. No item will be
accepted by the chairperson for discussion at any meeting unless it has been posted on the
agenda for that meeting.
(B) Occasionally, public hearings may be held at workshop meetings for the convenience of
the public. Items to be discussed at a workshop meeting must be placed on an agenda for that
meeting and the agenda posted as required. Minutes will be kept of all workshop meetings.
(Ordinance 180-05-02-08, sec. 2, adopted 1/25/05; Ordinance 397, sec. II(B), adopted 9/8/15)
Sec. 1.02.033 Proceedings
(a) Generally; presiding officer. These procedures shall apply to all meetings of boards and commissions.
The chairperson shall be the presiding officer at all meetings of the boards or commissions and have a voice in
all of its proceedings. Board and commission members shall speak in board and commission meetings only
upon being recognized by the presiding officer, whose recognition shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the
event of the absence of the chairperson, the co-chairperson shall be the presiding officer. In the event of the
absence of the chairperson and co-chairperson, the board or commission members in attendance, if
constituting a quorum, shall select one of its members to preside over that meeting. The chairperson and board
or commission members shall refrain from private conversations with one another during meetings.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 29/500
(b) Call to order. All meetings will begin promptly at the hour stated. A quorum shall be the attendance of a
majority of the members of the board or commission. In the event of there not being a quorum at the time the
meeting is called to order, the board or commission may discuss matters, but shall not take any action until a
quorum is present. In the event the chairperson or a board or commission member leaves the room and the
remaining members do not constitute a quorum, the board or commission may continue to discuss matters
listed on the agenda, but may take no vote or conduct other business.
(c) Agenda. Ordinarily the chairperson or other presiding officer will follow the agenda as published; however,
the presiding officer shall have, subject to the approval of the council, the prerogative of addressing items out of
order should such change facilitate guests or other factors.
(d) Presentation of agenda items. Staff members may attend board and commission meetings and be
available as resource persons. This does not preclude a staff member representing himself or herself at a
meeting, but staff members should be cautious about taking positions that could be contrary to the position of
their supervisors, for this could cause questions concerning their ability to follow through with instructions from
their supervisors.
(e) Presentations from the floor.
(1) All guests and other persons who are to speak to the board or commission, including staff
members, shall wait in the audience until recognized. When called by the presiding officer for an
opportunity to be heard, that person shall move immediately to the podium and make their
comments.
(2) The speaker shall identify herself or himself by name and address and the agency
represented, if any. The speaker shall remain at the podium until all board or commission questions
have been answered and the chairperson has dismissed the speaker. Speaking from the podium will
assure that the recording equipment picks up the presentation.
(f) Board or commission action.
(1) After the board or commission has heard all of the facts, reviewed the supporting data, and
listened to the arguments for and against each agenda item, it will act by approving or disapproving
a motion. In the event that there is no motion or no second to a motion, no action will be deemed
taken. Robert's Rules of Order would require a motion to act prior to any discussion of any item on
the agenda; however, the board or commission policy permits introduction of an item and discussion
prior to making a motion for action.
(2) The board or commission acts in one of two methods. It may make a recommendation to the
governing body or in some cases take final action.
(3) From time to time, a question is raised about the legality of a person making a motion and then
voting against his/her own motion. There is no prohibition in doing that. The person may be opposed
to an action and want the motion on the floor so that person can register the opposing vote.
(Ordinance 180-05-02-08, sec. 3, adopted 1/25/05)
Sec. 1.02.034 Minutes of meetings (optional)
(a) A staff member appointed by the city manager will keep minutes of all meetings. The proceedings will be
recorded and the tapes will be kept for four (4) years unless there have been questions raised which indicate
possible need to keep the tapes longer.
(b) The minutes will record the presence of each board or commission member, each city staff member, and
all guests who registered their attendance. The minutes will include all areas of discussion and identify each
speaker and the topic and, as far as possible, the key point or points that were made. The minutes will not be a
verbatim recording of all discussions. The minutes will reflect all motions made, and who made and who
seconded the motions, although it is not necessary to identify the person seconding a motion. The outcome of
each motion, including the roll call vote, if requested, will be included in the minutes. The minutes will include
the key points of any specific comments made by members for the record.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 30/500
(c) Each agenda item will be identified in the minutes by subheadings to facilitate review by the chairperson
and board or commission members. It is important that the minutes include the name and address of any
guests who address the board or commission as well as the specific subject or request presented.
(d) The minutes shall not include verbatim copies of statements nor any extraneous discussions; however,
any chairperson or board or commission member who desires to have a verbatim statement included as a part
of the minutes shall provide a typed copy of such verbatim statement to city staff prior to the presentation of
such statement. This statement will not be typed into the minutes, but will be attached to the minutes and so
noted.
(e) Copies of the minutes will be included in the agenda packets distributed to the board or commission prior
to the next regular meeting. Minutes may be amended should a member of the board or commission recognize
an incorrect statement and then may be approved by the board or commission without a motion unless a
member of the board or commission desires otherwise. After allowing time for review, the presiding officer may
state that the minutes are approved as amended or approved as distributed. Always keep in mind that the
minutes are a record of the board or commission action, even though they may differ from a tape or other
recording of the meeting.

Sec. 1.02.035 Parliamentary procedure
(a) In regular and special meetings, Robert's Rules of Order will be followed as far as is feasible.
(b) Any board or commission member may call for the question on any issue, and upon seconding by another
member, the issue to call for the question shall immediately be put to vote. Passage of the motion to address
the previous question shall terminate debate on the motion, amendment or item under discussion and action
shall be taken on that item immediately, and the chair shall move to the next item.
(c) The board or commission may agree to limit debate on any business before it. That agreement should be
formalized by a majority of the board or commission on a roll call vote prior to any deliberation on that item.
(d) Any member may request a roll call vote at any time.
(Ordinance 180-05-02-08, sec. 5, adopted 1/25/05)
Sec. 1.02.036 Decorum and debate
(a) It is imperative that the presiding officer maintain order at all times. The officer must not permit debate or
comments from any individual who has not been recognized. Interruptions must be silenced by voice, use of the
gavel or other means, and in the event of any person's failure to heed the directions of the presiding officer, the
officer may have that individual removed from the room.
(b) When a measure is presented to the board or commission for consideration, the presiding officer shall
recognize the appropriate individual to present the case. When two or more members wish to speak, the
presiding officer shall name the member who is to speak first and may direct that the other shall speak next. No
member of the board or commission shall interrupt another who is speaking except to make a point of order or
to make a point of personal privilege. No member shall speak more than five minutes in any question or
amendment to the question except as further provided in this rule.
(c) The chairperson shall not be obligated to recognize any board or commission member for a second
comment on the subject or amendment until every member wishing to speak has been allowed a first comment.
(d) Any member deciding to speak more than five minutes on any question or more than five minutes on any
amendment to the question shall be accorded the privilege only upon motion supported by a majority of the
board or commission. No member shall be permitted to interrupt while another member is speaking.
(e) No member of the board or commission shall be permitted to indulge in personalities, use language
personally offensive, question motives of other members, charge deliberate misrepresentation, or use language
tending to hold another member of the board or commission up to contempt.

(f) If a board or commission member is speaking without being recognized or otherwise violating any of the
rules of the council, the presiding officer shall, or any board or commission member may, call him or her to
order, in which case he or she shall immediately be quiet unless permitted to explain. The board or commission
shall, if appealed to, decide the case without debate. If the decision is in favor of the member called to order,
he/she shall be at liberty to proceed, but not otherwise, and if the disruption continues, he/she shall be liable to
censure or to such punishment as the board or commission deems proper consistent with state statutes or city
ordinances if applicable.
(g) In accordance with Robert's Rules of Order, the majority of the board or commission may override any
decision of the presiding officer regarding the conduct and handling of the board or commission meeting. In
order for a decision of the presiding officer to be overruled, there must be a motion, a second and a vote by the
majority of the board or commission overruling the decision of the presiding officer.

Sec. 1.02.037 Citizen participation at meetings
(a) All citizens attending any regular or special board or commission meeting will be asked to sign the visitor's
register provided. Their names, as a matter of record, will be added to the minutes of said meeting. Persons
wishing to speak to the board or commission, in addition to signing the visitor's register, must complete a
“speakers card” and indicate the subject that they wish to address. Ordinarily, one who wishes to address an
agenda item will be invited to speak when the agenda item comes up for discussion. One who wishes to
address a subject not on the agenda will have an opportunity to speak during the citizen comments agenda
item. Citizen comments are limited to three (3) minutes. A citizen may be given the time of another citizen to
speak if approved by the presiding officer; however, citizens will be limited to a total of six (6) minutes. The
chairperson or a board or commission member may make a motion to grant additional time for a citizen to
continue speaking. A majority of the board or commission members would be required to grant additional time.
(b) To maintain decorum, the chairperson, at all meetings, will ask the citizens present if they wish to speak
for or against any item on the agenda. If so, they will be given an opportunity to do so at the proper time, when
recognized by the chair. Citizen comments, when speaking on an agenda item, are limited to three (3) minutes.

ARTICLE 3.07 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION*
Sec. 3.07.001 Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods
(a) Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water
Code, section 16.315 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council does ordain as follows.
(b) Findings of fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which
cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by
uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(c) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 68/500
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(d) Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following
methods:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or
cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
(5) Prevent the placement of brush, rubbish, and debris inside the floodplain boundary;
(6) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Sec. 3.07.002 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the
meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application.
Alluvial fan flooding. Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at
the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
Apex. A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed
the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.
Appurtenant structure. A structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be
insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.
Area of future conditions flood hazard. The land area that would be inundated by the 1-percent-annual chance
(100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology.
Area of shallow flooding. A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance
rate map (FIRM) with a one-percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where
velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard. The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater

(a) No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
article by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connections with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article
shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each violation, and in addition, shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case.
(b) The city, after giving owner reasonable notice and opportunity to comply with the requirements of this
article, may abate a violation of this section by doing the necessary work to bring the property into compliance
with this section including the repair, removal, or demolition of a structure, fill, brush, or other material illegally
placed in the designated floodplain area. The costs of such work may be assessed against the property and if
property owner fails to pay, the city shall place a lien on the property for the costs incurred plus interest until the
city is paid. Such lien is inferior to any previously recorded bona fide mortgage lien attached to the real
property, but is superior to all other previously recorded judgment liens. The city council may also bring a civil
action to enforce the requirements of this section. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city council from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance
Study for Comal County, Texas and Incorporated Areas” dated September 2, 2009, with accompanying flood
insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM), and any revisions thereto, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article.
(c) Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance
with the provisions of this article.
(d) Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full
compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
(e) Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(f) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 73/500
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
(g) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare
occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural
causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the
community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or
any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(A) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(B) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(i) Showing a good and sufficient cause;
(ii) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(C) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood
elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(11) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements
and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(A) The criteria outlined in subsections (d)(1) through (9) of this section are met; and
(B) The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 76/500
(a) General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required for all new
construction and substantial improvements:
(1) All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
(2) All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and
practices that minimize flood damage;
(3) All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant
to flood damage;
(4) All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding;
(5) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(6) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
(7) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination
from them during flooding.
(b) Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section 3.07.004(b), section 3.07.005(b)(8), or subsection (c)(3) of this section, the
following provisions are required:
(1) Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of two (2) feet
above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall
submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed
in section 3.07.005(c)(1)(A), is satisfied.
(2) Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such
certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
(3) Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below
the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(A) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

subdivisions, shall be consistent with section 3.07.001(b), (c) and (d) of this article.
(2) All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions, shall meet development permit requirements of section 3.07.004(c)
and section 3.07.005(c) and the provisions of this section.
(3) Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed
development, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is

(4) All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(5) All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(d) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in section 3.07.004(b) are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and
where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures:
(A) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at
least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet
if no depth number is specified); or
(B) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base
flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
(3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain
administrator that the standards of this subsection, as proposed in section 3.07.005(c)(1)(A), are
satisfied.
(4) Require within zone AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(e) Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 3.07.004(b) are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters,
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) If subsection (e)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
(3) Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance
regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that
would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all
of the provisions required by section 65.12.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 102/500
Full cutoff fixture. Fixtures, as installed, that are designed or shielded in such a manner that all light rays
emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamps or indirectly from the fixture, are projected below a
horizontal plane running through the lowest point on the fixture where light is emitted. (See figure 1).
Glare. Intense light that results in discomfort and/or a reduction of visual performance and visibility.
Holiday lighting. Festoon type lights, limited to small individual bulbs on a string, where the spacing of bulbs is
not closer than three inches and where the output per bulb is no greater than fifteen (15) lumens.

perpendicular to the given direction. Units candelas per unit area. The luminance is the perceived brightness
that we see, the visual effect of the illuminance, reflected, emitted or transmitted from a surface.
Nonessential. Lighting that is not necessary for an intended purpose after the purpose has been served. Does
not include any lighting used for safety and/or public circulation purposes. Example: For purposes of this article,
lighting for a business sign is considered essential during business hours, however, is considered nonessential
once the business is closed.
Partially shielded. The bulb of the fixture is shielded by a translucent siding and the bulb is not visible at all.
Light may be emitted at the horizontal level of the bulb (see figure 3).
Recessed. When a light is built into a structure or portion of a structure such that the light is fully cut off and no
part of the light extends or protrudes beyond the underside of a structure or portion of a structure.
Shielded. When the light emitted from the fixture is projected below a horizontal plane running through the
lowest point of the fixture where light is emitted. The bulb is not visible with a shielded light fixture, and no light
is emitted from the sides of the fixture. Also considered a full cutoff fixture (see figure 4).

asphalt or chip seal, the director shall specify the surfacing material required to restore the
trench or patch.
(4) Construction obligations.
(A) All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted in a
manner to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. All traffic-control
set-ups, barricades, and signage shall comply with the TMUTCD. A person shall follow all
reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize such interference.
Road surfaces constructed or overlaid within the past seven (7) years shall not be cut unless
special approval is granted by the director. Road surfaces applied (chip seals) within the past
four (4) years shall not be cut unless special approval is granted by the director.
(B) The person shall be responsible for maintaining and barricading the excavation in
accordance with TMUTCD requirements until such time as final repairs are completed.
(C) When a person completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation,
or other work, the person shall promptly restore the public rights-of-way in accordance with city

Friday, unless approved by the director or the work is an emergency as defined herein.
Saturday work may be allowed at the discretion of the director.

unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty is unique to the affected property and is not self-imposed, that the
variance will not injure and will be wholly compatible with the use and permitted development of adjacent
properties, and that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of this article. A
person may request a variance from this article by filing the request with the director. Any request for variance
shall be accompanied by a written request stating the need for the variance, scaled drawings identifying the
proposed variance(s) and a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount specified in the current fee schedule adopted

Sec. 7.02.034 Appearance by defendant at trial
(a) A plea of guilty or a plea of no contest in a misdemeanor case may be made either by the defendant or
his counsel in open court; in such case, the defendant or his counsel may waive a jury, and the punishment
may be assessed by the court either upon or without evidence, at the discretion of the court.
(b) A defendant charged with a misdemeanor for which the maximum possible punishment is by fine only,
and where his or her presence is not otherwise required in open court, may, instead of the method provided in
the preceding subsection, mail to the court a plea of “guilty” or a plea of “no contest” and a waiver of jury trial.
The defendant may also request in writing that the court notify the defendant, at the address stated in the
request, of the amount of an appeal bond that the court will approve. If the court receives a plea and waiver
before the time the defendant is scheduled to appear in court, the court shall dispose of the case without
requiring a court appearance by the defendant. The court shall notify the defendant by certified mail, return
receipt requested, of the amount of any fine assessed in the case and, if requested by the defendant, the
amount of an appeal bond that the court will approve. The defendant shall pay any fine assessed or give an
appeal bond in the amount stated in the notice before the thirty-first (31st) day after receiving the notice.
(c) In a misdemeanor case arising out a moving traffic violation for which the maximum possible punishment
is by fine only, payment of a fine, or an amount accepted by the court, constitutes a finding of guilty in open
court, as though a plea of no contest had been entered by the defendant.
(d) If a written notice of a traffic violation for which the maximum possible punishment is by fine only or of a
violation relating to the manner, time and place of parking has been prepared, delivered and filed with the court
and the legible duplicate copy has been given to the defendant, the duplicate copy serves as a complaint to
which the defendant may plead guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere. If the defendant pleads not guilty to the
offense a complaint shall be filed that conforms to the requirements of article 45.01, Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1965, and that complaint serves as an original complaint. A defendant may waive the filing of a
sworn complaint and elect that the prosecution proceed on the written notice of the charged offense if the
defendant agrees in writing with the prosecution, signs the agreement and files it with the court.

This application must be made timely so as to not constitute a delay of the proceedings and shall be served by
any certified peace officer or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(d) In the event a complainant fails to appear after having been subpoenaed for trial, the case shall be
dismissed unless the court, for good cause, grants a continuance to the state.

(3) Personal recognizance bonds.

the community to insure his appearance at the time of trial and that he is not likely to commit a
similar offense if released on such recognizance. A defendant incarcerated in the county jail

Appellate Procedure govern the trial of cases before the municipal courts of record. The court may
make and enforce all rules of practice and procedure necessary to expedite the trial of cases before

subdivision and development of land. A Conveyance Plat is not a required permit or authorization for
development of any land or project.
(ii) Applicability. A Conveyance Plat may be used in lieu of a Final Plat to record the subdivision of
property in the following instances:
1. To record the remainder of a tract that is larger than five (5) acres, and that is created by
the final platting of a portion of the property, provided that the remainder is not intended for
immediate development.
2. To record the subdivision of property into parcels, five (5) acres or smaller in size, that are
not intended for immediate development, provided all required public improvements exist to
the City's current standards prior to approval and minimum frontage requirements are met. All
public rights-of-way must be dedicated and all abutting streets and utilities must be installed
and accepted by the City. Installation of on-site improvements may be delayed if development
of other tracts is not affected.
(iii) Review and Consideration. Unless otherwise specified within this Section. a Conveyance Plat
shall be processed and approved using the same timing and procedures, including recordation, as
specified for a Final Plat. Procedures to appeal a decision on a Conveyance Plat shall also be
processed and considered the same as a Final Plat.
(iv) Subsequent Filing of a Final Plat. No Final Plat processed and approved in association with a
Conveyance Plat shall be filed without the concurrent or prior filing of the associated approved
conveyance plat.
(v) Conveyance Plat Requirements.
1. No building or development permits shall be issued nor permanent utility service provided
for land that has only received approval as a Conveyance Plat; a Final Fiat must be filed for
building and development permits and for utility service. Notwithstanding the above, the Chief

(e) Parkland Dedication.
(i) Purpose: The purpose of this section is to ensure the dedication and development of parkland,
that is directly related to maintaining Quality of life for existing and future residents of the City, based
on the following findings:
1) Open Space and Recreational Areas in the form of parkland is necessary for the wellbeing
of the residents of the City.
2) A reasonable connection exists between the development of residential property and the
need for additional parkland to serve new residents of the community.
3) It is necessary and desirable to provide for dedication of land for the purposes of parkland
to support new development at the earliest stage of the development process.
4) The City of Bulverde currently has approximately 5.5 acres of improved parkland per
1,000 residents.
(ii) Applicability and Requirement. In accordance with this Section (e), the developer of a
residential subdivision or addition inside the City limits or the ETJ shall designate parkland, or pay a
fee-in-lieu, for all subdivision and development plats.
(iii) Parkland Required.
1) The amount of land required to be dedicated for parkland will be calculated at a rate of
not less than five and five-tenths (5.5) acres of parkland per 1,000 ultimate residents or an
equivalent ratio thereof. The required acreage shall be rounded to the nearest one tenth. The
following formula shall be used to determine the amount of parkland to be dedicated:
5.5 X (Number of Units) X (Persons/Units) = Acres to be dedicated 1,000
2) The number of persons per unit shall be based on the following figures:
0–6 dwelling units (DU) per acre: 3.0 persons per unit (ppu)
6–10 dwelling units (DU) per acre: 2.7 persons per unit (ppu)
10+ dwelling units (DU) per acre: 2.0 persons per unit (ppu)
3) Unless the density of multifamily or condominium developments is identified on the permit
application subject to this Subchapter, it shall be assumed that the highest density authorized
under this Chapter and Chapter 14 Zoning Code, is the development's density unless the
applicant provides by plat note. or other binding written memorialization acceptable to the
Administrator, the actual density that the project shall not exceed.
(iv) Phasing of Parkland Dedication. Dedication of parkland is required to be identified on a
Master Development Plan for residential development. Dedication and conveyance of parkland may
be provided in phases in accordance with the approved MDP; provided that the dedication for each
phase meets or exceeds the parkland dedication requirements of this Subchapter for that phase of
development.

hour trips for a development with a single land use; or (ii) three hundred (300)
peak hour trips for a development with multiple land uses.
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 241/500
B) Major. A major TIA is required for a development with a single land use
that generates more than five hundred (500) peak hour trips and for a
development with multiple land uses that generates more than three hundred
(300) peak hour trips.
C) Special. The City Manager may require a special TIA that includes
criteria tailored to the particular characteristics of the development if the City
Manager reasonably determines that the special TIA is appropriate for the
development. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the impact area,
period of analysis, analysis scenarios, growth rate assumption, phasing, and
other matters for a special TIA shall be as reasonably determined by the City
Manager based on the particular characteristics of the development.
ii) Impact Area.
A) Area of Study. The impact area to be studied shall be based on the peak
hour trips generated by the development and any other factor reasonably
required by the City Manager. The impact area shall extend to and include all
roadways within the city limits and the ETJ that will experience an increase of
at least thirty (30) peak hour trips for collectors and local streets, or at least
fifty (50) peak hour trips for secondary arterials or roadways of a higher
functional classification. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
minimum impact area for a minor TIA is the area of the development and that
area within one (1) mile of the property boundary of the development, and the
minimum impact area for a major TIA is the area of the development and that
area within one and five-tenths (1.5) miles from the property boundary of the
development.
B) Traffic Considered. In addition to the traffic to be generated by the
development, the TIA shall include and consider traffic: (1) being generated by
existing developments within the impact area; and (2) traffic that will be
generated by proposed developments within the impact area that have filed
an application for a development permit with the City, Comal County, or other
governmental entity within the impact area based on the content of such
development permit applications.
iii) Periods of Analysis; Completion year. The periods of analysis within the TIA
may include A.M., P.M., or weekend peak hour; daily traffic; any combination
thereof; or any other periods as reasonably determined by the City Manager. The
scope meeting shall also determine the completion year of the development.
iv) Analysis Scenarios. The TIA shall include analysis for the following scenarios:
(a) existing conditions; (b) completion year conditions with and without the
development; and (c) completion year with the development and proposed
mitigation. If the completion year determined at the scope meeting is more than six
(6) years from the date of the scope meeting, then the TIA shall also include
analysis of the conditions with the development and without the development for the
anticipated level of completion six (6) years from the date of the scope meeting.
v) Growth Rate Assumptions. The rate of growth for background traffic
assumptions shall include the development and shall include and consider
anticipated growth of: (a) existing developments within the impact area; and (b)
proposed developments within the impact area that have filed an application for a
development permit with the City, Comal County, or other governmental entity
based on the content of such development permit applications. Growth in
background traffic counts shall be assumed at a rate of two percent (2%) per year if
existing or proposed development is known and included in the analysis. For
property within the impact area about which planned development is unknown, the
assumed growth rate in background traffic counts shall be four percent (4%) per
year.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 242/500
vi) Phasing. If the development is proposed to be completed in phases, the
scope meeting shall determine the phasing sequence and the completion year of
each phase. The TIA shall include the anticipated roadway network and shall
include analysis for each phase developed in accordance with the phasing
sequence determined at the scope meeting. Analysis of each phase shall include
scenarios at the completion year of each phase without the development and with
the development and shall include and consider conditions resulting from prior
phases as if such prior phases were completed. If the developer proposes to alter
the phasing determined at the scope meeting, then the developer shall submit an
amended TIA as required by this Code.
vii) Other. Any other matter reasonably determined by the City Manager.
3) Preparation. The TIA shall follow standard transportation engineering practices and
processes for determining trip generation and distribution including trip generation category,
diversion assumptions, distribution assumptions, and the adequacy of the road network to
serve the proposed development, and whether off- site road dedication and improvements
should be made to mitigate the effects of the development proposed in the application.
4) Submittal Requirements.
a) Five (5) bound copies of each TIA shall be submitted to the City Manager along with
a digital version of the TIA.
b) If the roads, facilities, or other property of the State of Texas, a county, or a
municipality other than the City will be affected by the planned improvements or
mitigation measures required for the development, then the developer shall submit a
copy of any agreements with such jurisdictions related to such improvements or
mitigation measures. Such agreements shall specify the timing, conditions, and
requirements related to the proposed improvements or mitigation measures. No plat will
be approved until all agreements required by this subsection b) have been submitted.
5) Traffic Study Elements. A special TIA shall contain those elements determined at the
scoping meeting. All other TIAs shall include the following elements:
a) Existing Condition Survey. The developer shall provide a survey of the conditions
existing as of the date of the scope meeting that shall include the following.

Sec. 13.04.132 Monitoring report for permit holders
(a) Significant industrial users or other persons holding an industrial waste discharge permit shall test,
monitor and report the quality of the pollutants entering the city's collection system at a frequency not less than
every six months or as required in the industrial waste discharge permit.
(b) A composite sample shall be analyzed for the following parameters and any others required by the
industrial waste discharge permit or deemed necessary by the city manager to determine compliance with
section 13.04.031: pH, BOD, TSS, O&G, COD and TOC.
(c) Monitoring results shall be kept for a minimum of three years and shall be the basis of calculating the
wastewater treatment surcharge. Monitoring results shall be reported with each industrial wastewater discharge
permit renewal.
Sec. 13.04.133 Calculation of surcharge
(a) For those abnormal industrial wastes having a COD concentration of 2.25 or more times that of the BOD
concentration, the surcharge will be based on the COD category in lieu of the BOD category. Computations of
surcharges shall be based on the following formula:
S = 1 + [(BOD - 200) + (TSS - 200) + (4 x O&G - 200)] x 0.001
or
S = 1 + [(0.44 x COD - 200) + (TSS - 200) + (4 x O&G - 200)] x 0.001
S = Surcharge factor used to multiply the amount charged monthly for wastewater service based on flow. BOD,
TSS, O&G and COD refer to the concentration of these pollutants measured in mg/l as reported by the permit
holder or as measured by the city manager. If the values of any of these pollutants is less than the value of the
maximum concentration of normal wastewater, then these values shall be dropped from the above formula
used in computing S.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 323/500
(b) All flow rates, BOD, COD, O&G and TSS values used in determination of the surcharge of major
wastewater customers shall be reevaluated on an annual basis and shall be adjusted to reflect any increase or
decrease in wastewater treatment costs based on the previous year's experience. However, if there is a major
change in the operation to cause changes in value, the values may be increased or decreased during the
calendar year based on a study of changes or actual measurements. The permit holder may request an
adjustment of surcharge after any self-monitoring report.
Sec. 13.04.134 Analytical requirements
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
Sec. 13.04.135 Sample collection
Except as indicated as follows, a permit holder must collect wastewater samples using flow-proportional
composite collection techniques. In the event flow-proportional sampling is infeasible, the city manager may
authorize the use of time-proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
Sec. 13.04.136 Sampling point
(a) Each permit holder shall provide an accessible manhole or alternate sampling point acceptable to the city
manager at the point or points of connection to the public wastewater collection system which are suitable for
obtaining samples of the wastewater discharged. The sampling manhole shall be located on a property line
adjacent to public right-of-way or shall be accessible by easement dedicated to the public.
(b) Permit holders shall allow the city manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. The city
manager shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with
all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
Sec. 13.04.137 Recordkeeping
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and
copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent
of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the name

Sec. 13.05.050 Grease trap sizing criteria
(a) All fixtures with a potential to carry grease-bearing waste shall be plumbed to the grease trap. The first
step in determining the appropriate size of the grease trap is to calculate the total number of fixture units
connected to the trap. The following fixture unit counts shall be assigned to each different kind of fixture:
Kind of Fixture Trap and Trap Arm Size Fixture Units
3-compartment sink 1-1/2", 2" 3, 4
2-compartment sink 1-1/2" 2
Dishwasher 2" 4
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 337/500
Garbage grinder 2" 4
Wok stove 2" 4
Hand sink – 0
Mop sink – 0
Floor drains (2", 3", 4") 2", 3", 4" 2, 3, 4
Floor sinks (3", 4") 3", 4" 3, 4
Notes: Hand sinks and mop sinks are not required to be plumbed to the grease trap. For indirect waste systems
where hub drains and floor sinks are used as receptors for dishwashers, 2- and 3-compartment sinks, etc., the
fixture unit shall be twice (2x) the floor sink or hub drain fixture unit count. In such cases the fixture count for the
indirect waste source is not counted.
(b) The next step is to determine the minimum flow rating of the grease trap. This is done by multiplying the
total fixture unit count times three gallons/minute:
Grease trap flow rating = Total fixture unit count x 3 gallons/minute
(c) The minimum liquid holding capacity of the trap is calculated by multiplying the grease trap flow rating (in
gallons per minutes) times twelve minutes:
Grease trap liquid holding capacity (gallons) = Grease trap flow rating x 12 minutes
(d) Facilities using dishwashers, wok stoves, or garbage grinders are required to install 2-compartment traps
with a 12-minute total retention time.
(e) Upon approval from the city manager, fixtures receiving non-grease-bearing wastes may be drained
through a grease trap, but shall not be included for grease trap sizing (i.e., condensate for coolers).
Sec. 13.05.051 Grease trap design criteria
(a) The approved design for grease traps shall be as follows:
(1) The grease trap must be constructed in accordance with the current plumbing codes adopted
by the city, as amended, and installed in a manner acceptable to the city manager (no exceptions).
(2) The grease trap shall have two compartments.
(3) While operating at the trap's rated flow capacity, the first compartment must provide a retention
time of no less than seven minutes, and the second compartment must provide a retention time of
no less than five minutes, for a minimum total of twelve minutes.
(4) Trap inverts and vents shall be external to the compartments.
(5) The flow line to the trap (upstream of inlet invert) must be at least 3 inches above the static
water level of the tank.
(6) Similarly, the trap vent must be at least 3 inches above the static water level of the tank.
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 338/500
(7) The trap inlet must be at least 24 inches below the static water level of the tank, and the trap
outlet must be at least 12 inches above the floor of the tank.
(8) Adequate flow diffusion features must be provided to evenly distribute flow throughout the
grease trap. Examples of such features would include a flow diverter plate in the primary
compartment and “tee” piping on the tank outlet.
(9) Each trap compartment shall be accessible for cleaning and inspection purposes (no
exceptions).
(b) Exceptions to certain of these criteria may be considered for approval in conjunction with the plan review
process. In such cases, engineering drawings and supporting performance data must be submitted to and
approved by the city manager or his designee prior to grease trap installation. Metal grease traps of alternative
designs may be approved for those sites needing grease traps of 250 gallons or less.
(c) View a conceptual drawing of a typical grease trap design.
(d) View contact information for grease trap manufacturers that are familiar with these criteria. However, do
not purchase any grease trap without first verifying with the city office that the specific model will be approved
for installation.
Secs. 13.05.052–13.05.080 Reserved
Division 3. Surcharges
Sec. 13.05.081 Surcharge program
(a) Often, the wastewater discharged from businesses contains solids and organic matter at higher
concentrations in comparison to concentrations found in residential wastewater. Wastewater is considered to be
“normal strength” if it meets the wastewater quality standards established for typical residential wastewater (see
“normal values” in the table below). Wastewater that exceeds these standards is considered to be “extra
strength.” Much of the cost associated with treating wastewater is related to the amount of solids that must be
removed and the amount of oxygen that is required to stabilize and digest that organic matter in the
wastewater. As such, the treatment of wastewater from some businesses is significantly more expensive than
the treatment of typical residential wastewater.
(b) Relying on the periodic collection and analyses of wastewater samples from each permitted source of
industrial waste, the surcharge program enables the city to recover the extra costs associated with the
treatment of extra strength wastewater. Designated individualized surcharges are determined for each industrial
source. These surcharges are based on site-specific sample results for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),
chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS).
(c) Normal values:
(1) BOD less than 250 mg/l;
(2) TSS less than 250 mg/l;
(3) O&G less than 50 mg/l;
(4) COD less than 560 mg/l; and
(5) pH 5.5 to 10.0 mg/l.
(d) All users subject to a surcharge are notified by letter, and the monthly surcharge fees are applied to the
user's monthly utility bill.
Sec. 13.05.082 Calculation of surcharge
(a) For industrial wastes having a COD concentration of 2.25 or more times that of the BOD concentration,
the surcharge will be based on Formula 2 below. Computations of surcharges shall be based on the following
formulas:
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 339/500
Formula 1
S = [(BOD - 250) + (TSS - 250) + (4 x O&G - 200)] x 0.001
Formula 2
S = [(0.44 x COD - 250) + (TSS - 250) + (4 x O&G - 200)] x 0.001
Where:
S = Surcharge factor applied to wastewater charge.
(b) The surcharge is computed by multiplying the monthly wastewater charge for the facility by S.
(c) BOD, TSS, O&G, and COD refer to the annual average concentrations of those parameters measured in
mg/l as reported by the permit holder or as measured by the city manager. If the concentration of any of these
pollutants is less than the concentration of normal wastewater, then the term in the equation for that parameter
will be deleted.
(d) (1) All flow rates, BOD, COD, O&G and TSS values used in determination of the surcharge
of major wastewater customers shall be reevaluated on an annual basis and shall be adjusted to
reflect any increase or decrease in wastewater treatment costs based on the previous year's
experience. However, if there is a major change in the operation to cause changes in value, the
values may be increased or decreased during the calendar year based on a study of changes or
actual measurements.
(2) The permit holder may request an adjustment of surcharge after submittal of any selfmonitoring
report.

prior to the issuance of the construction permit. A construction permit application fee is not required
for city-initiated projects that require utility companies to place, replace, or alter facilities on, in, under
or over the public rights-of-way.
(2) Construction permit application. With such application, applicants shall submit to the director
written applications identifying the applicant and all affiliates that may have physical control of
facilities within the public rights-of-way, with plans of the proposed work, general description of the
services to be provided, a construction schedule, and a general description of the expected impact

holders of a state-issued certificate of franchising authority to provide cable or video services under chapter 66,
Texas Utilities Code, prior to placing, replacing, or altering facilities in, on or over the public rights-of-way, must
obtain separate municipal authorization from the city. For use of the public rights-of-way, all users of the public
rights-of-way shall compensate the city on the value of the rights-of-way used, being typically either on a gross
receipts basis or on a linear foot basis, to the fullest extent allowed by law.
(c) Franchise agreements. Any utility company with a current and unexpired consent, franchise, agreement
or other authorization from the city (“grant”) to use the public rights-of-way that is in effect at the time this article,
public rights-of-way management ordinance, is adopted, shall continue to operate under and comply with that
grant (except to the extent the police power regulations in such grant are inconsistent with this article, in which
event, this article will control) until the grant expires or until it is terminated by mutual agreement of the city and
the utility company, or is terminated as otherwise provided for in law.
(d) Prerequisites to issuance of construction permit.
(1) Each utility company must register with the city. In order for the city to know which utility

Sec. 13.06.006 Construction obligations
A utility company is subject to reasonable police power regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way
in connection with the excavation, construction, installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, alteration,
removal, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way, pursuant to the city's rights as a
custodian of public property based upon the city's historic rights under state and federal laws. Such regulations
include, but are not limited to the following:
(1) At the city's request, a utility company shall furnish the city accurate and complete information
relating to the excavation, construction, installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, alteration,
removal, maintenance or repair of facilities performed by the utility company in the public rights-ofway,
as set forth herein and in the DACS. Information provided to the city pursuant to this subsection
may be designated by the providing utility company as confidential and will be kept confidential by
the city to the extent allowed by law.
(2) A utility company shall perform excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way
in accordance with all applicable city ordinances, state statutes, state and federal regulations and
other laws. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so
as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. Any facility placed within the
public rights-of-way that is attached in any manner above ground shall either be placed on existing
poles or equipment or be attached in accordance with the National Electrical Safety Code. A utility
company shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any
such interference.
(3) A utility company shall be required to utilize trenchless technology wherever the proposed
construction crosses any portion of a public sidewalk, public street, public or private driveways, or
within the drip line of a protected, specimen, majestic, historic tree, or replacement tree, or group
thereof, as those terms are defined in chapter 10 of this Code; provided, however, that in exceptional
cases where particular field conditions prevent the use of trenchless technology, the director has the
discretion to grant a waiver of this requirement. Nothing in this paragraph shall exempt a utility
company from complying with any other requirement related to the protection of protected,
specimen, majestic, historic trees, or replacement trees.
(4) A utility company shall use its best efforts to coordinate construction and installation of
facilities, including collocation of poles for aerial facilities and joint trenching, with any other utility
companies which may be constructing in and along the same public rights-of-way. The director may
mandate such coordination to the fullest extent allowed by law.
(5) To the extent known, plans for ongoing repair, maintenance and improvements that involve
cutting into paved city roads or streets shall be submitted to the city on an annual basis, no later
than April 1st of each year, and updated based upon any changes. This does not require any
proprietary information, such as equipment or customer specific information. Such information may
be designated confidential, and to the extent allowed by law, will be kept confidential by the city.
Alternatively, a utility company may meet with the appropriate representative of the city each
calendar quarter to provide such plans to the extent known.
(6) Construction permits.
(A) Except as provided in subsections (6)(C) and (6)(D) below, all utility companies must
obtain a construction permit before performing any new construction or replacement,
upgrading, excavation, installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, alteration, removal,
maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way. The permit will be in the name of
the utility company who will own the facilities to be constructed. The permit must be completed
and signed by a lawful representative of the owner of the facilities to be constructed. Failure to
obtain a required construction permit will subject the utility company to a stop-work order from
the city and enforcement action pursuant to this code.
(B) Except as provided in subsections (6)(C) and (6)(D) below, a utility company must
submit an application for a construction permit at least seven days prior to the proposed
commencement of work in the request and must obtain the construction permit 48 hours prior
to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, alteration,
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 343/500
removal, maintenance or repair of the utility company's facilities. The aforesaid time
requirements may be waived or altered by the city for good cause shown by the applicant.
(C) No permit is required for the installation of facilities necessary to provide primary or
regular service directly to a customer's property or performing routine repair or maintenance of
existing facilities, unless the utility company's activities require:
(i) The breaking of the asphalt, concrete or similar surface of the public rights-of-way;
(ii) The installation of a pole within the public rights-of-way;
(iii) The installation of an appurtenance extending to or above the surface of the public
rights-of-way within two feet of a curb, sidewalk, or driveway, or within public rights-ofway
containing roadways without barrier curbs;
(iv) Excavation greater than three feet in depth or ten feet in length within the public
rights-of-way;
(v) The closure of a traffic lane; or
(vi) Boring within the public rights-of-way.
(D) No permit is required before performing emergency repair or maintenance; provided,
however, that if such emergency repair or maintenance requires breaking of the asphalt,
concrete or similar surface of the public rights-of-way, the utility company performing such work
shall notify the director immediately, and in no event later than two hours, after the
commencement of breaking of the asphalt, concrete or similar surface. Any utility company
performing emergency repair or maintenance in the public rights-of-way that does not require
the breaking of the asphalt, concrete or similar surface of the rights-of-way shall provide the
director with notice of any work performed by the next business day from the commencement
of such work. A utility company shall provide the director with a written, reasonably detailed
description of emergency repair or maintenance work performed in the public rights-of-way and
an updated map of any facilities that were relocated within 20 business days of completion of
such work. In addition, the utility company shall comply with the requirements of this article for
the restoration, replacement or repair of the public rights-of-way.
(E) If non-pavement excavation required for the installation of facilities necessary to initiate
service to a customer's property or for routine repair or maintenance cannot be backfilled at the
end of a business day, then the utility company performing the excavation shall fence off the
excavated area. If such non-pavement excavation cannot be backfilled by the following
business day, the excavation must be fenced off and a permit application must be submitted to
the city the next business day.
(F) Insurance and bonding will be required in accordance with this article.
(G) If the utility company fails to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of issuance,
the permit shall expire unless extended by the city upon a showing of good cause. Upon
expiration of a permit, a utility company shall be required to obtain another permit pursuant to
the requirements of this article.
(H) The permit shall state to whom it is issued, location of work, location of facilities, dates
and times work is to take place, and any other reasonable conditions set out by the director.
(I) No permit shall be issued until the utility company requesting the permit provides the
director, in the format specified by the city, the following:
(i) The completed application with the approximate location and proposed routing of
new construction or reconstruction of all facilities at least seven days before beginning
construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of
the public rights-of-way, unless otherwise approved by the director and the applicant's
plan for right-of-way construction or reconstruction. A utility company may not begin
construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 344/500
construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved
in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due
consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and
routing. In the event a utility company is required to commence construction within less
than seven days in order to comply with service objectives set by the Public Utility
Commission of Texas, the utility company shall provide notification of such requirement to
the city with the completed application and the utility company may commence
construction no sooner than one business day following submission of the application to
the city; in the event the city subsequently reasonably withholds approval, the utility
company shall adjust its application and any associated installed facilities to comply with
the city's requirements. Furthermore, the utility company shall provide personnel to
respond to the city's requests regarding the application on a reasonably continual basis
for the business day after the time the application is submitted.
(ii) For review, one set of construction plans in an electronic format acceptable to the
director, or two hard copy sets of construction plans. Upon approval of the application by
the director, three sets of construction plans each with a copy of the approved application
shall be delivered in hard copy to the director. Construction plans shall clearly display
footages, reference points, tie-ins and proposed alignments of items being constructed. It
is recommended that non-structure construction plans be drawn to scale, but if not, they
shall be of a size and of sufficient detail that is reasonably clear and readable as
determined by the director. Construction plans for structures must be prepared on a
recognized scale no smaller than one inch = 50 feet, unless otherwise approved by the
director, and must be sealed by a professional engineer to the extent required by The
Texas Engineering Practice Act, Article 3271a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes, as
amended or recodified.
(iii) Except as provided below, the construction plans shall show all features as set
forth herein. For utility construction involving the placement of new or replacement poles
or utilizing underground trenchless technology, the construction plans shall show all
features located within seven feet on either side of the proposed facilities. For utility
construction utilizing excavated trenches, the construction plans shall show all features
located within seven feet on either side of the excavation. The features that are required
to be shown on the plans include existing underground and aerial wires or conduits,
ducts, poles, wires, pipes, sewerage, water lines, and cables as well as their ownership;
traffic signal and streetlight poles; fire hydrants; driveways; curbs, inlets and drains;
sidewalks and wheelchair ramps; and trees and large shrubs. If the nature of the
proposed facilities or specific site conditions warrants it, the director may increase the
above distance to 50 feet. For construction within rights-of-way containing streets, roads,
or highways, drawings shall show horizontal dimensions from the curb line or edge of
pavement, or if a sidewalk exists, from the edge of sidewalk when not on the road or
street side of the sidewalk, provided however, the director may require drawings to show
dimensions from specific lines or features when a more uniform alignment would be
achieved as determined by the director. Within other rights-of-ways, drawings shall show
horizontal dimensions from property lines or easement lines. Drawings shall show
elevation data including depth of installation and separation distances from other utilities.
If typicals are used, they shall reference the station numbers for which they are to be
applied. Traffic control plans shall be in conformance with the latest revision of the Texas
Manual on Uniform Traffic-Control Devices (TMUTCD). The director may accept
construction plans which deviate from the standards contained herein, so long as good
cause is shown, and such a deviation is applied in a competitively neutral,
nondiscriminating manner. Regardless of the above, features other than those to be
utilized by the utility company for its construction need not be shown for projects that
entail the installation of additional or replacement equipment on existing poles, or the
installation of additional ducts, inner ducts, or cable within existing conduit, and which do
not entail either the installation of new poles or conduit, or the alteration of the surface or
subsurface of the public rights-of-way.
(iv) Location of all public rights-of-way and utility easements which applicant plans to
use.

transformers, pedestals, etc. including depth located in public rights-of-way.
(ix) Handhole and manhole typical of the type of manholes and handholes applicant
plans to use or access.
(x) Complete legend of drawings submitted by the applicant.
(xi) Name, address and telephone numbers of the contractor or subcontractor who will
perform the actual construction, including the name and telephone number of an
individual with the contractor who will be available at all times during construction. Such
information shall be provided as soon as it is known by the utility company, but in any
event prior to the commencement of construction and shall be amended by the utility
company as necessary during the course of the work by written notification to the
director.
(xii) The construction and installation methods to be employed for the protection of
existing structures, fixtures, and facilities within or adjacent to the right-of-way and the
dates and times work will occur.
(xiii) A copy of any permit or approval issued by federal or state authorities for work in
federal or state right-of-way located within the city, if requested by the director.
(J) The director shall have the authority to place reasonable conditions and restrictions on
the permit in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, as well as
for the protection of property located within or adjacent to the right-of-way.
(K) All construction and installation in the public rights-of-way shall be accomplished by the
utility company in strict compliance with the permit for the facilities. The director shall be
provided access to the work and to such further information as may reasonably be required to
ensure compliance with the permit. No deviation whatsoever from the permit shall be allowed
without the director's approval in writing of a permit amendment. When conditions warrant,
such permit amendment may be accomplished with a written amendment in the field executed
by the director or the director's authorized designee.
(L) The director may inspect the site to ensure compliance with the permit and shall conduct
a final inspection of the site and provide final approval of the work permitted. The director shall
make a reasonable effort to complete the final inspection within five days following notification
by the utility company that the project has been completed. Upon final inspection, if the director
finds that the permit has not been complied with, the director will provide written notice to the
utility company regarding the work to be performed in order to obtain final approval.
(M) Copies of the approved construction permit and approved engineering plans shall be
maintained at the construction site and made available for inspection by the director at all
times when construction or installation work is occurring.
(N) All construction or installation work authorized by permit must be completed in the time
specified in the construction permit. If the work cannot be completed in the specified time
periods, the permittee may request an extension from the director. The utility company shall
notify the city's contact specified on the approved permit application at least one business day
and no more than three business days prior to beginning the work authorized by the permit, or
prior to continuing the work if work has been suspended for more than three business days.
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 346/500
(O) Requests for permits will be approved or disapproved by the director within a reasonable
time of receiving all the necessary information.
(P) The director may require a preconstruction meeting with the permittee and construction
contractor.
(Q) If the director declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens
and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, or requests the relocation
of a utility company's facilities in accordance with this article, a utility company shall remove or
abate the utility company's facilities by the deadline provided in the director's request. The
utility company and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of
service. A construction permit application fee is not required for city-initiated relocation
projects. If the utility company, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove, relocate
or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the utility company, without paying
compensation to the utility company and without the city incurring liability for damages. Upon
receipt of an invoice from the city, the utility company shall promptly reimburse the city for all
costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice.
(R) In determining whether any requirement under this article is unreasonable or unfeasible,
the director shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the
utility company to an unreasonable increase in risk or service interruption, or to an
unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable delay in construction or
in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable technical or economic burden, and
the utility's obligations as a provider of last resort pursuant to the provisions of the Texas
Utilities Code.
(S) A utility company issued a permit pursuant to this article shall, at all times, employ the
standard of care attendant to the risks involved to prevent actions, failures and accidents that
may cause damage, injury or nuisance to persons, the public, the facilities of other utility
companies, or to any city structures or structures owned by other utility companies located in
the public rights-of-way. A utility company issued a permit pursuant to this article shall observe
all federal and state statutes and regulations and all applicable city ordinances and safety
codes. A utility company issued a permit pursuant to this article shall keep and maintain its
facilities in a safe and suitable condition, and in good order and repair.
Sec. 13.06.007 Restoration and repair
(a) Within 14 days of completion of replacement, upgrading, excavation, construction, installation, expansion,
reconstruction, relocation, alteration, removal, maintenance or repair of facilities or other work in the public
rights-of-way, a utility company shall temporarily restore and repair the public rights-of-way. Within 30 calendar
days after completion of work in the public rights-of-way, the utility company shall permanently restore, replace,
relay and repair the surface, base, curbs, drainage systems, irrigation systems, landscape treatment, trees,
shrubs, sidewalks, mailboxes, walls, and other city facilities and infrastructure located on, in or under any public
rights-of-way that has been excavated, altered or damaged by reason of the replacement, upgrading,
excavation, construction, installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, alteration, removal, maintenance or
repair of the utility company's facilities to the condition the public rights-of-way were in before the construction
or better and must receive final approval from the director.
(b) Restoration to the condition the public rights-of-way were in before the construction shall be to the
reasonable satisfaction of the director. The restoration shall include, but shall not be limited to:
(1) Restoration of all landscaping and sprinkler systems including replacing all ground cover
damaged during work with the same type of ground cover or better by sodding, seeding, or as
directed by the director;
(2) Installation of all manholes and handholes, as required;
(3) Backfilling and compaction of all bore pits, potholes, trenches or any other excavation sites,
unless other safety requirements are approved by the director;
(4) Smoothing of all trenches and ruts, and restoration of the surface to the lines and grades
existing prior to the work being performed, unless otherwise approved by the director;
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 347/500
(5) Restoration of excavation site including compaction in accordance with city specifications.
(c) All locate flags associated with the permitted utility project shall be removed during the cleanup process
by the applicant or its contractor at the completion of the work.
(d) Upon a showing of good cause, the city may, at its sole discretion, extend the time for restoration and
repair of the public rights-of-way under this section. Unless the utility company provides a recent photograph or
a video tape of the public rights-of-way before the construction, the condition of the public rights-of-way before
construction should be presumed in good condition, subject only to reasonable wear and tear, as determined by
the director.
(e) A utility company shall restore any right-of-way markers or monuments disturbed or destroyed during
construction activities within 30 days after construction has ceased. The utility company shall furnish three sets
of drawings, blueline or blackline, detailing the restored monumentation. State plane coordinates shall be
shown for all monumentation (existing or restored). The drawings shall be signed (original signature), sealed
and certified by a registered professional land surveyor, and delivered to the director for approval, no later than
30 days after construction has ceased.
(f) Should the director reasonably determine that additional restoration, replacement or repair work is
required to restore any public rights-of-way to a condition that is at least as good as it was in before
construction, the city shall provide written notice to the utility company of the need to perform such additional
restoration, replacement or repair work. The utility company must begin such additional restoration,
replacement or repair within ten business days of receipt of written notice and diligently pursue such work to
completion. In the event repairs have not been initiated during such ten-business day period or the utility
company ceases to diligently pursue such work to completion, or the work is not performed to the reasonable
satisfaction of the director, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been
disturbed by the utility company. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the utility company shall reimburse the
city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the invoice. The city may, for good cause,
extend the ten-business-day period.
(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing in subsection (f) of this section, if the director determines that the failure of
the utility company to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public,
the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts, after emergency notice has been provided, to
the extent reasonable under the circumstances, and the utility company failed to respond within a reasonable
time specified by the city. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the utility company shall reimburse the city for
all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice.
Sec. 13.06.008 Construction standards
(a) Once a permit is issued, a utility company, or its representative, shall notify the director and any other
designated departments of the city at least 24 hours in advance that construction in the public rights-of-way is
ready to proceed. Information signs (at least three feet by three feet in size) stating the identity of the contractor
doing the work, their telephone number, and the utility company's identity and telephone number shall be
placed at the location where construction is to occur no earlier than five business days and no later than 24
hours prior to the beginning of work in the public rights-of-way and shall continue to be posted at the location
during until the work is completed. An informational sign will be posted on each end of the public rights-of-way
100 feet before the construction location commences. Information signs shall be located in such a manner that
does not adversely affect vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
(b) All construction shall he in conformity with all city codes and applicable local, state and federal laws.
(c) Erosion control measures and advance warning signs, markers, cones and barricades must be in place
before work begins. A utility company may be required to show proof of engineered plans relating to stormwater
and erosion when applicable or a letter stating the utility company is not required by law to obtain such plans.
The utility company shall be responsible for stormwater management and erosion control that complies with
city, state and federal guidelines, as applicable. Requirements shall include, but shall not be limited to, silt
fencing around any excavation that will be left overnight, silt fencing in erosion areas until reasonable
vegetation is established, barricade fencing around open excavations, and wire backed silt fencing in high
erosion areas. Upon request, the utility company may be required to furnish documentation submitted or
received from the federal or state governments.
(d) The utility company shall ensure that dust control measures are implemented at the site.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 348/500
(e) Except in the case of an emergency, or as otherwise approved by the director:
(1) Lane closures on major thoroughfares will be limited to between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.,
unless the director grants prior approval. All traffic control devices shall conform to the TMUTCD,
provided that the city may dictate restrictions due to rush hour traffic, unique events, or other
conditions that may warrant such restrictions.
(2) Working hours in the public rights-of-way are limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. to 6:00
p.m. Monday through Friday. When work on Saturdays, Sundays or city-observed holidays is
allowed as provided in subsection (e)(4) below, working hours are limited to the hours between 9:00
a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Saturdays and city-observed holidays, and between noon and 6:00 p.m. on
Sundays. Work to be performed after 6:00 p.m. must be approved in writing by the director in
advance. Regardless of the above, work before sunrise or after sunset is prohibited unless
appropriate provisions for night work as approved by the director are implemented.
(3) Directional boring is permitted only Monday through Friday 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., unless
approved in advance.
(4) Work on Saturdays, Sundays and city-observed holidays is generally discouraged; however,
such work may be authorized when the director determines that the work is in the best interest of the
public. The director's determination shall be based on factors including but not limited to the
following: (i) the work will cause less disruption to pedestrian or vehicular traffic or the public than
that caused on a weekday; (ii) the availability and necessity of city staff to inspect or otherwise
administer the provisions of this section with respect to the work; and (iii) any special activities
planned or occurring at the site of the work. Any work in the public rights-of-way performed on
Saturdays or city-observed holidays must be approved in writing by the director at least 48 hours in
advance. Any work in the public rights-of-way performed on Sundays must be approved in writing by
the director at least 72 hours in advance.
(f) Without affecting the legal relationship between the utility company and its contractors, a utility company is
responsible for the workmanship and any damages by a contractor or subcontractor. A responsible
representative of the utility company will be available to the director at all times during construction.
(g) The utility company or contractor or subcontractor shall notify the director immediately of any damage to
other utilities, either city-owned or privately owned.
(h) It is city's policy to discourage the cutting of street and sidewalk pavements and the blocking of sidewalks
or other pedestrian paths; however, when a street or sidewalk pavement cut is required, prior approval must be
obtained in accordance with this article and all requirements provided in this article shall be followed. When a
sidewalk or other pedestrian path must be blocked or cut, temporary measures shall be provided to
accommodate pedestrian traffic as approved by the director. Such measures may include the construction of a
temporary pedestrian pathway in accordance with state accessibility standards. Repair of all street and
sidewalk pavement cuts must be made promptly to avoid safety hazards to vehicle and pedestrian traffic. All
cutting of street and sidewalks shall be performed, if at all, according to the following:
(1) Backfilling. All excavations within a right-of-way and not under surfacing shall be back-filled by
tamping in six-inch horizontal layers, ponding or jetting. All surface materials shall be removed from
the right-of-way and the excavation finished flush with surrounding natural ground. For all
excavations under surfacing, back-fill material shall be stabilized with Portland cement and mixed in
a concrete mixer or transit mix equipment. If soil is used, it shall be sandy material free from lumps
or clods, and shall be stabilized with two sacks of cement per cubic yard of soil. If sand and gravel
are used, pit run material will be allowed, and it shall be stabilized with one sack of cement per cubic
yard. Backfill may be mechanically tamped in a moist condition or water added to provide a freeflowing
mixture. Stabilized backfill shall be completed to a point 1-1/2 inches below existing finished
grade and the remaining 1-1/2 inches shall be replaced with hot mix asphaltic concrete; hot or cold
lay. All excavation in gravel streets or streets under construction shall be back-filled with select
material by tamping six-inch horizontal layers to finished grade, then the top six inches of back-fill
shall be removed and replaced with one-inch road base, tamped or rolled to 95 percent of density.
(2) Scoring. All paved surfaces shall be cut or scored in a straight line before any digging has
begun to prevent breaking the seal of the paved area not to be disturbed.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 349/500
(3) Excavations along highways. Excavations along highways shall be performed in compliance
with Texas Department of Transportation and other city specifications and in such a manor that all
excavated material is kept off the lanes of travel that ale open during such excavation'.
(4) Protection of public and private property. The permittee shall, at all times and at its sole cost
and expense, preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper
foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where it is necessary to enter upon
private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protecting measures, the permittee shall first
obtain consent from the owner of such private property for such purpose and if he cannot obtain
such consent, the director may waive the requirement to protect private property. The permittee
shall, at his own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to
be damaged during the progress of the excavation work, and shall be responsible for all damage to
public or private property or highways resulting from his failure to properly protect and carry out such
work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, said area
shall be re-seeded or the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
back-filled as required in this section. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a
manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as
possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even
temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas without first obtaining the consent
of the appropriate city department or city official having supervision of such property.
(i) Installation of facilities must not interfere with city utilities or the maintenance of them, in particular, without
limitation, gravity dependent facilities.
(j) New facilities must be installed to a depth approved by the director, in accordance with DACS.
(k) All directional boring shall have a locator place bore marks and depths while bore is in progress. A locator
shall place marks at each stem with paint dots and depths at least every other stem.
(l) Utility companies working in the public rights-of-way are responsible for obtaining line locates from all
affected utilities or others with facilities in the public rights-of-way prior to any excavation. Use of the
Geographic Information System or the plans of record does not satisfy this requirement.
(m) The utility company will be responsible for verifying the location, both horizontal and vertical, of all
facilities which might possibly interfere with the construction activities. When required by Texas Utilities Code §
251.001 (the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act), the utility company shall verify
locations by potholing, hand digging, or other acceptable method prior to any excavation or boring.
(n) Placement of all manholes and handholes must be approved in advance by the director. Handholes or
manholes will not be located in sidewalks unless approved by the director.
(o) Locate flags or marks shall not be removed from a location while facilities are being constructed.
(p) When the pumping of water or mud is required during construction, such water or mud shall be contained
in accordance with applicable city ordinances and federal and state law and the directives of the director.
(q) All streets and sidewalks shall be kept clean and clear of rocks, mud, dirt, debris, etc. to the extent
practicable and any street or sidewalk shall be cleaned upon notification by the director. If any streets or
sidewalks are not kept clean, the director may suspend work.
(r) Except in emergency situations, work within a roadway shall not be initiated or conducted during
inclement weather involving foggy, rainy or icy conditions.
Sec. 13.06.009 Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy
(a) In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority over all other users of the public rightsof-
way. To the fullest extent allowed by law, the city reserves the right to:
(1) Lay sewer, gas, water facilities, and any other pipe lines or cables and conduits;
(2) Do underground and overhead work, including attachments;
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 350/500
(3) Require restructuring or changes in the city's aerial facilities in, across, along, over or under a
public street, alley or public rights-of-way that may be occupied by a utility company; and
(4) Change the curb, route or grade of sidewalks and streets.
(b) The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public
rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the
extent the city can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users as
allowed under state or federal law. As a priority, each user of the public rights-of-way will be allowed one
alignment on one side of the street for placement of its facilities, provided there is adequate space available. In
the event an additional alignment or both sides of the street has been requested by a user, the director will
grant such request, provided there is adequate space available and the requestor has demonstrated the
financial or technical impracticability of the use of the requestor's single alignment or use of only one side of the
street.
(c) If the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley, or
public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the previously
authorized user of the public rights-of-way.
(d) If the director gives written notice, the utility company shall, at its own expense (unless provided
otherwise by state law or a franchise), temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position
of the utility company's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days, except in circumstances
that require additional time as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the utility
company. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, relocate, change or alter, the director
will confer with the utility company before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The
director shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is
reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city governmental
public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This article shall not be construed to prevent a utility company's
recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or
removal.
(e) If the utility company fails to relocate facilities in the time required by the director in this article, the utility
company shall be subject to liability to the city for such delay. In addition, the city may relocate the utility
company's facilities after providing reasonable notice to the affected utility company. Upon receipt of an invoice
from the city, the utility company shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city for such relocation
within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice.
(f) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (d) of this section, the director and the utility company may agree
in writing to different time frames than those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such a
change.
(g) A utility company may trim trees or other vegetation in or over the public rights-of-way as needed for the
safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its facilities. All tree trimming shall be performed in
accordance with the city's tree protection and preservation ordinance, as amended. The utility company, its
contractor or agent, shall remove such trimmings within 72 hours following routine maintenance or within ten
business days following emergency activities. If the utility company fails to remove all debris resulting from
trimming trees or other vegetation, the city may notify the utility company of such failure. If the utility company
fails to remove such debris within five business days from receipt of notice from the city, the city may remove
the debris or have it removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the utility company shall reimburse the
city for all costs incurred within 30 working days.
(h) A utility company shall temporarily remove, raise or lower its aerial facilities to permit the moving of
houses or other bulky objects. The utility company shall meet with the party or parties requesting the temporary
rearrangement within 72 hours of receipt of notice from the city to discuss the scheduling and cost. The
expense of these temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and benefiting from
the temporary rearrangements. The utility company may require prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the
party requesting the temporary move.
(i) In the event a utility company's use of its facilities is discontinued or abandoned, the utility company shall
notify the city and thereafter shall forthwith remove its facilities from the public rights-of-way unless specifically
permitted to remain, and on the removal thereof shall restore, repair or reconstruct the public rights-of-way
where such removal has occurred, to the same condition as existed prior to the removal. In the event of failure,
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 351/500
neglect or refusal of the utility company, after 30 days' notice by the director to remove such facilities as
directed or repair the public rights-of-way upon removal of its facilities, the city may do such work or cause it to
be done, and the reasonable cost thereof as determined by the city shall be paid by the utility company and
collection may be made by court action or otherwise. There is a presumption of discontinued use if the facilities
or related appurtenances are not used for a period of one year. Such presumption may be rebutted by the utility
company by documentation of use or by documentation of future use as a utility company designated as a
provider of last resort under the Texas Utilities Code.
Sec. 13.06.010 Insurance and bond requirements
(a) Insurance.
(1) A utility company shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts provided in subsection
(a)(2) of this section with an insurance company licensed to do business in the state, with an AM
Best rating of at least A-. A utility company shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the director
at the time of the request for construction permits and prior to any commencement of work. The
city's current insurance forms and requirements may be obtained from the director.
(2) A utility company shall furnish to the director, at no cost to the city, a certificate of insurance
showing proof of liability insurance in the total amount of $1,000,000.00.
(3) The insurance certificate required under subsection (a)(2) of this section shall:
(A) Include a cancellation provision in which the insurance company is required to provide
the city a 30-day written notice before a cancellation, nonrenewal, reduction of policy limits, or
other material change; and
(B) Provide that notice of claims related to public rights-of-way construction shall be
provided to the director by certified mail.
(4) The coverage must be on an occurrence basis and must include coverage for personal injury,
contractual liability, premises liability, medical damages, underground, explosion and collapse
hazards.
(5) An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city attorney
approval. A utility company shall immediately advise the city of actual or potential litigation that may
develop and may affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify.
(6) The policy clause “other insurance” shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the
policy.
(7) A utility company shall pay premiums and assessments for the insurance required under this
article. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. A company that
issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or
assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a utility company must provide that the issuing company
waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with damage
covered by the policy.
(8) The city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the state, or letters written by the
utility company in those instances where the state does not issue such certificates, which provide
the same coverage as required herein. The city has the right to require proof of financial stability
prior to accepting the proof of self-insurance, provided that defense of the city shall be comparable
as provided by an insurance carrier. The defense and claims processing required of holders of a
state-issued certificate of franchising authority to provide cable or video services shall be in
accordance with chapter 66, Texas Utilities Code.
(b) Bonds.
(1) Unless otherwise provided for by a utility company's valid franchise or prohibited by law, the
director shall require reasonable bonding requirements of a utility company, as are required of other
entities that place facilities in the public rights-of-way. Such bonding amounts will be reasonably
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 352/500
determined by the director depending on several factors as to public safety and risk of harm to
persons and property. Such factors include, but are not limited to:
(A) The nature of the construction project;
(B) The type of facility; and
(C) Past construction history of the utility company in the city as to any damage claims,
repairs and timeliness of construction.
(2) The utility company shall file an annual surety bond which will be valid each year construction
will occur through one full year after the completion of the construction from a surety company
authorized to do business in the state, and must be on forms provided by the city. Such surety bond
will be in the amount of the estimated cost to restore the public rights-of-way for the work anticipated
to be done in that year and to relocate facilities pursuant to this article. If the director determines that
the annual surety bond on file is insufficient to restore the public rights-of-way and to relocate
facilities related to a specific project for which a permit application has been filed, then the director
may require the utility company to file an additional surety bond for such project.
(3) The city may either waive or reduce the amount of the bond in the event the utility company
provides written documentation as to reserves available to compensate the city for damages, and
has a two-year history of no claims, or damages to city property, or of prompt payment on such
claims. Further, notwithstanding subsection (b)(1) of this section, a bond shall not be required of a
utility company that can demonstrate a record of at least four years of work in the public rights-ofway
in the city and to the extent applicable, in all other municipalities it has performed such work,
free of unsatisfied claims. No bonds for aerial construction will be required of holders of a stateissued
certificate of franchising authority to provide cable or video services, in accordance with
chapter 66, Texas Utilities Code.
(c) Alternate compliance methods. The above requirements may be met by utilities with a current franchise or
license if their current franchise or license adequately provides for insurance or bonds or provides an indemnity
in favor of city.
Sec. 13.06.011 System map
(a) All utility companies who have facilities in the public rights-of-way existing as of the adoption date of the
ordinance from which this article is derived shall provide a system map of their facilities to the city in a digital
format commercially available, nonproprietary software no later than two years after the passage of this article,
unless the utility company demonstrates an economic impracticality to provide such system map in the above
format. An updated system map shall also be provided to the city on an annual basis to include new facilities.
(b) Information provided to the city pursuant to this section may be designated confidential by the providing
utility company and will be kept confidential by the city to the extent allowed by law.
Sec. 13.06.012 Improperly installed facilities
(a) Any entity doing work in the public rights-of-way shall properly install, repair, upgrade and maintain
facilities.
(b) Facilities will be considered to be improperly installed, repaired, upgraded or maintained if:
(1) The installation, repair, upgrade or maintenance endangers people or property or constitutes a
threat to public health and safety;
(2) The facilities do not meet applicable federal, state and city codes and regulations;
(3) The facilities are not capable of being located using reasonable methods; or
(4) The facilities are not installed in accordance with the approved permit issued by the director.
Sec. 13.06.013 Revocation of permit
7/13/2019 https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 353/500
If a utility company violates the terms and conditions contained herein, then the director may revoke any permit
held by such utility company.
Sec. 13.06.014 Appeal from revocation or denial of permit
Appeal from revocation or denial of a permit or from the decision of the director shall be to the city manager.
Appeal shall be filed with the city secretary within 10 days from the date of the decision being appealed.
Sec. 13.06.015 Indemnity
(a) Except as to certificated telecommunications providers, as provided in chapter 283, Texas Local
Government Code, and holders of a state-issued certificate of franchising authority to provide cable or video
services, in accordance with chapter 66, Texas Utilities Code, each utility company placing facilities in the public
rights-of-way agrees to promptly defend, indemnify and hold the city harmless from and against all damages,
costs, losses, claims, demands, suits, causes of action, judgments or expenses arising out of, incident to,
concerning or resulting from the negligent or willful acts or omissions of the utility company, its agents,
employees, and subcontractors, in the performance of activities pursuant to or authorized under this article for
the repair, replacement or restoration of the city's property, equipment, materials, structures and facilities that
are damaged, destroyed or found to be defective; damage to or loss of the property of any utility company,
including but not limited to the utility company, its agents, officers, employees and subcontractors, city's agents,
officers and employees, and third parties; and death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services, or loss of
income or wages to any person, including, but not limited to, the agents, officers and employees of the utility
company, utility company's subcontractors and city, and third parties.
(b) Upon commencement of any suit, proceeding at law or in equity against the city relating to or covering
any matter covered by the indemnity in this section for which the utility company is obligated to indemnify and
hold the city harmless, or to pay said final judgment and costs, as the case may be, the city shall give the utility
company reasonable notice of such suit or proceeding. The utility company shall promptly provide a defense to
any such suit or suits, including any appellate proceedings brought in connection therewith, and pay any final
judgment or judgments that may be rendered against the city by reason of such damage suit. Upon failure of
the utility company to comply with the provisions of this article, after reasonable notice to the city, the city shall
have the right to defend the same and in addition to being reimbursed for any such judgment that may be
rendered against the city, together with all court costs incurred therein, the utility company shall promptly
reimburse the city for attorney's fees, including those employed by the city in such case or cases, as well as all
expenses incurred by the city by reason of undertaking the defense of such suit or suits, whether such suit or
suits are successfully defended, settled, compromised, or fully adjudicated against the city.
(c) The indemnity provisions in this section shall not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the
city, its officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors.
(d) The provisions of this section are solely for the benefit of the city and are not intended to create or grant
any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.
(e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, a utility company shall pay all expenses incurred by the city in
defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties provided in this article. These expenses shall include
all out-of-pocket expenses such as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and shall also include the
reasonable value of any services rendered by any employees of the city. In the event the city is compelled to
undertake the defense of any such suit by reason of a utility company's failure to provide a defense as
hereinabove provided, the city shall have full right and authority to make or enter into any settlement or
compromise of such adjudication as the city council shall deem in the best interest of the city, without the prior
approval or consent of the utility company with respect to the terms of such compromise or settlement.
Sec. 13.06.016 Acceptance and acknowledgment of article
In addition to the requirements established by the director, each construction permit application to use the
public rights-of-way shall contain, or have attached, the following:
“By this application for a construction permit to use the public rights-of-way, I, as the lawful

(4) Provide consistent landscaping that reflects the heritage and scenic character of the Texas Hill
Country as stated in the comprehensive plan.
(b) Applicability.
(1) The following standards shall be applied for all properties, platted or unplatted, within the
specific corridors listed below falling within the city limits. These standards shall be in addition to
other regulations set forth in any other ordinance of the City of Bulverde.
(A) U.S. Highway 281.
(B) F.M. 1863.
(C) State Highway 46.
(2) Landscape buffer. A 25-foot landscape buffer, measured from the front property line
immediately adjacent to the right-of-way is required. Where land is reserved for future rights-of-way
per city, county or state thoroughfare plans, the landscape buffer shall be measured from the line of

Drainage facilities include all detention ponds, water-quality ponds, outlet structures, drainage
berms, improved channels, or other improvements associated with the drainage
improvements.
(B) All detention ponds and water-quality ponds within the Scenic Gateway Overlay District
buffer shall be designed to the greatest extent possible to conform to the natural terrain of the
land and if possible as curvilinear, nonrectangular shapes. Detention ponds and water-quality
ponds within the landscape buffer shall be designed so that the facilities do not require chainlink
fences or concrete walls (or similar material). Outlet structures may be concrete with
architectural treatment. Native stone is required for detention ponds and water-quality ponds if
the ponds are located behind or within the landscape buffer. Gabions are expressly prohibited.
(C) Fencing is allowed around detention ponds only if the fencing is constructed of wrought
iron or tubular steel or other similar product. The fence and any detention or water-quality
ponds shall be buffered from the street view by planting native, drought-resistant plants and

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 496/500
caliper size as measured according to section 17.06.008 and the reason for removal. This
alternative for single-family residential lots of 10 acres or less shall be allowed to an individual lot
owner or applicant for no more than one lot in any 12-month period unless a variance in the number
of lots or frequency is reviewed by the planning and zoning commission and approved by the city
council.
(7) If tree relocation is requested, a tree relocation plan that exhibits the current location of
protected, specimen, majestic, and historic trees proposed for replanting and indicate the proposed
replanting location for each.
(8) If tree replacement is requested, a tree replacement plan that exhibits the location of proposed
replacement trees and remaining protected, specimen, majestic, and historic trees. It shall include a
legend indicating the common name, caliper size, and height of proposed replacement trees.
(b) Application review. Upon receipt of proper application, the director shall review the application for
compliance with the provisions of this article. Said review may include a field inspection of the site and the
application may be referred to as such departments as deemed appropriate for review and recommendations.
Following the review and inspection, the director will approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions the
application in accordance with the provisions of this article and issue, refuse to issue, or issue with conditions a
tree removal permit.
(c) Expiration. A tree removal permit expires one (1) year after its effective date, provided that the mitigation
conditions in the permit remain in effect until the conditions are met. If the tree removal permit is issued related
to a master development plan, then the tree removal permit expires when the master development plan expires.
(d) Application for credit. To the extent that section 212.905, Texas Local Government Code applies, an
application for a tree removal permit is an application for credit pursuant to Texas Local Government Code §
212.905(c).
Sec. 17.06.007 Tree pruning restrictions
(a) General. No protected, specimen, majestic, or historic tree shall be pruned in such a manner that would
reasonably lead to the death of the tree.
(b) Allowed pruning. The city may approve pruning of a protected, specimen, majestic, or historic tree in
cases where they must be strategically pruned to allow construction or demolition of a structure. All pruning of
trees by franchise utility companies to ensure the safe operation of utility services shall be allowed. When
allowed, all pruning shall be by approved arboricultural techniques designed to preserve and protect the pruned
trees. This section is not intended to require a permit for reasonable pruning performed or contracted to be
performed by the owner of the tree when unrelated to construction activity.
(c) Required pruning. The city shall have the right to prune trees overhanging public rights of way that
interfere with visibility of any traffic-control device or sign or as necessary to preserve the public safety.
(d) Tree topping. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or city department to severely cut back limbs to
stubs larger than three inches (3") in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the
normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other acts of God, or certain trees
under obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this article at the
determination of the director.
(e) Branch and root pruning of wounded trees. All broken branches and exposed roots two (2) inches in
diameter or greater of protected, specimen, majestic, historic, and replacement trees shall he cut cleanly. In the
case of oak species, in order to prevent infection by oak wilt spores, wounds must be painted with an
acceptable wound dressing within thirty (30) minutes.
Sec. 17.06.008 Tree classifications

(e) Replacement trees not listed above may be considered on a case-by-case basis by the director.
Requests for alternative replacement trees must be submitted in writing with the permit application and such
trees must meet the same dimensional requirements as listed herein.
(f) Existing trees not meeting the dimensional specifications of a protected, specimen, or majestic tree, but
meeting the specifications for a replacement tree, may, and are encouraged to, be used as replacement trees in
lieu of new plantings. Such trees may be left in place or relocated to another portion of the site.
Sec. 17.06.009 Tree removal and mitigation requirements
(a) No historic tree may be removed unless the exceptions apply as described in section 17.06.005 above.
(b) No majestic tree shall be removed unless the exceptions apply as described in section 17.06.005 above.
Additional majestic tree removal may be allowed on a case-by-case basis. A separate permit is required for
each majestic tree removed. The planning and zoning commission shall review each permit application for
majestic tree removal and make a recommendation to city council. City council shall then approve or
disapprove the permit. A 3:1 mitigation amount is required for any majestic tree removed.
(c) The total tree removal from the site cannot exceed 60% of the total caliper width of protected, specimen,
majestic, or historic trees on the site.
(d) Any person removing protected, specimen, or majestic trees shall mitigate such removal by planting,
replanting, relocating or leaving in place replacement tree(s) having a total caliper width equal to the total
caliper width removed, plus any additional mitigation amount as stipulated in subsection (b) above, in
accordance with the following:
(1) Property owner must fulfill 100% of tree removal mitigation requirements.
(2) No more than 35% of the total replacement trees may be of the same species.
(3) At least 50% of the replacement trees shall exceed six inches (6") in caliper width.
(4) Within 60 days of the 1-year anniversary of completion of all work pursuant to a tree removal
permit, the permittee shall provide a report from a certified arborist verifying the viability of all
replacement trees. The permittee shall replace any replacement tree that dies within one (1) year of
being planted. A new one-year warranty period starts for a tree used to replace a dead replacement
tree and the permittee shall provide a report from a certified arborist verifying the viability of such
replacement trees within 60 days of the 1-year anniversary of the planting of such replacement
trees.
(5) Replacement trees shall be dispersed throughout the site, particularly in parking lots, as much
as possible with the exception of any utility easement areas. No replacement trees shall be planted
in utility easement areas.

https://z2.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 499/500
replacement tree caliper may be paid as cash in lieu to the city unless insufficient land area exists as
described in subsection (7), immediately below. Any such payments shall be deposited into a special
account or fund and used by the city to provide or support supplemental landscape plantings in
public areas of the city or acquire wooded property that shall remain in a naturalistic state in
perpetuity. A per-caliper-inch cash value for replacement trees shall be set by the city council after
review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission.
(7) If insufficient land area exists to plant the required total caliper width of replacement trees as
defined in this section, then the cash in lieu amount can be applied to up to 50% of the required
replacement tree caliper. At the sole cost of the permittee, a certified arborist shall make a written
determination of the maximum total caliper width of replacement trees that may be planted on the
site.
(8) Only those trees meeting and replanted in accordance with the applicable Texas Nursery &
Landscape Association Specifications Grades and Standards, or such other set of standards as
designated by the city from time to time, shall satisfy the tree replanting requirements contained
herein.
