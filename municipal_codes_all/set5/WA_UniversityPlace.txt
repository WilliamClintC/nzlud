The City Council finds that the logo of the City adopted in UPMC 1.05.020 is a symbol of the authority of the City and a valuable asset of its population. The City Council desires to ensure that only appropriate uses are made of the City logo.

1.05.020 Adoption.

A. The City adopts the symbol depicted below as its logo.
[IMAGE]


The logo was inspired by University Place’s historic collection of rhododendrons. The rhododendron symbolizes the welcoming, natural ambiance of the City. The simplicity of the form allows the use of a subtle discovery element: The iconic flower forms the letters “U” and “P.” The color palette focuses on the family-friendly and active aspects of the City’s personality.

B. The City adopts as its historic seal the logo which was adopted in 1995 and amended in 2002, depicted below.
[IMAGE]


The historic seal is a stylized portrayal of views from the bluffs of the City of University Place featuring the Narrows Bridge and Olympic Mountains, with a spray of the state flower, the rhododendron, in the foreground. The words “City of University Place” and “Incorporated 1995” are integrated into the design.

(Ord. 542 § 1, 2009; Ord. 344 § 1, 2002; Ord. 69 § 2, 1995).


1.05.030 Purpose.

The City logo shall be used for official purposes only, or as authorized by the City Council. 

(Ord. 69 § 3, 1995).


1.05.040 Unauthorized use.

A. Except as authorized by the City Council, the City logo shall not be used on or in connection with any advertising or promotion for any product, business, organization, service, or article, whether offered for sale, for profit or offered without charge.

B. No person shall use a symbol that imitates the City logo or that is deceptively similar in appearance to the City logo.

C. The City logo may be used for illustrative purposes by the news media if the reproduction is incidental to a publication or broadcast, and may be used in political cartoons. 

(Ord. 69 § 4, 1995).


1.05.050 Penalty for violation.

Any person who willfully violates this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to punishment as set forth in Chapter 1.15 UPMC, General Infraction Provisions.

(Ord. 723 § 2 (Exh. B), 2020; Ord. 481 § 1, 2006; Ord. 100 § 1, 1996).

Any monetary penalty assessed must be paid to the City within 10 calendar days from the date of mailing of the Hearings Examiner’s decision or a notice from the City that penalties are due.

D. Decision of the Hearings Examiner.

1. The Hearings Examiner shall determine whether the City has established by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred and that the required correction will correct the violation and shall affirm, vacate, or modify the City’s decisions regarding the alleged violation and/or the required corrective action, with or without written conditions.

(4) Whether the person showed due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting the violation;

(5) Whether a genuine code interpretation issue exists; and

(6) Any other relevant factors.

c. The Hearings Examiner may double the monetary penalty schedule if the violation was a repeat violation. In determining the amount of the monetary penalty for repeat violations the Hearings Examiner shall consider the factors set forth in subsection (D)(3)(b) of this section.

The City will enforce the Hearings Examiner’s order and recover all related expenses, plus the cost of the hearing and any monetary penalty, from that person.

The decision of all matters decided hereunder shall be final and conclusive unless, within 21 days from the date of the final decision, an applicant or an aggrieved party makes an application to a court of competent jurisdiction or competent administrative agency for review.

D. Recovery of Costs and Expenses. The costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting the violation shall be billed to the person responsible for the violation and/or the owner, lessor, tenant or other person entitled to control, use and/or occupancy of the property and shall become due and payable to the City within 10 calendar days. The term “incidental expenses” includes but is not limited to personal costs, both direct and indirect, including attorneys’ fees; costs incurred in documenting the violation; hauling, storage and disposal expenses; and actual expenses and costs of the City in preparing notices, specifications and contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and inspecting the work; and the costs of any required printing and mailing.

City Council commissions provide a community sounding board and focus group to originate ideas and assist the City Council in fashioning legislative policy. Commissions are exclusively advisory to the City Council. Commissions may not take independent action representing the City with other agencies or bodies, and do not direct or duplicate the work of the City’s administration.

(Ord. 692 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017).


1.35.020 Identification and scope of advisory commissions.

A. Planning Commission. The Planning Commission advises the City Council and conducts public hearings on matters relating to the City’s zoning and land use and development regulations as well as the City’s Comprehensive Plan and other obligations under the State Growth Management Act.

(Ord. 692 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017).


1.35.030 Organization of commissions.

A. Membership. There shall be seven regular voting members of each commission. Except as set forth below, members shall be City residents, and will immediately forfeit their appointment if they move outside the city limits.

1. The Public Safety Advisory Commission shall be comprised of both voting members and nonvoting representatives. The seven at-large members will be voting members. It is recommended to have one representative from each police department, fire district, and school district to act as Commission liaisons who will be active Commission participants but will be nonvoting representatives.

2. The Economic Development Advisory Commission shall be comprised of City residents, business owners, property owners, or business professionals working in the City. One member will be a member of the West Side Branch of the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber of Commerce.

3. The Park Advisory Commission should include one member from the City’s youth population, if feasible.

B. Vacancies and Appointments. Appointments to the commissions, whether due to term expiration or resignation, will follow the commission recruitment and appointment process established by this chapter.

C. Term. Regular voting commission members shall be appointed to four-year terms that shall expire on January 31st. 

D. Removal of Members. Members and liaisons may be removed by City Council motion and affirmative majority vote. Positions shall be deemed vacated after a member is absent for four consecutive unexcused regular meetings.

E. Public Meetings. All commission meetings shall comply with the Open Public Meetings Act and be held in the City. The City Clerk will publish commission meeting notices.

F. Compensation and Staff Support. Members shall serve without compensation. Any expenditure for the commission shall be within the amounts appropriated for the purposes set by the City Council and approved in advance by the City Manager or designee. Staff resource and support shall be as provided by the City Council in the adopted budget under the City Manager’s authority.

H. Conflict of Interest. Each voting member present shall vote on all questions put to the commission unless a conflict of interest as defined in State law precludes it.

(Ord. 692 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017).


1.35.040 Origination of work of advisory commissions.

A. Work Originating from Council. The City Council may direct a commission’s review of legislative policy matters in any of three ways: (1) by reviewing and approving a commission’s proposed annual work plan resolution; (2) by adopting a resolution assigning a legislative policy issue for commission review; or (3) by adopting a resolution approving a commission-recommended legislative policy matter for further commission work.

B. Work or Annual Work Plans Originating from Advisory Commissions. When two or more commissioners desire to propose a legislative policy topic for work by the commission, at least two proponents of the proposed legislative policy topic will describe in writing their proposal, and explain how the proposal is consistent with current adopted City Council goals, and will also set forth the potential budget or staff impact for further development or implementation. The proponents will sign the written proposal and file it with the staff representative assigned to the commission. The written proposal will be distributed to all commission members and calendared for initial review at a commission meeting. At the conclusion of the full commission review, the commission will vote on whether to advance the proposal for a City Council study session. If a majority of commissioners support the proposal, the commission will submit a written request from the commission to the City Clerk to be calendared for a City Council study session through the City Council's established agenda process. For commissions desiring to propose an annual work plan for Council review and consideration, the draft work plan must be submitted through the City’s regular agenda process early enough to be studied by Council and be ready for final consideration not later than the first meeting in December prior to the year it is intended to go into effect.

C. Work Originating through Other City Code Provisions. Where other University Place Municipal Code provisions provide additional means and processes for work to be assigned to advisory commissions, such additional processes remain in effect.

(Ord. 692 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017).


1.35.050 Advisory commission work approval process.

A. All work of legislative policy advisory commissions will be assigned by, or approved by, at least a majority of the City Council by written resolution before City resources (administrative staff work or public funds) are utilized. Council resolutions assigning, or approving, legislative advisory commission work will provide commissions with clear direction, and may establish any appropriate processes and procedures for the work.

B. Unless the resolution or the law provides otherwise, a resolution assigning or approving legislative advisory commission work authorizes the commission to seek public opinion, review, provide recommendations, form ad hoc subcommittees, meet jointly with other City legislative policy advisory commissions and authorizes the commission reasonable means to carry the resolution into the effect which may appear most conformable to the spirit of the resolution.

(Ord. 694 § 1, 2017; Ord. 692 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017).


1.35.060 Advisory commission meetings.

A. Commissions will not have standing monthly meetings, but will meet only when there is work to be done. Commissions should meet only as a majority of the commission deems necessary to work on matters specifically assigned by the City Council, either as part of an annual work plan or by separate resolution, or in the event that two or more commissioners have filed a request to meet to discuss work to be proposed by the commission to the Council for approval.

B. At least annually, the Council will hold a joint meeting with all commissions.

(Ord. 692 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017).


1.35.070 Reporting to Council by advisory commissions.

A. When a commission reports to the City Council on a proposed commission work item, proposed commission annual work plan, or reports back to Council on commission work previously assigned or approved by Council, the report will include attendance by the commission chairperson or vice-chairperson at the Council’s first study of the matter, and may include a minority report.

B. When a commission has met, but has not yet completed any assigned or approved work items, the commission chairperson or vice-chairperson will provide a quarterly update to the Council on the commission’s progress.

(Ord. 692 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017).


1.35.080 Appointment process for advisory commissions.

A. Advertisement for commission vacancies will be posted by the City Clerk’s office. The Human Resources Department will conduct background checks on all applicants.

B. Review of applications and interviews of candidates will be performed by a City Council subcommittee comprised of no more than three Council Members appointed by the City Council each year on a rotating basis to ensure all council members participate. In considering appointments, the subcommittee will confer with the City Attorney and Police Chief regarding any applicant criminal history disclosed by a background check. 

C. The subcommittee’s recommendations will be provided to the full Council and inform the Mayor’s final appointments, but are not binding on the Mayor. The Mayor’s appointments will be reviewed for confirmation by vote of the full City Council. The full Council, by majority vote, may choose to interview all of the Mayor’s appointments to any commission, or all commissions.

D. It is the Council’s intent that in making appointments to any and all advisory bodies, that the Council should seek to afford the greatest number of University Place residents the opportunity to serve for a time on commissions, and should seek to appoint commissioners who are residents and who are representative of the diversity of our community.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.020 Disclosure of public records.

Unless exempt from disclosure under the Act or this chapter, public records shall be available for inspection and copying in accordance with this chapter.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.030 Authority and purpose.

A. The Act requires each City to make available for inspection and copying nonexempt “public records” in accordance with published rules. The Act defines “public records” to include any “writing containing information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned, used, or retained” by the City.

B. The purpose of these rules is to establish the procedures the City shall follow in order to provide full access to public records. These rules provide information to persons wishing to request access to public records of the City and establish processes for both requestors and City staff that are designed to best assist members of the public in obtaining such access.

C. The purpose of the Act is to provide the public full access to information concerning the conduct of government, mindful of individuals’ privacy rights and the desirability of the efficient administration of government. The Act and these rules shall be interpreted in favor of disclosure. In carrying out its responsibilities under the Act, the city shall be guided by the provisions of the Act describing its purposes and interpretation.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.040 Public Records Officer.

A. The City Council for the City of University Place hereby appoints the City Clerk as the official Public Records Officer pursuant to RCW 42.56.580. Any person wishing to request access to public records of the City, or seeking assistance in making such a request, shall contact the Public Records Officer of the City:

University Place, WA 98466

Telephone: 253/566-5656

Fax: 253/566-5658

Information is also available at the City’s website at www.cityofup.com.

B. The Public Records Officer is not required to personally fulfill the requests for public records. A request may be fulfilled by a City employee other than the Public Records Officer. If the request is made to the Public Records Officer but fulfilled by others in the City, the Public Records Officer shall be responsible for directing the request to the appropriate person or persons in the City for processing.

C. The Public Records Officer or designee shall provide the “fullest assistance” to requestors; ensure that public records are protected from damage or disorganization; and prevent fulfilling public records requests from causing excessive interference with essential functions of the City.

(Ord. 717 § 2, 2019; Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.050 Making a request for public records.

A. Any person wishing to inspect or copy public records of the city shall make the request in writing on the city’s request form, or by letter, fax, or e-mail addressed to the public records officer, and include the following information:

1. Name of requestor;

2. Address of requestor;

3. Other contact information, including telephone number and any e-mail address;

4. Identification of the public records adequate for the public records officer or designee to locate the records;

5. The date and time of day of the request; and

6. A statement that the request is not for a commercial purpose.

B. If the requestor wishes to have copies of the records made instead of simply inspecting them, he or she shall so indicate and make arrangements to pay for copies of the records or a deposit.

C. A form is available for use by requestors at the city clerk’s office and on-line at www.cityofup.com.

D. The public records officer or designee may accept requests for public records that contain the above information by telephone or in person. If the public records officer or designee accepts such a request, he or she will confirm receipt of the information and the substance of the request in writing.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.060 Index of public records – Findings.

A. Chapter 42.56 RCW requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of all public records.

B. RCW 42.56.070(4) provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, or would interfere with agency operation, a city need not maintain such an index, but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

C. The city of University Place is comprised of two departments, 14 divisions and subdivisions, which maintain separate databases and/or recordkeeping systems for the indexing of records and information.

D. Because the city has records which are diverse, complex, and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems, formats, and/or databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a central index of records.

E. The city will make available for inspection and/or copying all public records, including any indexes that are maintained by the city pursuant to the Act, Chapter 42.56 RCW, and this chapter.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.070 Order regarding public records index.

Based upon the findings set forth in UPMC 2.30.060, and pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4)(a), the city council orders the following:

A. The city is not required to maintain a current index of public records due to findings of the city council that the requirements are unduly burdensome and such a list is nearly impossible to create and/or maintain; and

B. Pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW and this chapter, the city shall make available for public inspection and/or copying all public records and any indexes of public records maintained by the city to the extent not exempt from inspection and/or copying pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW or other applicable law.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.080 Processing of public records requests.

A. Providing “Fullest Assistance.” The city shall adopt rules to “provide full access to public records,” “protect records from damage or disorganization,” “prevent excessive interference with other essential functions of the agency,” provide “fullest assistance” to requestors, and provide the “most timely possible action” on public records requests. The public records officer or designee shall process requests in the order allowing the most requests to be processed in the most efficient manner.

B. Acknowledging Receipt of Request. Upon receiving a completed written request for public records form, the public records officer shall determine whether the requested record is exempt by law from inspection and copying in whole or in part. The public records officer shall make an initial response to the request for public records within five business days of receipt of the request. In the event a request for public records is received after 5:00 p.m., the request shall be deemed to have been received on the next business day. Depending on the nature of the request, the public records officer shall do one or more of the following:

1. Make the records available for inspection or copying;

2. If copies are requested and payment of a deposit for the copies, if any, is made or terms of payment are agreed upon, send the copies to the requestor;

3. Provide a reasonable estimate of when records will be available;

4. If the request is unclear or does not sufficiently identify the requested records, request clarification from the requestor. Such clarification may be requested and provided by telephone. The public records officer or designee may revise the estimate of when records will be available; or

5. Deny the request.

C. Protecting Rights of Others. In the event that the requested records contain information that may affect rights of others and may be exempt from disclosure, the public records officer may, prior to providing the records, give notice to such others whose rights may be affected by the disclosure. Such notice should be given so as to make it possible for those other persons to contact the requestor and ask him or her to revise the request, or, if necessary, seek an order from a court to prevent or limit the disclosure. The notice to the affected persons shall include a copy of the request.

D. Records Exempt from Disclosure.

1. Some records are exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part, under Chapter 42.56 RCW or other state laws. If the city believes that a record is exempt from disclosure and should be withheld, the public records officer shall state the specific exemption and provide a brief explanation of why the record or a portion of the record is being withheld. If only a portion of a record is exempt from disclosure, but the remainder is not exempt, the public records officer shall redact the exempt portions, provide the nonexempt portions, and indicate to the requestor why portions of the record are being redacted.

2. A decision by the public records officer denying inspection shall be reviewed by the city attorney. Such review shall be deemed complete at the end of the second business day following the denial of inspection and shall constitute final city action for the purposes of judicial review. The requestor shall be notified by mail of the decision to grant or deny the request.

E. No Duty to Create Records. The city is not obligated to create a new record to satisfy a records request.

F. Organization of Records. The city shall maintain its records in a reasonably organized manner. The city shall take reasonable actions to protect records from damage and disorganization. A variety of records are available on the city’s website at www.cityofup.com. Requestors are encouraged to view the documents available on the website prior to submitting a records request.

G. Similar Treatment and Purpose of the Request. The city shall not distinguish among persons requesting records, and such persons shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request, except to determine if the request is for commercial use or would violate another statute prohibiting disclosure.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.090 Inspection of records.

A. Hours for Inspection of Records. Public records are available for inspection and copying during normal business hours of the city, Monday through Friday, by appointment, excluding legal holidays. Records must be inspected at University Place City Hall.

B. Facilities for Inspection of Records. The city shall provide space to inspect public records. No member of the public may remove a document from the viewing area or disassemble or alter any document. The requestor shall indicate which documents he or she wishes the city to copy.

C. Thirty-Day Period for Inspection of Records. The requestor shall claim or review the assembled records within 30 days of the city’s notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. The city shall notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that he or she shall contact the city to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the 30-day period or make other arrangements, the city may close the request and refile the assembled records. Other public records requests can be processed ahead of a subsequent request by the same person for the same or almost identical records, which can be processed as a new request.

D. Providing Copies of Records. After inspection is complete, the public records officer or designee shall make the requested copies or arrange for copying.

E. Providing Records in Installments. When the request is for a broad range of records, the public records officer or designee may provide access for inspection and copying in installments, if he or she reasonably determines that it would be practical to provide the records in that way. If, within 30 days, the requestor fails to inspect the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the public records officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request.

F. Completion of Inspection. When the inspection of the requested records is complete and all requested copies are provided, the public records officer or designee shall indicate that the city has completed a diligent search for the requested records and made any located nonexempt records available for inspection.

G. Closing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request. When the requestor withdraws the request, fails to fulfill his or her obligations to inspect the records, or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for the requested copies, the public records officer shall close the request and indicate to the requestor that the city has closed the request.

H. Later Discovered Documents. If, after the city has informed the requestor that it has provided all available records, the city becomes aware of additional responsive documents existing at the time of the request, the city shall promptly inform the requestor of the additional documents and provide them on an expedited basis.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.100 Exemptions.

A. The Act provides that a number of documents are exempt from public inspection and copying. In addition, documents are exempt from public disclosure if any other statute exempts or prohibits disclosure. Requestors should be aware of exemptions, outside the Act, that restrict the availability of some documents held by the city for inspection and copying.

B. The city clerk’s office shall maintain and make available a list of other statutory exemptions. This list may also be viewed on the city’s website at www.cityofup.com. This list is for informational purposes only and the city’s failure to list an exemption shall not affect the efficacy of any exemption.

C. The city is prohibited by statute from disclosing lists of individuals for commercial purposes.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.110 Reimbursement for copying costs.

A. Copies of written records, maps, photographs including slides, audio tape recordings, video tape recordings and diskettes shall be made and provided by the city upon request and payment of the actual cost of reproducing the same, which cost shall be established by city council resolution.

The costs of reproduction provided for by resolution shall include, but not be limited to, the following records: street maps, zoning maps, zoning codes, ordinances, public meeting minutes, resolutions, verbatim transcripts, deeds, contracts, and other records.

C. Where the request is for a certified copy, there shall be an additional charge in the amount established by city council resolution to cover the additional expense and time required for certification.

D. The public records officer may provide copies of city records at no charge to individuals or government agencies doing business with the city, if the public records officer determines such action is in the best interests of the city.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).


2.30.120 Review of denials of public records.

A. Petition for Internal Administrative Review of Denial of Access. Any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing to the public records officer for a review of that decision. The petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the public records officer or designee denying the request.

B. Consideration of Petition for Review. The public records officer shall promptly provide the petition and any other relevant information to the public records officer’s supervisor or other city official designated by the city to conduct the review. That person will immediately consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the city’s receipt of the petition, or within such other time as the city and the requestor mutually agree to.

C. Judicial Review. Any person may obtain court review of denials of public records request pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 at the conclusion of two business days after the initial denial regardless of any internal administrative appeal.

(Ord. 478 § 2, 2006).

(Ord. 33 § 9, 1995).

If such tax, interest or penalty has not been paid by the taxpayer within 10 days from the date of such sale, exchange, or disposal, the successor shall become liable for the payment of the full amount of tax, interest and penalties. The successor’s liability shall be limited to the purchase price or fair market value of the business purchased if no cash transaction took place. No successor shall be liable for any tax due from the taxpayer from whom the successor has acquired a business or stock of goods if the successor gives written notice to the Finance Director of such acquisition and no assessment is issued by the Finance Director within six months of receipt of such notice against the former operator of the business. Taxpayer’s account will remain on an active status and be subject to all taxes, penalties, and interest until such time as the Finance Director is notified in writing that the taxpayer has discontinued business activity within the City of University Place. Nothing in this chapter is intended nor shall it be construed to prohibit the successor from engaging in business in the City of University Place pending resolution of the successor’s tax liability.

(Ord. 618 § 1, 2013; Ord. 255 § 10, 1999. Formerly 4.60.100).


4.60.130 Tax not exclusive.

The tax levied herein shall be additional to any license fee or tax imposed or levied under any other law or under any other ordinance of the City of University Place.

(Ord. 618 § 1, 2013; Ord. 255 § 11, 1999. Formerly 4.60.110).


4.60.140 Appeal procedure.

Any taxpayer aggrieved by the amount of the fee or tax found by the Finance Director to be required under the provisions of this chapter may, upon full payment of the amount assessed, appeal from such finding by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 14 days from the date such taxpayer was notified in writing of such amount. The Clerk shall, as soon as practicable, fix a time and place for the hearing of such appeal before the Hearings Examiner, which time shall be not more than 60 days after the filing of the notice of appeal, and shall cause a notice of the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the appellant. At such hearing before the Hearings Examiner, the taxpayer shall be entitled to be heard and to introduce evidence in his or her own behalf. The Hearings Examiner shall render a decision, together with findings of fact and conclusions of law, based upon the evidence presented at the time of the hearing and all material on file in the case. The Hearings Examiner’s decision shall indicate the correct amount of the fee or tax owing. The Hearings Examiner’s decision shall be final. The appellant or the City of University Place may appeal the decision of the Hearings Examiner to the Superior Court of Washington in and for Pierce County within 30 days after the date of the Hearings Examiner’s decision. The Hearings Examiner may, by subpoena, require the attendance of any person, and may also require him/her to produce any pertinent books and records. Any person served with such subpoena shall appear at the time and place therein stated and produce the books and records required, if any, and shall testify truthfully under oath administered by the Hearings Examiner as to any matter required of him/her pertinent to the appeal, and it shall be unlawful for him/her to fail or refuse so to do.

(Ord. 618 § 1, 2013; Ord. 255 § 12, 1999. Formerly 4.60.120).


4.60.150 Over or underpayment of tax.

4.65.010 Purpose.

This chapter is intended to:

A. Assist in the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan for the City of University Place.

B. Ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate to serve the development at the time the development is available for occupancy and use, or shortly thereafter, without decreasing current service levels below established minimum standards for the City.

C. Establish standards and procedures so that new development pays a proportionate share of costs for new facilities and services and does not pay arbitrary or duplicative fees for the same impact.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.020 Reserved.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.030 Definitions.

A. “Applicant” means any property owner, developer, or other person who seeks a permit from the City of University Place.

B. “Director” means the City Engineer or his/her authorized designee, or, in the absence thereof, any other person designated by the City Manager.

C. “Dwelling unit” means one or more rooms designed for or occupied by one family for living or sleeping purposes and containing kitchen, sleeping and sanitary facilities for use solely by one family. All rooms comprising a dwelling unit shall have access through an interior door to other parts of the dwelling unit.

D. “Encumber” means to transfer traffic impact fee dollars from the traffic impact fee fund to an account for a particular system improvement that is funded in the City’s capital budget. The account encumbering the traffic impact fee dollars shall bear the name of the system improvement financed with such money.

E. “ITE Trip Generation Manual” means the most current edition of the report entitled “Trip Generation” produced by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

F. “The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)” means the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

G. Permit.

1. For any development occurring within the City of University Place, “permit” shall mean a building permit, unless the development does not require a building permit, in which case, “permit” shall mean a site development permit. Where a building permit is required for the development and the development includes a structure that is built in stages (i.e., completion of the building shell followed by completion of the tenant improvements), then “permit” shall mean the building permit for the tenant improvements, except when applicants seek to prepay their traffic impact fees pursuant to UPMC 4.65.090(D), in which case “permit” may mean the building permit for the building shell.



2. For any development that has obtained or will obtain a building permit from a jurisdiction other than the City of University Place, “permit” shall mean a right-of-way permit.

H. Peak-Hour Trip. For the purposes of the traffic impact fee calculation, the “peak-hour trip” is the number of additional vehicle trips generated by a development during the 60-minute period of highest vehicle traffic volume on the adjacent street network, typically occurring sometime between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Trip generation statistics are provided by the ITE Trip Generation Manual for various land uses and sizes of development. Where the City has previously been provided with trip generation data for development within the City, the Director may utilize such data in calculating the trip generation for impact fee purposes if such data is deemed to be reliable in the sole discretion of the Director. The City has conducted an economic study that demonstrates 65 percent of vehicle trips associated with most retail and restaurant uses have destinations outside of the City. Based on this study, a diverted trip factor of 65 percent shall be applied to the trip generation rate for these uses.  This applies to all retail and restaurant uses with the exception of health and personal care and food and beverage store uses as categorized by the North American Industry Classification System.

I. “Project improvements” means site improvements and facilities that are planned and designed to provide service for, or to mitigate the direct impact from, a particular development project, or that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the project, and are not system improvements.

J. “System improvements” means transportation facilities that are included on the Traffic Impact Fee System Improvements List. A complete list of system improvements is set forth on the Traffic Impact Fee System Improvements List, which is adopted as part of this chapter.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.040 Applicability.

A. All persons receiving a permit from the City of University Place after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be required to pay impact fees in an amount and manner set forth in this chapter. This chapter shall also apply to development located outside of the City limits if the following conditions are met:

1. The development is required to obtain a right-of-way permit from the City of University Place; and

2. The development impacts the City’s street system by adding peak hour trips.

B. Notwithstanding the scope set forth in subsection (A) of this section, the following development activities shall not require payment of traffic impact fees because they do not have a measurable impact on the City’s transportation facilities:

1. Existing Dwelling Unit. Any alteration, expansion, reconstruction, remodeling or replacement of an existing single-family or multifamily dwelling unit that does not result in the creation of additional dwelling units; or

2. Existing Nonresidential Building. Any alteration, reconstruction, remodeling or replacement of an existing nonresidential building, or portion thereof, that does not result in the generation of any new peak hour trips as long as the existing nonresidential building has not been vacant for more than 10 years. If the building has been vacant for 10 years or less, then the number of peak hour trips attributable to that building, or portion thereof, shall be based upon the most intense legally established use that existed within 10 years of permit application. If the building, or portion thereof, has been vacant for more than 10 years, then it shall not be treated as an existing nonresidential building for traffic impact fee purposes.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 588 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 503 § 1, 2007*; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).

*Code reviser’s note: Section 1 of Ordinance 503 states: “Ordinance No. 494 is hereby amended so that it does not apply to any building permit issued where the applicant had submitted a complete application for that building permit prior to April 23, 2007, the effective date of Ordinance No. 494. To the extent that this Ordinance conflicts with UPMC 4.65.040, this Ordinance shall control.”


4.65.050 Reserved.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.060 Service area.

This section establishes one service area whose boundaries shall be consistent with the City limits of the City of University Place.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.070 Traffic impact fee fund established.

A. This section establishes a special purpose traffic impact fee fund to receive traffic impact fees. All traffic impact fees and any investment income generated by such fees shall remain in that fund until spent, encumbered or refunded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

B. Procedures for administration of the fund shall be established by the Finance Director. These accounts shall be expended in accordance with the City’s normal budget procedures subject to the limitations set forth in UPMC 4.65.080 and RCW 82.02.070. Annually, the City shall prepare a report on the impact fee fund showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, interest earned, and system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by these impact fees.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.080 Use of funds.

A. Traffic impact fees shall be used for development of transportation facilities that constitute system improvements.

B. Impact fees may be spent on the following items to the extent that they relate to a particular system improvement: facility planning, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, facility construction, facility engineering and design work, facility permit fees, facility financing, grant matching funds, applicable mitigation costs, capital equipment pertaining to a particular system improvement, and any other capital costs related to a particular system improvement.

C. Impact fees may also be used to recoup transportation facility improvement costs previously incurred by the City to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously acquired or constructed improvements resulting in such costs.

D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the construction of system improvements, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.090 Impact fee determination and collection.

A. At the time of permit issuance, unless otherwise expressly provided in subsection (D) of this section, City staff shall determine the total impact fee owed by multiplying the development’s peak-hour trip generation by the impact fee per peak-hour trip in effect at the time of permit issuance.

B. Impact fee collection shall also occur at the time of permit issuance, unless otherwise expressly provided in subsection (D) or (E) of this section.

C. An applicant may request that the impact fee be calculated in advance of permit issuance, but any such advance calculation shall not be binding upon the City and should only be used as guidance by the applicant. Applicants should note that, except as expressly provided in subsection (D) of this section, it is not possible to have a vested right to pay a particular impact fee in advance of permit issuance. If the City Council revises the impact fee formula or the impact fees themselves prior to the time that a permit is issued for a particular development, the formula or fee amount in effect at the time of permit issuance shall apply to the development, unless the impact fees were prepaid pursuant to subsection (D) of this section.

D. Applicants may opt to prepay their impact fees in conjunction with the submittal of a complete application for a permit.

1. If an applicant opts to prepay in conjunction with an application for a shell permit (as opposed to a tenant improvement permit) then the prepayment will be made based upon the most likely ultimate uses of the project and the trip generation associated with those uses. Upon such prepayment, the applicant is vested to the impact fee in effect at the time of prepayment, but only for the number of trips estimated and actually prepaid. For example, if the estimated peak-hour trip generation at the time of application is 100 trips, and the applicant prepays the traffic impact fees for those 100 trips, the applicant will still need to obtain an impact fee determination under subsection (A) of this section upon issuance of permits for the tenant improvements. If, at that time, the determination reveals that the project will generate 120 peak-hour trips, the applicant will need to pay the impact fees for the 20 trips that were not prepaid and will need to pay the fees according to the fee schedule then in effect.

2. If an applicant opts to prepay in conjunction with an application for a tenant improvement permit, and, subsequent to the prepayment, the applicant’s proposed use changes, the applicant will need to obtain another impact fee determination pursuant to subsection (A) of this section. If the subsequent determination reveals an increased trip count over the trip count at the time of prepayment, then the applicant shall pay the impact fee for the additional trips based upon the fee schedule in effect at that time. The applicant is not vested to the earlier impact fee amount with respect to the additional trips.

3. If an applicant prepays impact fees for a development that will have more than one end user, the prepaid impact fees and trip generation basis for those impact fees shall be applied evenly over the entire development on a per square foot basis. For example, if an applicant prepays impact fees based upon 100 peak-hour trips for a 5,000-square-foot shopping mall at the shell stage and the mall is later divided into four spaces of 2,000, 1,500, 1,000, and 500 square feet, when the impact fee determination is done at the tenant improvement stage, each 50 square feet of space shall be deemed to have paid for one peak-hour trip. So, if the 500-square-foot space is determined to generate 20 peak-hour trips, the applicant for that space will still need to pay for the additional 10 peak-hour trips according to the impact fee schedule then in effect.

E. Applicants may opt to defer the payment of their impact fees as described below:

1.  An applicant may elect to defer impact fee payment until occupancy of the permitted facility.  Under this deferral, impact fee payment for residential projects must be made prior to final building inspection and approval; impact fee payment for commercial projects shall be made prior to the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.

2.  An applicant may elect to defer impact fee payment out to five years with equal annual payments (one-fifth due each year).

a. Under this deferral, the applicant shall pay, to the City, one-fifth of the total impact fee amount each year for five years. This amount may be reduced by the amount of any sales tax credits given under UPMC 4.65.110. The first payment shall be due one year from permit issuance unless other payment terms have been agreed to in advance between the City and the applicant. As consideration to the City for allowing the deferral, the applicant will voluntarily waive any right to reimbursement of the traffic impact fees.

b. In the event the associated use or business ceases operation prior to end of the deferral period, the property owner may request to the City, in writing, a suspension of impact fee assessments for that use. Upon receipt of this notice, any outstanding impact fee amounts will be suspended until a new use occupies the space.  Any amounts paid to the impact fee prior to this suspension will apply as a credit toward future uses. 

3.  If an applicant elects to defer payment by either subsection (E)(1) or (E)(2) of this section, the applicant will voluntarily allow a lien to be filed against the property prior to permit issuance. The amount of the lien shall be equal to the deferred amount of the impact fee. All costs associated with filing the lien shall be included in the applicant’s permit fee.

4.  If an applicant elects to defer payment by either subsection (E)(1) or (E)(2) of this section, a written recordable agreement must be executed between the property owner and the City prior to permit issuance. This agreement shall be in a form prescribed by the Director and shall set forth the terms of the deferral including provisions for payment, lien release, change of use, expiration, and penalties for noncompliance. The agreement shall be recorded against the property and the applicant shall be responsible for the payment of any associated recording fees.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.100 Impact fee adjustments – Independent calculations.

An applicant may request an adjustment to the impact fees determined according to this chapter by preparing and submitting to the Director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a permit is sought. Any independent fee calculation must be accompanied by a traffic impact analysis performed by a qualified professional engineer. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.

A. If the Director agrees with the independent fee calculation, a written agreement to accept such amount shall be transmitted to the applicant who shall, in turn, present it to the Development Services Department upon impact fee collection.

B. If the Director does not agree with the independent fee calculation, the applicant may appeal this decision to the Hearings Examiner through procedures outlined in UPMC Title 22.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.110 Impact fee credits.

An applicant shall be entitled to a credit against the traffic impact fee assessed and collected under this chapter in accordance with this section.

A. Sales Tax Generation Credit.

1. If an applicant elects to defer the impact fee payment for five years in accordance with UPMC 4.65.090, then the applicant shall also be eligible to receive a sales tax generation credit against the annual impact fee payment.

2. The annual amount of the sales tax generation credit shall be one-half of the City’s portion of the actual sales tax revenue generated by the use associated with the permit, which is reported and remitted to the City by the Washington State Department of Revenue, or the full amount of the yearly impact fee payment, whichever is less.

3. The amount of sales tax revenue received by the City which is credited to an applicant under this chapter will be deposited by the City in the traffic impact fee fund.

B. System Improvement Credit.

1. An applicant shall be entitled to a credit against the traffic impact fee assessed and collected under this chapter in any of the following situations; provided, that to qualify for a credit, the system improvement that is provided or funded as described below must be listed on the Traffic Impact Fee System Improvements List:

a. Whenever a project is approved subject to a condition that the applicant actually provide a particular system improvement; or

b. Whenever an applicant has agreed, pursuant to the terms of a voluntary agreement with the City, to provide a particular system improvement; or

c. Whenever an applicant has paid a traffic mitigation fee which is allocated toward providing system improvements; or

d. Whenever an applicant’s predecessor-in-interest has actually provided and/or funded a system improvement in contemplation of future development.

2. If the land dedicated, facility constructed, or fee paid is allocated partly toward system improvements and partly toward project improvements, the credit shall be limited to that portion allocated to system improvements.

3. For the purposes of calculating the credit, the land value or costs of construction shall be determined as follows:

a. The amount of credit for land dedicated shall be the higher of either the assessed value of the land established by the Pierce County Assessor or by an appraisal conducted by an independent professional appraiser chosen by the applicant from a list of at least three such appraisers provided by the City. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the applicant. For the purposes of this section, the date of value shall be the date the land was dedicated to the City. The appraisal shall only value the land dedicated and not any alleged damages to any abutting property.

b. The amount of credit for facilities constructed shall be based upon the actual cost of construction at the time of construction.

4. The applicant shall be entitled to such credit against the impact fee regardless of whether the system improvement was provided before or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

5. A system improvement credit must be requested within 30 days after permit issuance or it is deemed waived.

C. Determinations made pursuant to this section may be appealed to the Examiner under UPMC Title 22.

D. No refund will be allowed in the event that the impact fee credit calculation exceeds the amount of the impact fee itself.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.120 Impact fee refunds.

A. The current owner of property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within 10 years of their receipt by the City. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis from the date of receipt.

B. The City shall provide for the refund of fees according to the requirements of this section and RCW 82.02.080.

1. The City shall notify potential claimants of the refund availability by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the Pierce County tax records.

2. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the City Finance Director in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later.

C. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered within 10 years of their receipt by the City, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained by the City and expended consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

D. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.

E. Should the City seek to terminate all impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which an impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that all fee requirements are to be terminated, the City shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the Pierce County tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the City, but must be expended for the original purposes, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

F. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:

1. The developer does not proceed to finalize the development activity as required by statute or City Code or the International Building Code; and

2. The City has not expended or encumbered the impact fees prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the City has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit against any then-existing traffic impact fee requirement. The owner must petition the City in writing and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The City shall determine whether to grant a credit and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in this chapter.

G. The amount to be refunded shall include the interest earned by this portion of the account from the date that it was deposited into the impact fee fund.

(Ord. 662 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 659 § 1, 2015; Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.130 Appeals and payments under protest.

A. This subsection (A) applies when an applicant seeks a permit to construct a portion of a development that has already been reviewed and approved, in other respects, pursuant to procedures that comply with Chapter 36.70B RCW. An example of this circumstance would be an application for a permit to build one house in a large subdivision that was previously approved. In this case, any appeal of the decision of the City with regard to the imposition of an impact fee or the amount of any impact fees, impact fee credit, or impact fee refund must be taken before the Hearings Examiner pursuant to UPMC Title 22 in conjunction with an appeal of the underlying building permit.

B. This subsection (B) applies when an applicant seeks a permit in conjunction with other development approvals that may be subject to an open record hearing and closed record appeal pursuant to procedures that comply with Chapter 36.70B RCW. An example of this circumstance would be an application for a short plat and permit to build a new office park. In this case, any appeal of the decision of the City with regard to the imposition of an impact fee or the amount of any impact fees, impact fee credit, or impact fee refund must be made according to the process outlines for and in conjunction with the underlying development approval.

C. Any applicant may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest in order to obtain a permit.

D. Only the applicant has standing to appeal impact fee matters.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.140 Council review of impact fees.

The traffic impact fee schedule adopted by the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be reviewed by the City Council annually in conjunction with the update of the Traffic Impact Fee System Improvements List.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.150 Reserved.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).


4.65.160 Impact fee calculations and schedule of traffic impact fees.

A. The traffic impact fee shall be assessed against all new development requiring a permit on a per peak-hour trip basis and calculated using the traffic impact fee schedule, which identifies the adopted fee amount per peak-hour trip generated. The traffic impact fee schedule represents the City’s determination of the appropriate share of system improvement costs to be paid by new growth and development.

B. The traffic impact fee schedule and service area boundaries adopted in this chapter have been calculated and determined using the data shown in the traffic impact fee supporting documents.

(Ord. 602 § 1, 2011; Ord. 520 § 1, 2008; Ord. 494 § 3, 2007).

The Director may certify as eligible an application which is determined to comply with the requirements of this chapter. A decision to approve or deny an application shall be made within 90 calendar days of receipt of a complete application.

A. Approval. The Director may approve the application if he/she finds that:

A. Extension. The conditional certificate and time for completion of the project may be extended by the Director for a period not to exceed a total of 24 consecutive months. To obtain an extension, the applicant must submit a written request with a fee stating the grounds for the extension. An extension may be granted if the Director determines that:

1. The anticipated failure to complete construction or rehabilitation within the required time period is due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner; and

2. The owner has been acting and could reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and

3. All the conditions of the original contract between the applicant and the City will be satisfied upon completion of the project.

If an extension is denied, the Director shall state in writing the reason for denial and shall send notice to the applicant’s last known address within 10 calendar days of the denial. Pursuant to State law, an applicant may appeal the denial of an extension to the Hearings Examiner, pursuant to the UPMC, within 14 calendar days of receipt of the denial by filing a complete appeal application and fee with the Director. No appeal to the City Council is provided from the Hearings Examiner’s decision.

(Ord. 619 § 1, 2013).

B. A description of the completed work and a statement of qualification for the exemption; and

C. A statement that the work was completed within the required three-year period or any authorized extension.

Within 30 calendar days of receipt of all materials required for a final certificate, the Director shall determine whether the specific improvements satisfy the requirements of the contract, application, and this chapter.

A. Granting of Final Certificate. If the Director determines that the project has been completed in accordance with this chapter and the contract between the applicant and the City, and has been completed within the authorized time period, the City shall, within 10 calendar days of the expiration of the 30-day review period above, file a final certificate of tax exemption with the Pierce County Assessor.

B. Denial and Appeal. The Director shall notify the applicant in writing that a final certificate will not be filed if the Director determines that:

1. The improvements were not completed within the authorized time period; or

2. The improvements were not completed in accordance with the agreement between the applicant and the City; or

3. The owner’s property is otherwise not qualified under this chapter.

Pursuant to State law an applicant may appeal a denial to the Hearings Examiner pursuant to the UPMC within 14 calendar days of issuance of the denial of a final certificate by filing a complete appeal application and fee with the Director. No appeal to the City Council is provided from the Hearings Examiner’s decision. Under State law, the applicant may appeal the Hearings Examiner’s decision to the Pierce County Superior Court, if the appeal is filed within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of that decision.

(Ord. 619 § 1, 2013).


4.80.110 Annual compliance review.

A. Within 30 calendar days after the first anniversary of the date of filing the final certificate of tax exemption and each year thereafter for a period of eight years, the property owner shall be required to file a notarized declaration with the Director indicating the following:

1. A statement of occupancy and vacancy of the multifamily units during the previous 12 months; and

2. A certification that the property continues to be in compliance with the contract with the City and this chapter; and

3. A description of any subsequent improvements or changes to the property.

B. City staff shall also conduct on-site verification of the declaration. Failure to submit the annual declaration shall result in a review of the exemption as provided in State law.

(Ord. 619 § 1, 2013).


4.80.120 Cancellation of tax exemption.

If the Director determines that the owner is not complying with the terms of the contract or this chapter, the tax exemption shall be canceled. This cancellation may occur in conjunction with the annual review or at any other time when noncompliance has been determined. If the owner intends to convert the multifamily housing to another use, the owner shall notify the Director and the Pierce County Assessor in writing within 60 calendar days of the change in use.

A. Effect of Cancellation. If a tax exemption is canceled due to a change in use or other noncompliance, the following taxes and penalties will apply:

1. Additional real property tax, plus interest, shall be imposed based upon the value of the nonqualifying improvements. This additional tax is calculated based upon the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if it had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements dated back to the date that the improvements were converted to a nonqualifying use.

2. A penalty shall be imposed amounting to 20 percent of the value of the additional property tax plus interest.

3. The interest is calculated at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes from the dates on which the additional property tax could have been paid without penalty if the improvements had been assessed at full value without regard to this tax exemption program.

4. The additional taxes, interest and penalties will become a lien on the land and attach at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from multifamily use or the amenities no longer meet applicable requirements. The lien has priority over and must be fully paid and satisfied before a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the land may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent ad valorem property taxes.

B. Notice and Appeal. Pursuant to State law, upon determining that a tax exemption is to be canceled, the Director shall notify the owner by mail, return receipt requested.

The property owner may appeal the determination to the Hearings Examiner pursuant to the UPMC by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 30 calendar days, specifying the factual and legal basis for the appeal. The Hearings Examiner will conduct a hearing under the UPMC. Under State law, an aggrieved party may appeal the Hearings Examiner’s decision to the Pierce County Superior Court.

(Ord. 619 § 1, 2013).


4.80.130 Annual report by City.

The City shall report annually by December 31st of each year to the Washington State Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development. The report must include the following information:

5.10.130 Alternative permit processing.

A. Scope. For certain major special events where the estimated size, scope or nature of the proposed event will likely have significant impacts on public services or where the event will require multiple permits and approvals from the City, the Director may determine to modify the requirements set forth elsewhere in the City’s municipal codes in accordance with this section in order to avoid duplication and promote efficient processing and enforcement of special event permits. No special event permit shall be required if the event sponsor, organizer or other party and the City have entered into a written agreement covering the same matters as would otherwise be included in a special event permit for such event.

B. Permit Consolidation. To avoid duplication, when a special event permit covers the subject matter and submittal materials of a separate permit to his/her satisfaction, the Director may consolidate and waive the separate application for and issuance of multiple administrative permits and approvals, including but not limited to right-of-way use permits, street closures, temporary sign permits, building permits for temporary structures, and sales permits. The Director may request additional information under this consolidated permit review process to ensure permit conditions are in place to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

C. Additional Requirements. In order to efficiently process consolidated approvals under a special event permit and to address the significant impacts to City services from very large events, the Director may require additional submittals, amend permit requirements set forth in the City’s municipal code, and impose additional permit conditions. The Director may include in a permit, among other provisions, reasonable terms or conditions as to the time, place and manner of the event; the implementation of a plan presented by the applicant and approved by the Director for crowd control, traffic control and security; compliance with applicable health and sanitary regulations; coordination with the Fire Department for emergency treatment; emergency communication; fire suppression equipment with structures; and maintenance of unobstructed emergency passageways. In determining conditions, the Director shall consider the anticipated impacts of the event based on an assessment of the event, including size, scope, complexity and history. Conditions shall be based upon projected impacts on public safety, public places and public services.

The Director may take the following actions, if reasonably related to the potential or likely impacts to the public due to the estimated size, scope, or nature of the proposed event:

1. Require pre-application meetings to assure adequate planning;

2. Establish a reasonable schedule of timelines and deadlines for applicant submittals and City review;

3. Allow exceptions to time limits for events and set reasonable times for pre-event preparation and post-event cleanup activities;

4. Allow exceptions to the size, number, time, and removal requirements for temporary signs based upon the size and scope of the event;

5. Require the applicant provide additional information if necessary based on the size and nature, including but not limited to site and staging plans, parking and shuttle plans, traffic and road closure plans, security plans, emergency medical services plans, fire suppression plans, sanitation plans, and cleanup plans;

6. Place such reasonable conditions on any permit approval as may be necessary to regulate the time, place and manner of the event and implement any associated approved mitigation plans; the Director shall consider the anticipated impacts of the event based on an assessment of the size, scope, complexity, and history of the event as well as the event organizer’s successful implementation of conditions in previous permits;

7. Require the applicant provide indemnification and increased insurance coverage commensurate with the potential risk related to the event and the naming of the City as an additional insured;

8. Require the applicant provide a bond, deposit, or other financial guarantee to the City, in a form approved by the City Attorney, sufficient to cover the estimated cost of cleaning, repair or restoration of public property.

D. Consolidated Permit Issuance. The City will review the application materials, plans and other submittals and the Director may approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application. The Director may deny the application if it reasonably appears that the applicant has not provided sufficient services for traffic, parking, crowd control, safety, sanitation, medical assistance or other impacts affecting public health, safety and welfare. The Director may deny the permit if there is imminent possibility of violent disorderly conduct likely to endanger public safety or result in significant property damage.

E. Fees. Unless otherwise waived by the City Council by separate resolution or set forth in a separate cost recovery or revenue-sharing agreement approved by the City Council, all City costs shall be paid for by the applicant as follows. For those permits processed under this section, the Director shall charge the actual cost of the City personnel and equipment involved in providing services for the major special event, including but not limited to adjusted permit fees for permit processing and site inspections, fire response, police or staff support during the event, equipment use, and the cost of any cleanup or repair. Prior to permit issuance, the applicant shall provide a bond, deposit, or other financial guarantee to the City, in a form approved by the City Attorney, sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the City services, equipment or personnel used for the event.

(Ord. 526 § 1, 2008).

5.15.010 Findings of fact.

Based on public testimony, other evidence presented to it, and on the evidence considered by other cities which have investigated the impacts of live adult entertainment business establishments, the City Council makes the following findings of fact:

A. The secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this chapter are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of University Place and, therefore, such activities must be regulated.

B. Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred. This history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution, illegal employment of minors, narcotics and alcoholic beverage law violation, breaches of the peace, tax evasion, and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants.

C. Proximity between entertainers and patrons during live adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact, the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, prostitution, and other crimes. Concerns about crime, the transmission of diseases and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the City which demand reasonable regulation of live adult entertainment establishments to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.

D. The activities described in subsections (B) and (C) of this section occur, in the absence of regulation, regardless of whether the live adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages and liquor.

E. It is necessary to license entertainers in the live adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors, to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult, and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible.

F. It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of live adult entertainment establishments at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the adult entertainment establishment, including the actions of members of the public, entertainers and other employees.

G. The license fees required in this chapter are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the City in regulating the adult entertainment industry.

H. Hidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment industry in the absence of regulation. These hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and white collar crime elements. For the City to effectively protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of its citizens and effectively allocate its law enforcement resources it is important that the City be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments, and identities and backgrounds of persons responsible for management and control of the live adult entertainment performed in those establishments.

I. It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress or censor any expressive activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution, but rather to enact time, place and manner regulations which address the compelling interests of the City to mitigate the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments while conforming with the standards described by the Washington Supreme Court in the case of Ino Ino, Inc. v. Bellevue.

9.10.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, not to protect individuals or create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially benefited by the terms of this chapter. This chapter does not impose or create duties on the part of the city or any of its departments, and the obligation of complying with the requirements of this chapter, and any liability for failing to do so, is placed solely upon the parties responsible for owning, operating, monitoring, installing or maintaining security alarm systems.

The intent of this chapter is to encourage alarm businesses and alarm users to maintain the operational viability of security alarm systems and to significantly reduce or eliminate false alarm dispatch requests made to the police department.

The city regulates security alarm businesses to assure that responses to false alarms do not diminish the availability of police services to the general public and to assure that citizens who cannot afford or do not choose to operate security alarm systems are not penalized for their condition or choice.

(Ord. 473 § 1, 2006).

“Alarm user” means any person or entity who has contracted for monitoring, repair, installation or maintenance service from an alarm business for an alarm system, or who owns or operates an alarm system which is not monitored, maintained or repaired under contract.

“Department” means the city of University Place community services department, its agent, the University Place police department, or other agent authorized by the city manager.

An alarm shall be presumed to be false if the police officers responding do not locate any evidence of an intrusion or commission of an unlawful act or emergency on the premises which might have caused the alarm to sound. Alarms caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, or other violent acts of nature shall not be deemed to be false alarms.

“False alarm service charge” means a charge for the second and each subsequent false alarm response. False alarm service charges shall be set by the city council by separate resolution.

It is the responsibility of the alarm business to submit an application prior to the registration expiration date. Failure to renew will result in alarm dispatch requests from the alarm business not being accepted for dispatch.

(Ord. 473 § 1, 2006).


9.10.100 Duties of the alarm businesses.

Alarm businesses shall:

A. Work cooperatively with the department to reduce false dispatches to false alarms.

B. Provide the department with information regarding alarm systems installed, operated, monitored and cancelled within the city of University Place in the format (paper or electronic) requested by the department at least quarterly or as otherwise requested by the department;

C. Inform the department of any alarm site that is ineligible for an alarm dispatch request by law enforcement;

D. Inform the department of alarm sites that protect weapons, ammunition, explosives, or certain types of hazardous materials which require a third party capable of responding to secure the alarm site;

E. Make all requests for alarm dispatches to a telephone number and in the form designated by the department;

F. Not make requests for alarm dispatches for alarm systems that are on the department’s nonresponse list for a revoked permit;

G. Program arming station control panels to send cancel codes to abort dispatches;

H. Upon takeover of any alarm system, the alarm business shall upgrade or modify the alarm system to bring the system into compliance with this chapter;

I. Alarm businesses must maintain for a period of at least one year records relating to alarm dispatch requests. Records must include the name, address, and phone number of the alarm user, the alarm system zone(s) and sensors activated, use of third-party responders, the time of alarm dispatch request and, if applicable, reasons which led to alarm cancellations. The department may request copies of such records for individually named alarm users; and

J. Alarm businesses that perform monitoring services for a fee whose registration is suspended or revoked are required to notify all alarm user customers within five days of the suspension of such suspension or revocation. The alarm user shall be notified that the department shall not accept alarm dispatch requests from the suspended or revoked business, and will not respond to their alarm during the alarm business’s suspension or revocation.

(Ord. 473 § 1, 2006).


9.10.110 Alarm business registration revocation.

A. Grounds for Revocation. The department may revoke an alarm business registration for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or the failure to comply with requests for information from the department as provided for in this chapter.

B. Notice of Revocation. The department shall notify such registrant in writing by first class mail or personal service of the revocation of the alarm business registration and the grounds thereof. The notice shall specify the specific date of revocation, which shall be no sooner than 21 days after the notice is deposited in the mail or personally served, and that the department shall discontinue responding to alarm dispatch requests from the alarm business for their customers. The alarm business will be required to notify their alarm system monitoring customers that the department will not respond to alarms at their alarm site beginning 21 days after the department mails notice to the alarm business.

C. Appeal. The alarm business may appeal the notice of revocation to the hearings examiner in accordance with Chapter 2.20 UPMC. A notice of appeal, together with the applicable fee, must be filed with the city clerk no later than 14 days after the date the notice of revocation is either mailed to or personally served on the alarm business.

D. Reinstatement. Alarm business registration may be reinstated upon receipt and approval by the Department of a plan to correct the conditions that led to the revocation and payment of all fees and penalties due from the alarm business. The City shall not be responsible for any costs incurred by the alarm business to qualify for reinstatement.

(Ord. 473 § 1, 2006).


9.10.120 Government immunity.

A. Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm permit, the alarm user or permittee acknowledges that law enforcement response may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels, and prior response history.

B. The Department recognizes that some alarm sites may pose a greater public safety risk due to their business and/or contents of the alarmed site. In the event that a potential risk to the public is perceived due to an unsecured alarm site, the Department may elect to provide security measures to secure the site until the responsible parties can arrive. However, the Department shall not be responsible for securing any alarm site or for the loss or damage to any property.

C. The Department shall not be responsible for any acts or failure to act by the alarm user or permittee. In certain situations, the Department may not respond to requests for alarm responses due to permit revocation, or the failure to obtain a permit.

D. The Department shall not be responsible for investigating alarm sites that are inaccessible due to fences, terrain obstructions, other physical obstructions, or potentially dangerous animals.

(Ord. 473 § 1, 2006).


9.10.130 Penalties and enforcement.

A. Criminal Penalties. Any person violating any of the terms of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof be penalized as provided in Chapter 1.15 UPMC.

B. Civil Penalties. In addition to any criminal penalties, any person who fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty in accordance with Chapter 1.15 UPMC.

C. Other Legal Remedies. Nothing in this chapter limits the right of the City to pursue other lawful, criminal, civil or equitable remedies to abate, discontinue, correct or discourage unlawful acts under or in violation of this chapter.

D. Enforcement action by the City shall be in accordance with Chapter 1.20 and/or 1.30 UPMC at the City’s discretion.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. E), 2017; Ord. 473 § 1, 2006; Ord. 218 § 8, 1999).

After consideration, the Council may, by resolution, either accept, reject or modify the recommendation and require the property owner to abate the violation by removal or destruction, at his or her cost and expense, within a time specified in the resolution.

B. The resolution shall not be passed until the property owner is given at least five days’ notice of the pendency of the proposed resolution. The notice shall describe the property involved, the nature of the hazardous condition, the corrective action required, and the date of the Council meeting during which the matter will be considered.

Chapter 9.36 GRAFFITI

Sections:

9.36.010    Declaration of policy – Findings.

9.36.060    Use of public funds for graffiti removal.

9.36.070    City costs enforceable – Debt – Lien.


9.36.010 Declaration of policy – Findings.

City Council finds that graffiti on public and private buildings, structures and personal property creates a condition of blight within the City that can result in the deterioration of property values, business opportunities and enjoyment of life for persons using that property, surrounding property and the community. The presence of graffiti is inconsistent with the City’s goals of maintaining property, preventing crime and preserving aesthetic standards. The continued presence of graffiti is a visual symbol of disorder that demoralizes and erodes feelings of safety in our neighborhoods. It contributes to neighborhood decline by inviting crime and leading to a climate of intimidation; and reduces commerce, tax revenues and community pride. While it is appropriate to request that courts require offenders convicted of graffiti crimes to restore the property they defaced, obtaining convictions is difficult because graffiti offenses can be committed quickly and secretively without any witnesses. Therefore, prompt removal of graffiti from public and private property is in the public interest. The purpose of graffiti enforcement under this chapter is to promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public.

(Ord. 686 § 1, 2017).


9.36.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following words shall have the following meanings:

B. “Graffiti nuisance property” means private property upon which graffiti exists and where, after the City issues a notice of violation pursuant to the procedures in the City’s public nuisance and enforcement codes, the graffiti has not been abated by the deadline set by the City.

C. “Private contractor” means any person or entity with whom the City contracts to remove graffiti.

D. “City authorized volunteer” means any person who has complied with requirements established by the City’s administration to be authorized to remove graffiti.

E. “Property” means real or personal property, including but not limited to buildings, structures, walls, signs, poles, bridges, roads, sidewalks, fences, gates, motor vehicles, rocks, trees and other natural features.

(Ord. 686 § 1, 2017).


9.36.030 Graffiti deemed nuisance.

Graffiti is determined to adversely impact public health, safety and welfare and is deemed a public nuisance. Graffiti nuisance properties may be abated by the City through the processes described in the City’s nuisance code, enforcement code and this chapter.

(Ord. 686 § 1, 2017).


9.36.040 Allowing graffiti to remain prohibited – Penalties.

9.36.050 Extraordinary circumstances – Abatement by City.

In circumstances where in the judgment of the City Manager or designee, in his or her sole discretion, graffiti on private property represents an imminent threat to public health, safety and welfare, such graffiti may be abated by City forces, by private contractor, or by City authorized volunteer, and the City and its contractors and volunteers are authorized to enter upon the premises with prior written consent of the owner, or under the terms of a valid court order, for such purposes. If the City provides for the removal of the graffiti, the City shall neither authorize nor undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located, unless the City determines that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community. All aspects of graffiti removal are at the discretion of the City Manager or designee including, but not limited to, the method of and material used for repair. Property owners will be asked for their written consent in advance of City’s entry onto non-City property for graffiti removal purposes. If such consent is refused, the City’s administration, in its sole discretion, may elect to seek issuance of a court order allowing entry on any non-City property for purposes of graffiti abatement under this chapter.

(Ord. 686 § 1, 2017).


9.36.060 Use of public funds for graffiti removal.

Whenever the City becomes aware of or is notified of and determines that graffiti is located on publicly or privately owned property visible from premises open to the public, the City Manager is authorized, in his or her discretion, to use public funds available within the City budget and within his or her expenditure authority for the removal of graffiti.

(Ord. 686 § 1, 2017).


9.36.070 City costs enforceable – Debt – Lien.

Any and all costs incurred by the City in the abatement of a graffiti nuisance, including any costs of securing court orders to enter non-City property, shall constitute a debt owed to the City by the property’s owner of record, and shall be enforceable by a lien against the property upon which such nuisance existed.

9.60.010 Purpose – Findings.

Pursuant to Chapter 35.80 RCW, the City Council finds that there are within the City of University Place dwellings which are unfit for human habitation and buildings, structures, and premises or portions thereof which are unfit for other uses due to dilapidation, disrepair, structural defects, unpermitted and substandard construction or modification, filth and other conditions attracting insects or vermin or likely to spread disease, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities, or other similar conditions and violations of various building, health, and safety regulations, and/or which are vacant, unsecured, and abandoned or apparently abandoned. Such dwellings, buildings, structures, and premises are dangerous to occupants, threaten the public health, safety, and welfare, attract and harbor vagrants and criminals, offend public values, lower the value of neighboring properties, contribute to neighborhood or community deterioration, and hamper community and economic development. When the owners or other persons in possession or control of such properties are unwilling or unable to correct such conditions in a proper and timely manner, it is in the interest of the community for the City to intervene and correct, repair, or remove such buildings, structures, and conditions and to pursue all legal means to recover from such persons and/or properties the costs of doing so, including the costs of staff salaries and benefits, materials, contractors, and all other legally recoverable costs and expenses.

(Ord. 723 § 4 (Exh. D), 2020).

Unless the context provides otherwise, the following words and phrases where used in this chapter shall have the meaning and construction given in this section:

A. “Abate” shall mean to put an end to, or otherwise diminish the intensity of, any condition causing a structure to be dangerous or unfit.

B. “Abandoned” or “apparently abandoned” shall mean any structure or premises that is so neglected, or other characteristics exist, such that it appears to be vacant and not cared for by any owner, occupant, or other party.

C. “Public Officer” shall mean and include the Building Official or designees.

D. “Person” shall mean and include any individual, business, corporation, organization, or entity.

E. “Owner” shall mean the owner or taxpayer shown in the records of the Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer, recorded with the Pierce County Auditor, or as otherwise known to the City of University Place, and shall include any manager or other representative of the owner, or other person with responsibility for or control over the structure or premises.

F. “Structure” shall mean or include that which is built or constructed or a portion thereof.

(Ord. 723 § 4 (Exh. D), 2020).


9.60.030 Authority of Public Officer.

The Public Officer is hereby authorized to exercise such powers as may be necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter. These powers shall include the following in addition to others granted in this chapter: (A)(1) to determine which dwellings are unfit for human habitation; (2) to determine which buildings, structures, or premises are unfit for other use; (B) to administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence; and (C) to investigate the dwelling and other property conditions and to enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations when the Public Officer has reasonable grounds for believing they are unfit for human habitation, or for other use; provided, that such entries shall be made in such manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession, and to obtain an order for this purpose after submitting evidence in support of an application which is adequate to justify such an order from a court of competent jurisdiction in the event entry is denied or resisted; provided further, that the Public Officer may recognize and give appropriate effect to special and extenuating circumstances which, in order to do substantial justice, warrant the exercise of discretion to adjust the time frames, standards and other provisions of this chapter. Examples of circumstances which may warrant such exercise of discretion include, without limitation, medical illness or disability affecting a property owner’s ability to respond to orders or appear at hearings and bona fide insurance coverage disputes which create a definite risk that enforcement of this chapter would unfairly result in a substantial economic loss to the property owner.

(Ord. 723 § 4 (Exh. D), 2020).

M. Any building or structure has been constructed, exists, or is maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable to such building or structure provided by the building regulations of this jurisdiction, as specified in the building code, Chapter 14.05 UPMC, or of any other law of this State or ordinance of the City relating to the condition, location, or structure of buildings.

N. Any building or structure, which, whether or not erected in accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, has in any nonsupporting part, member, or portion less than 50 percent or in any supporting part, member, or portion less than 66 percent of the (1) strength, (2) fire-resisting qualities or characteristics, or (3) weather-resisting qualities or characteristics required by law for newly constructed buildings of like area, height, and occupancy in the same location.

T. Any other condition the Building Official or other official or expert can articulate that renders the structure unsafe or unfit for habitation or occupancy.

(Ord. 723 § 4 (Exh. D), 2020).


9.60.050 Inspection and complaint.

If, after a preliminary investigation of any dwelling, building, structure, or premises, the Public Officer finds that it is dangerous or unfit for human habitation or other use, he shall cause to be served either personally or by certified mail, with return receipt requested, upon all persons having any interest therein, as shown upon the records of the Pierce County Auditor, and shall post in a conspicuous place on such property, a complaint stating in what respects such dwelling, building, structure, or premises is unfit for human habitation or other use. If the whereabouts of any of such persons is unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the Public Officer in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Public Officer makes an affidavit to that effect, then the serving of such complaint or order upon such persons may be made either by personal service or by mailing a copy of the complaint and order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each such person at the address of the building involved in the proceedings, and mailing a copy of the complaint and order by first class mail to any address of each such person in the records of the Pierce County Treasurer-Assessor or Auditor. Such complaint shall contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the Public Officer, at a place therein fixed, not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint; and that all parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint, to appear in person, or otherwise, and to give testimony at the time and place in the complaint. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Public Officer. A copy of such complaint shall also be filed with the Pierce County Auditor and such filing of the complaint or order shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law.

(Ord. 723 § 4 (Exh. D), 2020).


9.60.060 Findings and order.

A. If, after the required hearing, the Public Officer determines that the dwelling is dangerous or unfit for human habitation, or building or structure or premises is unfit for other appropriate use, he/she shall state in writing his/her findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owners and parties in interest thereof, as provided in UPMC 9.60.050, and shall post in a conspicuous place on the property an order that (1) requires the owners and parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or premises to render it fit for human habitation, or for other appropriate use, or to vacate and close the dwelling, building, structure, or premises, if such course of action is deemed proper on the basis of the standards set forth in UPMC 9.60.040; or (2) requires the owners and parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building, structure, or premises, if this course of action is deemed proper on the basis of those standards. If no appeal is filed, a copy of such order shall be filed with the Pierce County Auditor.

B. In ordering the required course of action to be taken by the owner to abate the unfit or dangerous structure, the Public Officer may order the structure or a portion thereof demolished and not repaired under the following circumstances:

The value of the structure shall be as determined by the Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer. In estimating the cost of repairing the structure, the Public Officer may rely upon such cost estimating publication or method the Public Official deems appropriate.

(Ord. 723 § 4 (Exh. D), 2020).

The City has a variety of responsibilities pursuant to the requirements of RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.551. The City commute trip reduction plan addresses these responsibilities and establishes the goals for the City and the CTR-affected employers as set forth in Attachment A adopted hereby and on file with the city clerk.

(Ord. 528 § 2 (Exh. A), 2008).


10.50.040 Responsible City agency.

(Ord. 528 § 2 (Exh. A), 2008).


10.50.050 Applicability.

A. Affected Employer. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any affected employer at any single worksite within the limits set forth in the City commute trip reduction plan.

B. Change in Status as an Affected Employer. Any of the following changes in an employer’s status may change the employer’s CTR program requirements:

1. Change from Affected to a Nonaffected Status. If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees and expects not to employ 100 or more affected employees for the next 12 months, that employer is no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the City in writing that it is no longer an affected employer and provide supporting evidence.

2. Change in Status within a 12-Month Period. If an employer drops below the threshold and then returns to the threshold level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months, and will be subject to the program requirements as other affected employers.

3. Change in Status After a 12-Month Period. If an employer drops below the threshold and then returns to the threshold level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an unaffected employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer.

C. Newly Affected Employers.

1. Identification. Newly affected employers must identify themselves to the City within 90 days of either moving into the boundaries as set forth in the City CTR plan or growing in employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the City of its affected employer status. Newly affected employers who do not identify themselves within 90 days will be considered to be in violation of this chapter.

2. Survey. Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given 90 days to perform a baseline measurement. The employer shall utilize the State-provided survey measurement tool or State-approved equivalent format and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from employees at the worksite.

For the purposes of this chapter, an employer shall not be required to survey more than once in a 12-month period.

G. Record Keeping. Affected employers shall maintain a copy of official correspondences between the employer and the City, their measurement results, and all supporting documentation for the descriptions and assertions made in any CTR report to the City for a minimum of 24 months. The City and the employer shall agree on the record keeping requirements as part of the accepted CTR program.

(Ord. 528 § 2 (Exh. A), 2008).


10.50.080 Program modifications and exemptions.

A. At any time, any affected employer may request that the City grant a modification from a CTR program requirement other than designation of the employee transportation coordinator, information distribution, surveying, and annual reports.

B. Modification of individual program measures shall not exempt an affected employer from complying with other required program measures.

1. Employee Adjustment. Groups of employees (a) who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment, or (b) who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts may be exempted from a worksite’s survey measurement. Affected employees who are exempted from a worksite’s CTR program shall be counted when determining the total number of affected employees at the worksite.

2. Hardship. A one-year program waiver may be granted if and only if an affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that would reduce the proportion of drive alone trips or average VMT per employee.

C. Affected Employer May Request a CTR Program Modification or Waiver at Any Time. The Department shall review such requests and notify the employer of its decision in writing within 30 days of the date the Department receives the written request. The Department shall review annually all modifications and exemptions and shall determine whether they will remain in effect during the following program year.

(Ord. 528 § 2 (Exh. A), 2008).


10.50.090 Review of commute trip reduction programs.

A. Newly Affected Employer. The first annual report submitted by a newly affected employer shall be accepted by the Department as long as it addresses necessary baseline information and all required elements including elements likely to result in reductions in drive alone trips or reduction in average VMT.

B. Review and Evaluation. The Department’s review and evaluation will address the employer’s good faith efforts toward meeting the CTR goals. Consequently, programs may be deemed acceptable or unacceptable based on the employer’s progress in reducing commute trips, as measured by reduction in drive alone trips or reduction in average VMT. The employer shall provide adequate information and documentation of program implementation when requested by the City.

C. Document Review. Within 90 days of the date the Department receives an employer’s CTR program annual report, the Department shall provide the employer with written notification of whether a CTR program is deemed acceptable or unacceptable. If the CTR program is deemed unacceptable, the notification must give cause for the rejection. The Department may extend the review period up to 90 days. If the review period is extended, the implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.

D. Review Criteria. The City shall use the following criteria to determine whether an affected employer shall be required to make modifications to its CTR program:

1. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and meets or exceeds either the applicable drive alone or VMT reduction goal, the employer has satisfied the objectives of this chapter and will not be required to modify its CTR program.

2. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but fails to meet both the applicable drive alone and VMT reduction goals, the City shall work collaboratively with the employer to implement program modifications likely to result in improvements to the program over an agreed-upon length of time.

3. If an employer fails to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet both the applicable drive alone and VMT reduction goals, the City shall work collaboratively with the employer to identify modifications to the CTR program and shall direct the employer to revise its program accordingly and submit the revised program to the City within 30 days.

E. Request for Conference. Within 10 days of receipt of written notice for an unacceptable CTR program, the City or employer may request a conference to discuss the Department’s decision. This conference shall be scheduled during official City hours.

F. Implementation of CTR Program Modifications. If the City proposes modifications to an affected employer’s CTR program due to the CTR program’s unacceptability, the affected employer shall have 30 days to submit a revised CTR program that includes the proposed or other mutually agreed modifications.

G. Employer Intent to Modify. The employer shall notify the City in writing of its intent to substantially change or modify its approved program. Within 30 days, the City will review the request. If found unacceptable, the City shall work collaboratively with the employer to design program modifications likely to result in improvements to the program over an agreed-upon length of time.

H. Leadership Certificate. Employers who meet at least one goal will receive a commute trip reduction certificate of leadership from the City.

(Ord. 528 § 2 (Exh. A), 2008).


10.50.100 Enforcement and penalties.

A. Compliance. For purposes of this chapter, “compliance” shall mean fully implementing all provisions in an approved CTR program or being determined to have made a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter.

2. Penalty Amount. The penalty for a notice of civil violation is up to $500.00 per day, pursuant to this code.

3. Penalty Accrual. Penalties will begin to accrue following the issuance of City’s notice of civil violation. In the event that an affected employer appeals the imposition of penalties, the penalties will not accrue during the appeal process. Should the Hearings Examiner decide in favor of the appellant, all or a portion of the monetary penalties may be dismissed.

4. Union Negotiations. An employer shall not be liable for civil penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. Unionized employers shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if they:

a. Propose to a recognized union any provisions of the employer’s CTR program that are subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and

b. Advise the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by the City and advise the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with this chapter and State law (RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.551).

5. Violation Notification. Whenever the Department makes a determination that an affected employer is in violation of this chapter, the City shall notify the employer in writing.

B. Criteria. The Hearings Examiner will evaluate employers’ appeals of administrative decisions by determining whether the Department’s decisions were consistent with CTR law, Chapter 468-60 WAC and this chapter. An appeal may be granted if the employer can show:

1. That the violation for which the penalty was imposed occurred for reasons beyond the control of the employer.

2. That the measures that the Department directed the employer to incorporate into its CTR program are unlikely to reduce the proportion of drive alone trips or VMT per employee.

C. Judicial Appeal. An affected employer may appeal any decision of the Hearings Examiner to the Pierce County District Court and any such appeal shall be limited to the record made before the Hearings Examiner.

(Ord. 528 § 2 (Exh. A), 2008).

12.10.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect the City’s surface and ground water quality by providing minimum requirements for reducing and controlling the discharge of contaminants. The City Council recognizes that water quality degradation can result either directly from one discharge or through the collective impact of many small discharges. Therefore, this chapter prohibits the discharge of contaminants into surface and storm water and ground water, and outlines preventive measures to restrict contaminants from entering such waters. These measures include the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) by the residents of the City of University Place.

The City Council finds this chapter is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of University Place and the integrity of the City’s resources for the benefit of all by: minimizing or eliminating water quality degradation; preserving and enhancing the suitability of waters for recreation, fishing, and other beneficial uses; and preserving and enhancing the aesthetic quality and biotic integrity of the water. The City Council recognizes that implementation of this chapter is required under the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. In meeting the intent of the Clean Water Act, the City Council also recognizes the importance of maintaining economic viability while providing necessary environmental protection and believes this chapter helps achieve both goals. 

(Ord. 554 § 1, 2009; Ord. 41 § 1, 1995. Formerly 12.10.005).

U. “Source control BMP” means a BMP to prevent contaminants from entering surface and storm water and/or ground water including the modification of processes to eliminate the production or use of contaminants. Source control BMPs can be either structural or nonstructural. Structural source control BMPs involve the construction of a physical structure on site, or other type of physical modification to a site; for example, building a covered storage area. A nonstructural source control BMP involves the modification or addition of managerial or behavioral practices; for example, using less toxic alternatives to current products or sweeping parking lots.

V. “State waste discharge permit” means an authorization, license, or equivalent control document issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology in accordance with Chapter 173-216 WAC.

W. “Storm Water Manual” or “Manual” means the Manual and supporting documents as appropriate describing best management practices, design, maintenance, procedures, and guidance for storm water management which has been adopted by the City.

X. “Storm water drainage facility” means the facilities, including the City’s municipal separate storm sewer system, by which storm water is collected and/or conveyed, including but not limited to any roads with drainage, municipal streets, gutters, curbs, inlets, piped storm drains, pumping facilities, retention and detention basins, natural and human-made or altered drainage channels, reservoirs, and other drainage structures. Storm drainage systems may be both public and private.

A. Best Management Practices.

1. The KCSWDM presents the BMPs and the standards and procedures for existing facilities and activities and for new development activities not covered by the City’s Public Works Code. The Manual describes the types of regulated activities; the types of contaminants generated by each activity, and the contaminant’s effect on water quality; the required source control BMPs and available treatment BMPs; and a schedule for BMP implementation.

2. Property owners are responsible for the maintenance, operation and repair of storm water facilities and the BMPs within their property. Property owners shall maintain, operate and repair these facilities in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the City’s Storm Water Manual. 

3. The Director shall apply and implement the BMPs within the KCSWDM as follows. The Director shall first require the implementation of nonstructural source control BMPs. If these are not sufficient to prevent contaminants from entering surface and storm water or ground water, the Director may require implementation of structural source control BMPs or of treatment BMPs, utilizing AKART. 

B. Exemptions.

1. Persons implementing BMPs through another federal, state or local program will not be required to implement the BMPs prescribed in the City’s Storm Water Manual, unless the Director determines the alternative BMPs to be ineffective at reducing the discharge or contaminants. If the other program requires the development of a plan, the person shall make their plan available to the City upon request. Persons who qualify for exemptions include, but are not limited to, persons who are:

a. Required to obtain a general or individual NPDES permit for storm water discharges from the Washington State Department of Ecology;

b. Implementing and maintaining, as scheduled, a Pierce County conservation district- approved farm management plan;

c. Permitted under a Washington State Department of Ecology NPDES general or individual permit for commercial dairy operations;

2. Existing Commercial or Multifamily Buildings Wishing to Build Screens or Enclosures. The requirement to have a screen or enclosure shall not be imposed retroactively on existing buildings. Nonetheless, the owner or manager of any commercial or multifamily building who wishes to build an enclosure or screen should consult with the refuse hauler to ensure that an enclosure or screen is built to acceptable standards. Failure to build a suitable screen or enclosure may result in the disruption of service until the building owner makes corrections at his or her expense. 

(Ord. 128 § 4, 1996).


12.20.050 Limitations on refuse collection services.

A. Refusal of Service. An authorized hauler may refuse to provide service if:

1. Street, Road or Driveway Conditions. The hauler believes the condition of a private street, private road, or private driveway makes it impractical or dangerous to persons or property to operate refuse vehicles. For example, inadequate turnaround space may make it impractical for a refuse truck to enter a driveway.

2. Vicious Animal. Hauler may refuse to enter private property to pick up solid waste while an animal considered or feared to be vicious is loose. The customer is required to confine the animal on pickup days.

3. Placement of Refuse Containers or Cans. Hauler may refuse to collect cans from curbside customers which are located more than five feet away from the curb or edge of the roadway.

4. Leaking or Damaged Containers or Cans. Hauler may refuse to collect solid waste from leaking or damaged containers.

5. Improperly Constructed Screen or Enclosure Around Container(s). If a screen or enclosure is built around a solid waste container(s) in such a way as to hamper access or to make access unsafe, then the hauler may refuse service until corrections are made.

6. Excessive Weight. The hauler reserves the right to refuse pickup if the following weights are exceeded:

a. Residential Units. 

	10-gallon container (micro-can)	20 pounds

	20-gallon container 	40 pounds

	32-gallon container	65 pounds

b. Commercial or Multifamily Yard Containers. 

	90-gallon yard waste containers	200 pounds

	Rear load commercial containers	250 pounds per yard

c. Packer or Drop Boxes. Hauler reserves the right to reject pickup of any stationary packer or drop box which, upon reasonable inspection:

i. Appears to be overloaded; and/or

ii. Would cause applicable vehicle load limitations to be exceeded; or

iii. If transported by the collector, would violate load limitation on vehicle operation; or

iv. Negatively impacts or otherwise damages road surface integrity.

7. Notification. If the hauler refuses to collect solid waste for any of the above reasons, the hauler shall leave a note on the solid waste container explaining the reason why the solid waste was not collected. If conditions such as a vicious animal make it impractical to leave a note on the container itself, then the hauler will be required to send a letter within three business days explaining why the hauler was unable to provide service.

B. Missed or Skipped Days of Service.

1. Weather or Poor Road Conditions. A hauler may fail to pick up refuse on a designated day if weather or poor road conditions makes it unsafe to provide service. As long as the uncollected solid waste is collected on the next regularly scheduled service date, no credit will be given to a customer’s account. Such uncollected solid waste placed at curbside by customer on the next regularly scheduled service date will be collected by hauler at no additional charge to customer.

2. Holidays. When pickup is missed due to the hauler’s observance of a holiday, hauler will provide service on an alternate day at no additional cost to the customer.

C. Litter or Debris Around Solid Waste Containers. Hauler is not responsible for cleaning litter, debris, or other solid waste scattered around solid waste cans or containers. Hauler is solely responsible for the collection and disposal of solid wastes located within proper containers.

D. Hauler Not Responsible for Articles Left Near Cans. Other than to offer reasonable care, the hauler assumes no responsibility for articles left on or near refuse cans or containers.

E. Damages Outside the Control of the Hauler. Where a hauler is requested to provide service, and damage occurs to a customer’s driveway due to reasons not in the control of the hauler, the hauler will assume no responsibility. 

(Ord. 128 § 5, 1996).


12.20.060 Recycling.

A. Residential Recycling. Residential can customers who sign up for recycling service will receive one container for newspaper, mixed paper, plastics, tin, and aluminum cans to be placed at the curb on a scheduled two-week cycle. The day of the week assigned for recycling pickup shall be the same week day assigned for solid waste pickup. In other words, if a hauler picks up a customer’s solid waste on Tuesday, then recycling pickup shall also occur on Tuesdays.

B. Multifamily Recycling. Recycling service is a mandatory service for residents living in multiple-family dwellings whose owners or managers have elected to sign up for recycling service. An appropriate size and number of outdoor collection sites and/or recycling containers will be provided by the company for each multiple-family dwelling. Materials to be collected are: newspaper, mixed paper, cardboard, plastics, tin and aluminum cans.

C. Recycling as a Means for Minimizing City’s Waste Stream. Whereas the city supports recycling as a means for minimizing the city’s waste stream, the city’s policy is to create financial incentives for recycling through the structuring of rates.

D. Anti-Scavenging of Recyclables. Once residential recyclable materials and residential yard waste materials have been set out on the curbside or at other locations as authorized by the city, ownership of those recyclable and yard waste materials passes to the refuse hauler. It shall be unlawful for any person other than the hauler to remove or collect any such recyclable materials or yard waste materials once they are set out on the curbside or other approved location. However, any occupant may donate recyclable and yard waste materials to any noncommercial entity or may provide or deliver to such entities recyclable or yard waste materials delivered to a location where it is legal to accept such materials. Such donations shall not be placed curbside in hauler-provided recycling containers. 

(Ord. 426 § 1, 2004; Ord. 128 § 6, 1996).


12.20.070 Yard waste.

A. Yard Waste Collection. Haulers will collect yard waste from yard waste customers on a scheduled two-week cycle. The day of the week assigned for yard waste pickup shall be the same week day assigned for solid waste pickup. In other words, if a hauler picks up a customer’s solid waste on Thursday, then recycling pickup shall also occur on Thursdays.

B. Yard Waste Mixed with Other Wastes Will Not Be Collected as Yard Waste. Hauler will not collect yard waste, if the yard waste is mixed with other materials. Hauler will leave a note on the container explaining why it could not be collected. If customer is unable to separate out yard waste, then customer may place the mixed yard waste into a regular refuse can. Hauler will bill the pickup of mixed yard waste from a refuse can at regular can rates.

C. Yard Waste Container. Hauler will provide a 90-gallon container to each yard waste customer. 

(Ord. 128 § 7, 1996).


12.20.080 Materials requiring special disposal, handling, equipment, or other precautions.

A. Conformance to Local, State, and Federal Requirements.

As used in this section, “dangerous or hazardous waste” means any solid waste designated as dangerous or hazardous waste by the State Department of Ecology under Chapters 70.105 and 70.105A RCW. Hauler is not responsible for collecting or disposing of any hazardous or dangerous wastes. The generator of hazardous or dangerous wastes is responsible for disposing of such wastes in compliance with Washington Department of Ecology rules and regulations.

C. Infectious Wastes. Customers must make special arrangements for the collection of infectious wastes. Such arrangements shall not interfere with the city’s franchise obligations. It is unlawful to deposit infectious wastes into regular refuse containers.

D. Testing. When a hauler or disposal facility determines that testing and/or analysis of any solid waste is required to determine whether hazardous, prohibited, or other dangerous wastes are present, the actual costs for such testing and/or analysis will be paid by the customer.

E. Special Materials May Be Subject to Higher Rates. Hauler shall not collect any hazardous or dangerous wastes with the exception of infectious wastes. Hauler may collect infectious wastes, if special arrangements are made for such collection.

Hauler may collect other nonhazardous, special materials, but such materials may be subject to time charges or other special fees. Examples of special materials include loose and/or bulky materials, demolition materials, car or truck tires, and appliances. A complete list of special materials subject to extra charges or fees is available at both City Hall and the offices of authorized refuse haulers, and may be amended from time-to-time upon approval by the city manager or designee.

F. Dead Animals Weighing More Than Three Pounds. It shall be the duty of every person in possession, charge, or control of any dead animal or upon whose premises the same may be located to forthwith cause the dead animal to be removed and properly disposed of by the Humane Society or a licensed veterinarian and to pay the required disposal fee.

(Ord. 128 § 9, 1996).


12.20.100 Presumption of responsibility for unlawful disposal or dumping.

A person is presumed to be responsible for illegally depositing litter or debris upon a property or public right-of-way by the discovery of two or more pieces of litter within such illegally deposited litter which are identifiable to such person by means of a name, address or other mark of identification contained on such items.

A. A financial guarantee is financial security posted with the City to ensure timely and proper completion of improvements, to ensure compliance with this code, and/or to warranty the design, materials, and workmanship associated with improvements. Financial guarantees include assignments of funds, surety bonds, and other forms of financial security acceptable to the City. Other types of financial guarantees may be accepted if approved by the Director. For the purposes of this title, the terms “performance guarantee,” “street use guarantee,” “erosion and sediment control/street cleaning guarantee,” and “maintenance and defect guarantee” are considered subcategories of financial guarantees.

An engineer’s estimate prepared by the applicant’s engineer shall detail the quantity of work to be done and shall be presented in a format approved by the City. The estimate shall be based on current construction costs and shall be stamped and signed by the engineer. The Director may consider any other reliable evidence in the Director’s sole discretion in determining the amount of the financial guarantee.

E. If a property for which a financial guarantee has been posted with the City is sold or otherwise transferred, the applicant is responsible for transferring the financial guarantee liability by having the new owner(s) replace any existing financial guarantees that the City is holding. The City will not release a preexisting financial guarantee until such time as the City accepts a replacement guarantee.

F. The property owner may be required to complete and record a right of entry form prior to acceptance of any financial guarantee covering improvements on private property. The right of entry shall run with the land and shall be recorded with the Pierce County Auditor.

G. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the Director may release a financial guarantee where the work associated with the guarantee has been completed, the work has been stabilized such that there is no further risk to existing facilities, all fees have been paid, and a sufficient time has elapsed that the Director has determined that it is likely that neither the applicant nor surety will make a request to release the guarantee.

H. All financial guarantees must be reviewed and approved as to form by the City Attorney.

13.05.640 Erosion and sediment control/street cleaning guarantee. 

A. An erosion and sediment control/street cleaning guarantee ensures that required erosion and sedimentation control/street cleaning measures are constructed and maintained in accordance with the UPMC. Prior to permit issuance, the applicant must submit to the City a financial guarantee that guarantees the performance and maintenance of the erosion and sedimentation control facilities and street cleaning. Because of the harm to the public health and safety and the environment arising out of poor erosion and sediment control or failure to clean streets properly, all erosion and sediment control/street cleaning guarantees shall require that the guarantor must pay the face amount of the financial guarantee to the City within 14 days of the City’s written demand for funds.

B. If the applicant fails to maintain the erosion and sedimentation control facilities in conformance with this code, the City may issue a written notice specifying required remedial actions. If the remedial actions are not performed in a timely manner, the City may take action including, but not limited to, issuing a stop work order, entering the property to perform the actions needed; and using the financial guarantee to pay for remedial actions. In the event a hazard exists, the City is not required to provide written notice to the applicant. If the City is forced to utilize the guarantee, any stop work order issued shall remain in effect until the applicant has restored the guarantee up to either the original amount or such other amount as the Director may reasonably decide is necessary to ensure future compliance with the permit.

C. The amount of the guarantee will be as follows:

1. For any development larger than one single-family or duplex building: 125 percent of the cost of the approved erosion and sedimentation control measures, plus $5,000 per acre of the disturbed area.

Article I. General Considerations


13.20.110 Purpose. 

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the development of an integrated, uniform, multimodal, fully accessible transportation system that facilitates present and future travel demand with minimal environmental impact to the community.

A. The design objective for vehicular zones is to create a circulation system that provides for the safe and efficient movement of vehicles and reduces conflict with pedestrians and bicyclists and to provide roadway standards that will help create streets that are inviting, multimodal public places.

B. The design objective for pedestrian zones is to provide a high level of design detail, promote walkability by improving pedestrian safety, convenience, and comfort, and enhance the aesthetic character and quality of the pedestrian experience.

(Ord. 565 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).


13.20.120 Additional design standards.

The “City of University Place Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements” are contained in Article IX, Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements.

These standards and guidelines apply to neighborhood collector streets and local streets associated with new development as well as qualifying modifications to existing development.

(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 565 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).


13.20.130 Standardized format for traffic analyses.

A. Introduction. A traffic impact analysis (TIA) is a specialized study of the impacts that a certain type and size of development will have on the surrounding transportation system. The TIA is an integral part of the development impact review process. It is specifically concerned with the generation and distribution of traffic to and from the development.

The purpose of the TIA is to determine the impacts of the development traffic on the existing and proposed street network and the impacts of the existing and projected traffic on the development. The level of detail and scope of work of a TIA may vary with the size, complexity, and location of the development. A TIA shall be a thorough review of the immediate and long-range traffic impacts. The Director may accept the TIA as satisfying the requirements for a concurrency test as identified in UPMC Title 22.

B. When Required. To adequately assess a development’s traffic impact on the transportation system and level of service (LOS), the Director may require a TIA based upon the evaluation of the size of the development proposed, existing street and intersection conditions, traffic volumes, accident history, community concerns, and other pertinent factors relating to traffic impacts attributable to the development. A TIA will be required if any of the following conditions are met:

1. The development generates 20 or more trips in either the a.m. or p.m. peak hours. This would include site-generated traffic for all turning movements for the peak hours at all affected intersections.

2. The development lies within an area that contains an existing or proposed local improvement district (LID), local/State transportation improvement areas programmed for development reimbursements or at locations that have latecomer agreements.

3. If a TIA exists but is more than two years old, the Director may require a new or revised TIA prior to permit issuance.

C. Qualifications for Preparing TIA. The TIA shall be prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in the State of Washington with special training and experience in traffic engineering.

D. Submittal Requirements. The TIA shall at a minimum include the following sections: Introduction, Existing Conditions, Development Traffic, Future Traffic, Traffic Operations, and Mitigation. The sections shall at a minimum incorporate the information identified below.

1. Introduction.

a. Provide a statement of the scope of the analysis and identify the limits of the study area. The study area shall include all pertinent intersections and streets impacted by development traffic. This shall include, but not be limited to, any signalized intersection within the City within one mile of the development at which the development-generated traffic equals 10 or more vehicle trips at any peak hour, or any signalized intersection in the City at which the development-generated traffic is 10 percent or more of the volume of existing traffic through the intersection at any peak hour. The Director may also require that the study area include any intersection that currently operates at a LOS of “D” or lower and at which the development-generated traffic is 10 or more vehicle trips at any peak hour. The study area may be expanded outside the City limits if determined necessary by the Director under any environmental review required under the State Environmental Policy Act.

b. Provide a copy of the site plan showing the type of development, street system, rights-of-way limits, access points, and other features of significance in the development. The site plan shall also include pertinent off-site information such as locations of adjacent intersections and driveways, land use descriptions, street right-of-way limits for the existing roadways and other features of significance.



c. Provide a vicinity map of the project area showing the transportation system to be impacted by the development.

d. Address specific development characteristics such as type of development proposed (single-family, multifamily, retail, industrial, etc.), internal street network, proposed access locations, parking requirements, zoning, and other pertinent characteristics of the development.

e. Indicate project completion and occupancy schedule for the development. Identify horizon years for traffic analysis purposes.

2. Existing Conditions.

a. Identify street characteristics including functional classification, number of traveled lanes, lane width, shoulder treatment, bicycle path corridors and traffic control at study intersections.

b. Identify safety and access issues including discussions on accident history, sight distance restrictions, traffic control, and pedestrian conflicts.

c. Provide all necessary traffic data including any current data available from the City of University Place and surrounding jurisdictions if applicable. If data is unavailable or outdated, the individual or firm preparing the TIA shall collect the necessary data.

d. Provide a diagram showing existing average daily traffic (ADT) and a.m. and p.m. peak-hour traffic volumes on the adjacent streets and intersections and illustrating complete turning movement volumes within the study area. This diagram shall represent the baseline traffic volumes for analysis purposes.

3. Development Traffic.

a. Trip Generation. Site-generated traffic of developments shall be estimated using the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. Variations of trip rates will require the approval of the Director. Trip rate equations will be utilized for estimating site-generated traffic. Average trip rates shall be used for all land use categories where applicable or required by the Director. Site traffic shall be generated for a.m. and p.m. peak-hour periods. Adjustments made for passer-by and mixed-use traffic volumes shall follow the methodology outlined in the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. For multi-use or phased projects, a trip generation table shall be prepared showing proposed land use, trip rates, and vehicle trips for daily and peak-hour periods and appropriate traffic volume discounts if applicable. The TIA shall contain a table illustrating the trip generation.

b. Trip Distribution. The TIA shall contain a diagram illustrating the proposed trip distribution for the development. The methodology shall be clearly defined and discussed in detail in the TIA. A regional trip distribution map may be required by the Director for large-scale development projects. The TIA shall identify other transportation modes that may be applicable, such as transit use, bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

4. Future Traffic.

a. Future Traffic Conditions Without Project. Future traffic volumes shall be estimated using information from transportation models for applying an annual growth rate based on reports of the Puget Sound Regional Council to baseline traffic volumes. The future traffic volumes shall be representative of the horizon year for project development. Proposed development projects approved, under review, or otherwise reasonably foreseeable shall be taken into consideration when forecasting future traffic volumes.

b. Future Traffic Conditions with Project. The site-generated traffic shall be assigned to the street network in the study area based on the approved trip distribution model. The site traffic shall be combined with the forecasted traffic volume to show the total traffic conditions estimated at the horizon year. A diagram will be required showing daily and a.m. and p.m. peak-hour turning movement volumes for each intersection in the study area.

5. Traffic Operations. The LOS and capacity analysis shall be conducted for each intersection in the study area. The methodology and procedures for conducting the capacity analysis shall follow the guidelines specified in the Highway Capacity Manual. The TIA shall include calculations for the intersection LOS for each of the following conditions:

a. Existing peak-hour traffic volumes (diagram required);

b. Existing peak-hour traffic volumes including site-generated traffic (diagram required);

c. Future traffic volumes not including site traffic (diagram required);

d. Future traffic volumes including site traffic (diagram required);

e. The LOS analysis results for each traffic volume scenario (table required). The LOS table shall include LOS results for a.m. and p.m. peak periods. The table shall show LOS conditions with corresponding vehicle delays for signalized intersections and LOS conditions for the critical movements at unsignalized intersections. For signalized intersections, the LOS conditions and average vehicle delay shall be provided for each approach and the intersection as a whole. The capacity analyses for existing signalized intersections shall include existing phasing, timing, splits and cycle lengths in the analysis as observed and measured during the peak-hour traffic periods. If the development is scheduled to be completed in phases, the TIA shall conduct a LOS analysis for each separate development phase. The incremental increases in site traffic from each phase shall be included in the LOS analysis for each proceeding year of development completion. A figure will be required for each horizon year of phased development. If the development impacts a traffic signal coordination system currently in operation, the Director may require the TIA to include operational analysis of the system. Timing plans and proposed modifications to the coordination system may be required. The capacity analysis shall be conducted using a City-approved software package. The computer worksheets, along with an electronic copy of each capacity analysis, shall be submitted with the TIA document. For unsignalized intersections, the Highway Capacity Manual methodology shall be used. A copy of the capacity analyses worksheets shall be submitted with the TIA document.

6. Mitigation. The TIA shall include a proposed mitigation plan. Mitigating measures shall ensure the transportation facilities operate at a LOS “D” or better upon completion of the development. The following guidelines shall be used to determine appropriate mitigating measures of traffic impacts generated by new developments.

a. On transportation facilities where the TIA demonstrates a need to construct improvements, the cost for the mitigation will be entirely borne by the applicant. However, if the Director identifies more than one development under simultaneous review, cumulative impacts and distribution of mitigation costs may be considered. A latecomer’s agreement could be formulated by the applicant for reimbursement for mitigation costs.

b. On transportation facilities programmed for improvements and funded as part of a City project, the adverse traffic impacts of the development may be considered mitigated by providing a proportionate share contribution of the costs for the proposed improvements. The proportionate share of local costs for the improvements shall be based on the percentage of development traffic generated through the intersection. The percentage shall be based on the total projected peak hour traffic volumes for the horizon year of the transportation facility. For the purposes of this section, transportation facilities included on the traffic impact fee project list will be considered programmed and funded. For these facilities, payment of the traffic impact fee will satisfy the requirement for providing a proportionate share contribution of the costs for the improvements. If the transportation facility currently operates less than LOS “D,” and the Director determines that the impacts of the development will create a safety hazard, the applicant shall be required to make facility improvements to improve the level of service to LOS “D” or better. The cost of the interim improvements will be deducted from the development’s proportionate share of costs for the programmed facility improvements only if the cost of the interim improvements is less than the ultimate proportionate share. If the interim improvements cannot be incorporated into the ultimate improvements programmed for the transportation facility, there will be no reimbursement for interim costs incurred.

c. On transportation facilities where the existing LOS is less than “D” and where no improvements are programmed to improve capacity and traffic operations, the development shall provide mitigation that ensures the intersection operates at LOS “D” or better or wait until the improvements are constructed by the City or others.

d. Intersections where the projected level of service condition is at “D,” but where one or more of the LOS on the approaches falls below “D,” the development shall provide mitigation that ensures each approach operates at LOS “D” or better.

e. To mitigate the effects of the traffic generated by the development and the effects of that traffic on existing vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic, the applicant shall provide sufficient right-of-way for and construct paved shoulders/bicycle lanes on abutting streets that are arterial streets or designated bicycle routes.

f. To mitigate the effects of the traffic generated by the development and the effects of that traffic on existing vehicular and pedestrian traffic, planter strips and concrete curbs, gutters, and sidewalks shall be constructed along abutting streets. Planter strips, concrete curbs, gutters, and sidewalks are required along each side of all interior plat roads in formal subdivisions to provide for the safety of pedestrians. To mitigate pedestrian impacts, a bus stop shelter on a concrete pad shall be constructed where Pierce Transit and/or the school district has identified a need for a bus stop to serve the development and the citizens of the City. Design standards for the bus shelter shall be provided by Pierce Transit or the school district.

(Ord. 531 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 505 § 1, 2007; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).


13.20.140 Developments on substandard streets.

A. The applicant shall be required to construct improvements to bring substandard streets up to current City standards prior to final approval for any development that obtains access from substandard public or private streets. Such improvements shall be made from the point of access to the closest intersection of an arterial street. Street improvements may include but are not limited to curb and gutter, sidewalk, street lighting, traffic signal modification, relocation or installation, utility relocation, street widening, and resurfacing.

B. Exceptions.

1. Any development that does not generate additional vehicular traffic is exempt from the requirements of this section.

2. The construction of or modification to a single-family or duplex residential unit will require the access to be improved up to emergency vehicle access standards in Article III of this chapter.

3. The development of short subdivisions that accommodate no more than four dwelling units will require the substandard street to be improved up to 20 feet of paved driving surface and five-foot gravel shoulders on each side of the street, provided any new dwelling units are equipped with residential fire suppression sprinkler systems.

(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).


13.20.150 Street frontage improvements.

A. Street frontage improvements shall be required in conjunction with subdivisions and short subdivisions of land, small lot and innovative housing developments, planned development districts, conditional use permits, binding site plans, and the modification or construction of buildings. Frontage improvements shall consist of half-street improvements in conformance with the standard street section and the City street standards in Article II of this chapter and the Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements adopted by reference. Such improvements may include curbs, gutters, bike lanes, planter strips, medians, sidewalks, bus stops, bus shelters, bus pads, bus pullouts, street storm drainage, street lighting systems, traffic signal installation, modification, or relocation, utility relocation, landscaping, irrigation, and street widening.

B. Plans shall be stamped by a civil engineer licensed to practice in the State of Washington.

C. Where the existing right-of-way is of insufficient width to accommodate the required improvements, right-of-way dedication will be required. The dedications shall comply with the provisions of UPMC 13.10.030. For plats, the right-of-way may be dedicated at the time of recording.

D. All frontage improvements shall be completed in a manner acceptable to the City prior to occupancy, final plat approval, final short plat approval, final development plan approval, or binding site plan approval.

E. Exceptions.

1. When the Director determines based on good reasons shown that any or all of the required improvements should not be accomplished at the time specified in subsection (D) of this section, a recorded agreement or financial guarantee shall be completed on forms provided by the City. The agreement shall require the applicant to install the improvements at a later date.

2. The construction, remodeling or enlargement of an individual Group R3 or Group U occupancy (as defined in the building code) shall be exempt from this section.

3. Alterations or repairs not constituting a major improvement are exempt from this section. See UPMC 13.05.220 for the definition of “major improvement.”

4. Major improvements that add less than 10 percent floor area and which value does not exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the existing structure shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. Alterations or repairs completed within the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of permit application shall be considered as part of the current proposal and their costs shall be included in considering the applicability of this exemption.

5. Two- or three-lot short plats accessing local streets and two-lot short plats accessing arterial streets may elect to defer the construction of the required frontage improvements by completing and recording the City of University Place LID Covenant. By recording this covenant the property owner agrees to participate in and not protest the formation of a local improvement district on the abutting streets. Nothing in the covenant will in any way absolve the property owner from the obligation to improve the frontage of the property. If it becomes necessary to mitigate the effects of the development prior to the formation of an LID, the property owner will have 120 days from receipt of the written notice from the City to complete the required improvements. If right-of-way dedication will be necessary to construct the standard street section, the right-of-way shall be dedicated upon recording of the short plat.

(Ord. 565 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).

Article II. Streets


13.20.205 General. 

Street design must provide for the maximum loading conditions anticipated. The width and grade of the pavement must conform to specific standards set forth herein for safety and uniformity.

As feasible, University Place shall incorporate complete streets infrastructure into existing public and private streets to create a comprehensive, integrated, connected transportation network for the City that balances access, mobility, health and safety needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, motorists, emergency responders, freight and users of all ages and abilities, ensuring a fully connected, integrated network that provides transportation options. “Complete streets infrastructure” means design features that contribute to a safe, convenient, or comfortable travel experience for users, including but not limited to features such as: sidewalks; shared use paths; bicycle lanes; automobile lanes; paved shoulders; street trees and landscaping; planting strips; curbs; accessible curb ramps; bulb outs; crosswalks; refuge islands; pedestrian and traffic signals, including countdown and accessible signals; signage; street furniture; bicycle parking facilities; public transportation stops and facilities; transit priority signalization; traffic calming devices such as rotary circles, traffic bumps, and surface treatments such as paving blocks, textured asphalt, and concrete; narrow vehicle lanes; raised medians; and dedicated transit lanes.

(Ord. 675 § 2, 2016; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).


13.20.210 Design. 

A. The design of streets shall depend upon their type and usage. Standard roadway sections for each street classification are provided at the end of this chapter.

1. Parking bays are required when parking is provided on one side of a street and may be required when parking is provided on both sides of a street. 

2. Parking lanes on arterials may be allowed with approval from the Director. Parking bays may be required on arterial streets.

3. Sidewalks in commercial areas shall be 10 feet wide when required by the Director.

4. Not required for two or less dwelling units.

5. A paved shoulder/bike lane shall be required if the neighborhood collector or local feeder street has been designated as a bike route.

6. A typical minimum curb return radius of 10 to 15 feet should be used where: 

• high pedestrian volumes are present or reasonably anticipated; 

• volumes of turning vehicles are low; 

• the width of the receiving intersection approach can accommodate a turning passenger vehicle without encroachment into the opposing lane; 

• passenger vehicles constitute the majority of turning vehicles; bicycle and parking lanes create additional space to accommodate the effective turning radius of vehicles; 

• low turning speeds are required or desired; and 

• occasional encroachment of a turning school bus, moving van, fire truck or oversized delivery truck into an opposing lane is acceptable. 

Curb radii will need to be larger than 15 feet where: 

• occasional encroachment of a turning school bus, moving van, fire truck or oversized delivery truck into an opposing lane is not acceptable; 

• curb extensions are proposed or might be added in the future; and 

• receiving street does not have parking or bicycle lanes and the receiving lane is less than 12 feet in width.

In such cases where a minimum curb return radius larger than 15 feet is proposed, it should be demonstrated that pedestrian safety will not be compromised beyond that which is necessary to accommodate other transportation facility requirements. 

7. This radius may be reduced with superelevation in conformance with AASHTO if approved by the Director. Maximum equals six percent.

8. May be reduced or eliminated if approved by the Director.

9. Pavement width and tract width shall increase eight feet for each parking lane desired.

10. Alley right-of-way, tract or width may vary depending on type of development being served and be reduced to the minimum dimension shown; provided, that at least 24 feet of separation will be maintained between garages with garage doors facing each other from opposite sides of the alley.

(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 565 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).


13.20.215 Functional classification.

A. General.

1. Functional Classification Elements. Streets are most effectively classified by their function, according to the character of the service they are intended to provide. The functional classification system creates a hierarchy of classified streets. The classification system can be used for planning new routes, improvements to existing streets, and planning for area development in concert with the transportation network and providing minimum design standards or criteria to encourage the use of the street as intended.

2. City definitions for each functional classification are presented below. The City functional classification system directly addresses all streets that are under the jurisdiction of the City. City streets are divided into major (or principal) arterials, secondary arterials, collector arterials, neighborhood collector arterials, and local access streets in accordance with regional transportation needs and the functional use each serves. Function is the controlling element for classification and shall govern rights-of-way, road width, and road geometrics. The function classification definitions in subsection (B) of this section are provided to assist the applicant in determining the classification of a particular street. New streets will be classified by the Director. If a street or portion of a street is not listed, the applicant is responsible for making inquiries to the Director to determine the correct street classification.

B. Function Classification Definitions.

1. Major Arterials.

a. Major arterials provide service for major traffic movements within the City. They serve major centers of activity, intra-area travel between University Place and other suburban centers, between larger communities, and between major trip generators. Major arterials serve the longest trips and carry the major portion of trips entering and leaving the overall area. Typically they are one of the highest traffic volume corridors in the City. The design year ADT is approximately 5,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day or more. They frequently carry important intra-urban and inter-city bus routes.

b. The spacing of major arterials usually varies from about one mile in highly developed business areas to five miles or more in rural areas. Service to abutting land is subordinate to the provision of routes for major traffic movements. It is desirable to place arterials on community and neighborhood boundaries or adjacent to, but not through, major shopping centers, parks, and other homogeneous areas.

2. Secondary Arterials.

a. Secondary arterials interconnect with and augment the major arterial system. Secondary arterials connect major arterials to collector arterials and small generators. They provide service to medium-size trip generators, such as less intensive commercial development, high schools and some junior high/grade schools, warehousing areas, active parks and ball fields, and other land uses with similar trip generation potential. They distribute travel to smaller geographic areas and communities than those identified with the major arterial system. They provide routes for trips of moderate length and somewhat lower level of travel mobility than major arterials. The design year ADT is approximately 2,500 to 15,000.

b. Spacing of secondary arterials is usually less than one mile in fully developed areas. They provide intra-community continuity and are typically a continuous street with a direct rather than a meandering alignment. They may carry local bus routes. Secondary arterials allow for more emphasis on land access than the major arterial system. They usually do not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods.

3. Collector Arterials. Collector arterials distribute trips from major and secondary arterials to the ultimate destination, or may collect traffic from local streets and channel it into the major and secondary arterial systems. They carry a low proportion of traffic traveling through the entire subarea; they carry a high proportion of local traffic with an origin or destination within that area. Design year ADT is approximately 2,500 to 15,000. They may be on a somewhat meandering alignment and need not be particularly long or continuous. Spacing is typically about one-quarter mile in developed areas. Collector arterials provide both land access service and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial, and industrial areas. They may penetrate identifiable residential neighborhoods.

4. Neighborhood Collector Arterials.

a. Neighborhood collector arterials distribute traffic between more principal traffic routes and local service streets within neighborhoods. All of them serve as fire response routes, some may be transit streets, and some may be designated as bike routes. Because neighborhood collector arterials serve multiple purposes, their use must strike a balance between efficiently moving traffic and preserving neighborhood livability.

b. Neighborhood collector arterials are found only in residential neighborhoods and provide a high degree of access to individual properties. This classification is not applied to streets in commercial and industrial areas. Both right-of-way and paving widths are typically narrower than on other arterials. Left-turn lanes are only infrequently used on neighborhood collector arterials, and then only at intersections having higher volumes. A great deal of flexibility exists for on-street parking on this street type. On most neighborhood collectors, bicycles share the travel lane with other motor vehicles, eliminating the need for striped bicycle lanes. Exceptions to this can occur in situations where traffic volumes or speeds, roadway geometry, or other factors suggest that striped lanes will provide a safer design. Design year ADT is approximately 800 to 3,000.

5. Local Street System.

a. The local street system provides circulation and access for residential neighborhoods away from the arterial system. The local street system consists of local feeder streets, neighborhood streets, access lanes, private streets, and alleys. Local streets should be designed for a relatively uniform, low volume of traffic upon full development. The system should be designed to discourage excessive vehicle speeds, maximize pedestrian connectivity and safety, and minimize the necessity for traffic control devices.

b. For developments or neighborhoods of moderate size or larger, the streets serving as primary access to and from the bordering arterial system should be considered for collector arterial classification. Traffic generators, such as schools or churches, within residential areas should be considered within the local circulation pattern, not only from within the subdivision, but from adjacent neighborhoods as well. There should be a limited number of access points with the arterial streets that border the subdivision.

c. Local feeder streets serve as primary access to the development from the adjacent street system. They distribute traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and channel it to the arterial system. There are usually no bus routes, with the possible exception of school bus routes. They directly serve any major traffic generators within the neighborhood, such as an elementary school or a church. They usually serve one moderate-size neighborhood or a combination of a few small developments, rather than interconnecting two or more larger neighborhoods. They serve little, if any, through traffic generated outside the neighborhood. Typical ADT may reach up to 1,500. 

d. Neighborhood streets provide direct access from abutting land to the local street system. There are usually no bus routes on neighborhood streets. They are typically internal subdivision streets providing circulation within the subdivision or between subdivisions. Service to through traffic is deliberately discouraged. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited on neighborhood streets in small lot developments and discouraged in other locations. Such cul-de-sacs must include a central green court consistent with the city’s low impact development goals and objectives.Typical ADT may reach up to 1,000.

e. Access lanes are designed to accommodate traffic between clusters of dwelling units, most commonly within small lot developments. They are the smallest street sections that serve emergency vehicles. Access lanes with a hammerhead, central green court or auto courtyard are allowed in lieu of cul-de-sacs, which are prohibited.

f. Private streets are streets privately owned and maintained by the owners of the parcels accessing the street.

g. Alleys are public or private streets providing access to the rear boundary of two or more residential properties that front a public street or a common open space area that fronts a public street. Alleys are not intended for general traffic circulation.

C. Functional classifications for arterial streets are provided in Table II, below.

13.20.220 Right-of-way. 

Right-of-way width is determined by the functional classification of a street. See Table I, Street Design Standards, in UPMC 13.20.210 for specific information. Additional roadside easements may be required to facilitate roadway maintenance. Easements shall be on a form approved by the City and meet the provisions of UPMC 13.10.030. Right-of-way width requirements shall be increased to accommodate any additional lanes, pockets, bus loading zones, paved shoulders/bike lanes, utilities, street trees or other features or facilities required by the City. Right-of-way shall be conveyed to the City on a recorded plat or by a right-of-way dedication deed. All costs shall be borne by the applicant.

(Ord. 565 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 518 § 1, 2008; Ord. 395 § 3, 2003).


13.20.225 Private streets.

A. The following are the standards for new private streets. Existing private streets that are not in conformance with any of the following are considered substandard streets.

1. Construction and inspection standards for public streets apply to private streets.

2. The design shall conform to Table I, Street Design Standards, in UPMC 13.20.210.

3. Private streets shall be permanently established by commonly owned tract or easement.

4. Groundcover shall be planted to achieve a minimum planting area coverage of 80 percent within three years of installation and shall achieve 100 percent coverage within five years of installation.

5. Fully composted organic material (compost) shall be installed around all trees, shrubs, and groundcover to a depth of three inches. The City may require installation of bark mulch as a top dressing over the compost.

D. Street Tree Requirements. Street trees are required on both sides of all newly created, widened, or substantially improved public and private streets to provide shade and to calm traffic, subject to the considerations provided in the Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements and the following requirements:

1. Trees shall have a minimum caliper of two inches within a development at time of planting unless the City determines that a particular species or cultivar, which is available only in a smaller size, is the preferred selection for a specific location;

2. Spacing of street trees, on average, shall be 30 feet on center. Wider spacing may be approved for trees having exceptionally broad canopies and narrower spacing may be required for trees having narrow canopy forms;

3. Street trees shall be high-branching with a canopy that starts at least six to eight feet above finished grade, depending on species or cultivar, and have roots that will not break up sidewalks or roadbeds or invade utility lines. For areas without overhead power lines, tree types shall be planted that will achieve a minimum height of 35 feet at maturity; 

4. Street trees shall be placed so as not to block sight distance or create a safety concern. Generally, trees should be planted at least 10 feet from utility or light poles or fire hydrants, 20 feet from street intersections, and 10 feet from driveways and alleys. The City may authorize irregular spacing to accommodate sight distance requirements for driveways or intersections or to avoid public infrastructure such as street lighting, utility poles or fire hydrants;

5. The use of a variety of street trees within a development is encouraged to increase visual interest and minimize exposure to diseases that could target specific species and cause widespread damage if these species are heavily planted within an area; 

6. For access lanes, street trees may be planted on the abutting private lot if the City determines that insufficient space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the trees;

7. Trees shall be centered in the planter strip or median; and

8. Root barriers shall be provided for all trees located within five feet of sidewalks, curbs or pavement and shall be a minimum of 24 inches in depth and 14 feet in length, installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations. The City may approve the use of engineered soil to accommodate tree roots in restricted planting areas.

E. Median Landscaping Requirements. Landscaping shall be subject to the following guidelines:

1. Where medians are narrowed near intersections, landscaping should be graduated and include the use of small accent trees and ground cover;

2. The use of groundcover or xeriscape concepts at intersections is favored over the extensive use of hardscape;

3. Hardscape should only be used in medians where planting is not feasible due to site-specific constraints such as narrow median width or preservation of a significant view corridor.

F. Planting Strip Landscaping Requirements. Landscaping shall be designed subject to the following guidelines:

1. Landscaping shall take into account visibility at intersections and a safe passage for pedestrian movement; 

2. To provide a landscape separation between street and sidewalk, planting strips should be installed between the back of the curb and the sidewalk;

3. Planting strips shall be designed to the extent practicable to be wide enough to accommodate medium to large street trees that have a high, broad-branching canopy; a continuous streetscape planting strip, exclusive of easements, shall be located in areas adjacent to an existing or proposed public road. The City shall decide on the width of the planting strip in order to balance median and sidewalk widths;

4. The planting strip shall be located generally parallel to the existing or proposed road and shall not be located in areas identified for road widening, road projects, drainage areas, or other public improvement projects. Minor encroachments in the planting strip by drainage easements may be approved by the City; 

5. Street trees shall be required to be planted within the planting strip with an even, linear spacing. If minor shifts to the linear spacing are required due to the location of existing infrastructure, development or required sight distance, these shifts may be approved by the City;

6. The use of groundcover or xeriscaping concepts adjacent to intersections is favored over the extensive use of hardscape; and

7. Hardscape should only be used in areas where planting is not feasible due to site-specific constraints such as a narrow median width or preservation of a significant view corridor.

G. Approved Right-of-Way Landscaping Species.

1. Street trees shall be approved by the City in accordance with the Approved Street Tree Palette in Table 3-1 of the Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements. The City may approve trees not on the Approved Street Tree Palette if a registered landscape architect or certified arborist demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the proposed tree species or cultivar will not cause damage to infrastructure or create nuisance conditions.

Article IX. Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements

Article IX-A. General Provisions


13.20.910 Introduction.

Streetscape design addresses elements that create pleasant, desirable street scenes that define a community’s character. The most easily identified streetscape features include street trees and other landscaping in sidewalk cut outs, planter strips (the narrow areas between the curb and sidewalk), right-of-way easements (the often wider areas between the back of sidewalks and private property lines), medians, City gateways and entries into the City from major streets. However, neighborhood places such as plazas, mini-parks along City streets, and trails where amenities such as “street furniture” (benches, trashcans, etc.) or public art are located are also a part of the City streetscape. Less obvious streetscape features include bus stops and their associated amenities such as shelters, benches and informational signs. Functional elements such as sound walls and planting associated with right-of-way walls or fences, as well as the irrigation systems and drainage systems used to maintain the streetscape areas, are all considered a part of the streetscape.

Streetscape improvements can have positive benefits to the natural environment. The reduction of paved areas with landscape treatments can increase groundwater recharge, as well as reduce the amounts of grease and oil transported to streams. They can help slow surface runoff from storms and reduce soil erosion and sedimentation of streams. Select tree species can help create habitat and food for birds and animals. Improvements may also be designed to create special conditions to protect threatened plants that would not otherwise exist in an urban setting. 

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 1)).


13.20.920 Organization.

The Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements document is organized into the following articles:

A. Article IX-B, Streetscape Design for Vehicular Zone.

B. Article IX-C, Streetscape Design for Pedestrian Zone.

The vehicular zone includes the area of the public right-of-way within the curb-to-curb cross-section of the street that is occupied by travel lanes, parking lanes, and any medians, traffic circles, etc., that occur between the curbs. The pedestrian zone includes the outer portions of the right-of-way that flank the street, including sidewalks and any adjoining plazas and parks. While the character and function of these two zones are closely connected, the guidelines in this chapter have been organized by zone to facilitate their use.

The standards and guidelines in this chapter apply to neighborhood collector streets and local streets associated with new development within the City as well as qualifying modifications to existing development. These streetscape concepts are intended to provide design professionals, property owners, residents, staff, and decision-makers with a clear and common understanding of the City’s expectations for the planning, design and review of development proposals in University Place. If a conflict exists between these standards and guidelines and any streetscape designs adopted pursuant to a specific area plan, the specific area plan standards and guidelines shall prevail. The standards and guidelines in this section are also intended to supplement the street design standards and specifications in this chapter. 

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 1)).


13.20.930 Definitions.

Bulb-outs: Bulb-outs extend the sidewalk or curb line out into the parking lane of a street to effectively reduce the street width. These measures greatly improve pedestrian crossings by reducing the crossing distance and improving the ability for pedestrians and motorists to see each other. Curb extensions also can help reduce turning speeds at an intersection and provide additional space for curb ramps and/or level sidewalk landings where space is limited. Bulb-outs are only appropriate where on-street parking exists; curb extensions should never reach into travel lanes, bicycle lanes, or shoulders.

Design guidelines: These minimum guidelines or recommendations are intended to guide the design of streets. Where conditions are not specifically addressed in the guidelines, it is the responsibility of the proponent to show that the proposed design solution meets the intent of the most closely related guidelines.

Median: The area of raised paving or planting running down the center of a street, separating the directions of traffic.

Multi-modal circulation: Refers to the circulation systems that involve multiple systems including: pedestrians, bicycles, automobiles, buses and other various forms of transportation found in University Place.

Multi-use paths: An off-road hard-surfaced path, that may be separated from motorized vehicular traffic by an open space or barrier, which has been designated, or designed and designated by the City for public use for human-powered travel or movement.

Paseos: Are private or public pathways that are designated for pedestrian use, and where appropriate can serve as an outdoor space for outdoor dining, public art, retail space and other activities deemed suitable by the City.

Pedestrian refuge: Pedestrian refuges are raised islands with minimum dimensions of four to six feet wide and eight to 12 feet long, which are placed in the center of the roadway separating opposing lanes of traffic. Pedestrian refuge islands are particularly suitable for wide two-way streets with four or more lanes of moving traffic traveling at higher speeds. They are particularly useful to persons with mobility disabilities, very old or very young pedestrians who walk at slower speeds, and persons who are in wheelchairs.

Pedestrian scale: The proportional relationship between an individual and his or her environment.

Right-of-way: The boundary of public ownership of the street. The area between private property lines is generally referred to as the public right-of-way.

Standards: Minimum/maximum requirements based on quantifiable criteria. 

Streetscape: The visual character of a street as determined by elements such as structures, access, greenery, open space, view, etc. The scene as may be observed along a public street composed of natural and manmade components, including buildings, paving, planting, street hardware, and miscellaneous structures.

Traffic calming: Refers to various design features and strategies intended to reduce vehicle traffic speeds and volumes on a particular roadway.

Xeriscape: A landscaping method that employs drought-resistant plants native to the region in an effort to conserve resources. 

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 4)).

Article IX-B. Streetscape Design for Vehicular Zone


13.20.940 Purpose.

A. Design Objective. To create a circulation system that provides for the safe and efficient movement of vehicles and reduces conflict with pedestrians and bicyclists and to provide roadway standards that will help create streets that are inviting, multi-modal public places for vehicular traffic, bicyclists, and pedestrians.

B. The streetscape types and standards are intended to implement desirable and safe neighborhoods and to provide the pedestrian with a sense of safety and accessibility in University Place. 

C. UPMC 13.20.950 describes the characteristics of streetscape types allowed in residential neighborhoods in University Place and UPMC 13.20.960 provides standards for the streetscape types.

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 2)).


13.20.950 Streetscape types.

The following streetscape types are specific to the applicable street types as defined below:

A. Neighborhood Collector Arterial. Neighborhood collector arterials are two-lane streets that distribute traffic between principal traffic routes and local service streets within neighborhoods. They are capable of a medium to high amount of vehicular traffic while still maintaining a high quality pedestrian environment.

Wherever a neighborhood collector arterial intersects with another street, the intersection should be designed to provide pedestrians with safe passage. Features may include pedestrian bulb-outs, differentiated accent paving or striped paint within the intersection, and pedestrian refuge areas within the medians of arterials.

This streetscape type can be adapted to accommodate bus stops in accordance with City requirements and the specifications of Pierce Transit. 

1. Neighborhood collector arterial streets should be paved, with a six-inch vertical cement concrete curb and gutter, a five-and-one-half-foot to eight-foot planted buffer strip, and five-foot cement concrete sidewalk on both sides of the street. 

2. The pavement section width may vary depending on whether bicycle lanes or parallel parking are included.

3. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited.

4. The road right-of-way should be a minimum of 60 feet in width. The City may require additional right-of-way width within the pavement section, the buffer strip or beyond the sidewalk when determined necessary by the City Engineer to accommodate parking, traffic signage, larger street trees or other facilities intended to serve the public.

5. A neighborhood collector arterial street shall be a public road.

B. Local Feeder Street. Local feeder streets serve as primary access to residential developments from the adjacent street system. They distribute traffic from neighborhood streets and access lanes and channel it to the arterial system. These streets promote multi-modal transportation and create a leisurely pedestrian environment within new and existing neighborhoods in University Place. 

Landscape strips and parallel parking provide buffers between the pedestrian environment and vehicular traffic. Local feeder streets are intended to have a more intimate nature than higher level arterial and collector streets in the City. Wherever a local feeder street intersects with another street the intersection should be designed to provide pedestrians with a safe passage. Features may include pedestrian bulb-outs and striped or differentiated accent paving within the intersection.

1. Local feeder streets should be paved, 34 feet wide from inside of curb to inside of curb, with a six-inch vertical cement concrete curb and gutter, an eight-foot planted buffer strip, and five-foot cement concrete sidewalk on both sides of the street. 

2. Seven-foot-wide, parallel parking shall be included on both sides of the street.

3. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited.

4. The road right-of-way should be 60 feet in width. The City may require additional right-of-way width within either the buffer strip or beyond the sidewalk when determined necessary by the City Engineer to accommodate traffic signage, larger street trees or other facilities intended to serve the public.

5. A local feeder street shall be a public road.

C. Neighborhood Street. Neighborhood streets are typically internal subdivision streets providing circulation within the subdivision or between subdivisions. Travel lanes and the overall road section are narrower than the typical local road, contributing to the residential character of the streetscape. 

1. Neighborhood streets should be paved, 27 feet wide from inside of curb to inside of curb, with a six-inch vertical cement concrete curb and gutter, an eight-foot planted buffer strip, and five-foot cement concrete sidewalk on both sides of the street. 

2. Seven-foot-wide, parallel parking shall be included on one side of the street.

3. Neighborhood streets should not exceed 150 feet in length without an emergency vehicle turn-around or through connection to another road. All portions of the exterior of the first floor of the dwelling units shall not exceed 150 feet from emergency vehicle access.

4. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited on neighborhood streets in small lot developments and discouraged in other locations. A cul-de-sac may be approved in a conventional plat when connectivity with the surrounding neighborhood is achieved. Such cul-de-sacs must include a central green court consistent with the City’s low impact development goals and objectives. 

5. The road right-of-way should be 53 feet in width. The City may require additional right-of-way width within either the buffer strip or beyond the sidewalk when determined necessary by the City Engineer to accommodate traffic signage, larger street trees or other facilities intended to serve the public.

6. A neighborhood street shall be a public road.

Figure 13.20.950-4

[IMAGE]


D. Access Lane. Access lanes are designed to accommodate traffic between clusters of dwelling units, most commonly within small lot developments. They are the smallest street sections that serve emergency vehicles. Access lanes with a central green court and auto courtyards are allowed in lieu of cul-de-sacs, which are prohibited.

1. The access lane should be paved, 20 feet wide, with six-inch vertical cement concrete curbs and gutter, and shall not be longer than 150 feet without an emergency vehicle turn-around or through connection to another road.

2. All portions of the exterior of the first floor of the dwelling units shall not exceed 150 feet from emergency vehicle access.

3. The road right-of-way should be a minimum of 40 feet in width. A sidewalk or path may be placed within the 10 feet of right-of-way on either side of the paved roadway.

4. An access lane should be a public road.

5. Parallel parking should not be permitted within an access lane’s constructed roadway. The right-of-way may accommodate perpendicular parking associated with private driveways.

6. An access lane should only intersect with another access lane, neighborhood street or alleyway.

7. At the City’s discretion, pedestrian walkways may be constructed with pervious pavement in order to achieve low impact development goals and objectives.

Figure 13.20.950-5

E. Alleys.

1. Alleys are desirable facilities that eliminate the impact of the garage door and driveway apron on the streetscape and eliminate driveway access conflicts on streets with higher traffic volumes or speeds. They enhance the pedestrian orientation of the streetscape, reduce clutter associated with utility facilities and refuse collection, and provide additional flexibility for emergency response providers.

2. The purpose is to promote alleys at appropriate locations, with design quality consistent with existing neighborhood streetscapes and to improve the connectivity of future development in University Place.


[IMAGE]


Figure 13.20.950-6

Desirable: Front yard without garage or parking apron. Alleys are desirable to eliminate the impact of the garage door and driveway on the streetscape and eliminate access conflict to the street.

3. Alley Design Principles.

a. Alleys may have a straight layout and an unobstructed view from one end to the other when the goal is to provide the easiest access for utilities and services and the most open invitation to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 

b. Alley alignments may be adjusted to create more visual privacy through the use of jogs in the travel lane, doglegs or neck-downs at entrances, and building placement; provided, that utility designs and emergency or service vehicle access are not rendered impractical.

c. Dead-end alleys should not be used except when there are no practical alternatives due to topography or other site constraints.

d. When dead-end alleys are used, they should be less than 150 feet in length.

e. An alley should be a private road. Emergency response vehicles must have access through alleys.

f. Each lot shall provide lighting from either an attached building light fixture or a pedestal lighting fixture that is directed downward or employs control features to avoid spillover into adjacent rear yards and homes.

g. Parking shall not be permitted on either side of the alleyway.

h. Where an alleyway intersects an adjacent right-of-way, the alleyway shall be designed as a residential driveway with continuous curb, gutter, and sidewalk along the neighborhood street or access lane.

i. Pervious pavement is encouraged, and may be required, in order to achieve the City’s low impact development goals and objectives.

Figure 13.20.950-7

F. Paseos. Paseos are pedestrian pathways that add a dimension and improve the pedestrian circulation network. Paseos may also provide limited service access during specified periods of the day and to emergency service vehicles. In addition portions of the Paseo may be used for outdoor dining, retail space, patios, art gardens, and related uses. Paseos should have a minimum unobstructed horizontal pedestrian clearance of 12 feet. The total width of the paseo should take into account intended uses and furnishings (such as tables, benches, planter pots, etc.) and provide for 12 feet clear in addition to the space required for the desired uses and furnishings. If a paseo provides more than one pedestrian passageway (such as tables in the middle and pedestrian passage on each side), then one pedestrian passage shall be at least 12 feet clear, and any additional passageways must be a minimum of 10 feet clear.

These types of “streets” are not shown in current land use designations, but would be appropriate to connect uses and activities in a pedestrian orientation without additional public rights-of-way. Paseos can also be incorporated into development areas where unique site constraints or opportunities are present, such as connecting front (street) and rear (alley) activity areas of the commercial block. Paseo street lighting and landscaping should be designed at a pedestrian scale.

G. Multi-Use Paths. Multi-use paths provide low-stress environments for bicycling and walking that are separate from motor vehicle traffic. They can be great places for novice and child bicyclists to try out their bicycling skills prior to taking trips on urban streets. Multi-use paths are frequently in high demand among bicyclists, joggers, in-line skaters, people walking dogs, people with disabilities, and a variety of other users. Systems of multi-use paths in urban and suburban neighborhoods serve as the arterials of the bicycle and pedestrian transportation system. They serve as a complement to and extension of on-street facilities and offer the protection from motor vehicle traffic that many citizens seek when looking to leave their vehicle behind in favor of walking, or using a bike or a skateboard, or other form of non-motorized transportation.

1. Accessible Path Design. Because multi-use paths provide a transportation function, all newly constructed shared-use paths should be built to provide access for people with disabilities. In addition, existing shared-use paths should be improved to enhance access whenever possible. Key issues for accessibility include trail access points, grade, cross-slope, street crossings, curb ramp design, railings, and signage. A single source of access guidance for shared-use trails has not been compiled; however, taken together, the sources above address the essential topics.

a. Surfaces can be paved (asphalt or concrete) or unpaved (crushed stone or aggregate), but should be firm, stable, and slip-resistant.

b. Grades should generally be less than five percent, but can be up to eight percent for short distances, such as 10 feet. Level landings or rest areas should be provided at appropriate intervals on grades steeper than five percent.

c. Cross-slopes for drainage or super elevated curves should be no greater than two percent.

2. Trail Width. Under some conditions, the City may require a dedicated bicycle path and pedestrian path to be separated by a landscaping strip. In such cases, signage shall be provided to illustrate the dedicated bicycle and pedestrian lanes. Where space may be limited or bike and pedestrian traffic is moderate, however, a shared pathway may be acceptable. The recommended paved width for shared two-directional trails is 10 feet; however 12 to 14 feet widths are preferred where heavy traffic is expected.

13.20.970 Intersection improvements.

One of the objectives of the streetscape guidelines is to create a pedestrian friendly environment. The following guidelines for the treatment of the intersection will help to integrate the future built form, create a functional and aesthetic neighborhood pedestrian corridor and provide a safe environment.

A. Pedestrian crossings should be striped with a painted crosswalk to provide high visibility for both motorists and pedestrians.

B. Curb extensions or bulb-outs should be provided at the four corners of the intersection as a means of reducing pedestrian travel distance across the intersection, providing additional sidewalk space, providing additional opportunities for streetscape treatments and to slow traffic.

C. Street trees and raised planters should be considered where they will not interfere with pedestrian movement or obstruct sightlines for both motorists and pedestrians. 

D. Pedestrian crossings should be integrally designed with the rest of the intersection.

Article IX-C. Streetscape Design for Pedestrian Zone


13.20.980 Introduction.

A. Design Objective: To provide a higher level of design detail and to promote walkability by improving pedestrian safety, convenience, and comfort. The guidelines focus on improving the attractiveness and effectiveness of the pedestrian network in order to encourage walking as a realistic mode of transportation. They provide design strategies for enhancing the physical safety, comfort, and convenience of the pedestrian environment as well as the aesthetic character and quality of the pedestrian experience.

B. This pedestrian zone article covers the following subcategories:

1. Sidewalks;

2. Curb return radii;

3. Street widths;

4. Street furniture;

5. Bus shelters;

6. Utilities;

7. Medians;

8. Planting strips.

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3)).


13.20.990 Sidewalks.

A. The sidewalk is the unifying element that knits University Place together, from the City’s core areas to the adjacent residential neighborhoods that surround it. Providing pedestrian linkages is vital to achieving character and a sense of community. Nicely designed sidewalks that are inviting are principal factors in creating and increasing pedestrian activity. Sidewalks can also aid in decreasing the amount of traffic throughout University Place and providing safe routes for multiple users. Sidewalks can be designed to create a sense of community and social engagement.

B. Guidelines.

1. Dedicate adequate space within the public street right-of-way to support a safe, comfortable, attractive, and robust pedestrian environment.

2. Public sidewalks should provide a direct and continuous pedestrian network that connects neighborhoods to each other with a clear, unobstructed pedestrian pathway that is designed to accommodate the needs of a broad range of users, including the elderly, those with disabilities, and young children.

3. Landscaping of the public sidewalk is encouraged as a means of adding color and visual interest, softening the urban edges, providing shade, and improving air quality. Landscaping generally should be located in the amenity and frontage zones and should not obstruct through pedestrian traffic or access to the street.

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3.1)).


13.20.1000 Curb return radii.

A. Curb returns are the curved connection of curbs formed by the intersection of two streets. A curb return’s purpose is to guide vehicles in turning corners and separate vehicular traffic from pedestrian areas at intersection corners. The radius of the curve varies with longer radii used to facilitate the turning of large trucks and buses. Larger radius corners increase the length of pedestrian crosswalks. Special care must be taken in specifying curb return radii so that transportation facilities will be designed to be safe for all users regardless of the mode of travel they chose. 

B. Generally, intersections should be designed as compact as practical. This is especially true for small lot developments, which are intended to be pedestrian-oriented in all facets of design while still accommodating the automobile. To help achieve this goal, the smallest practical curb return radii are used to shorten the length of the pedestrian crossing distance, crossing time, exposure to traffic, encourage pedestrian travel and increase safety.

C. According to Context Sensitive Solutions in Designing Major Urban Thoroughfares for Walkable Communities, issued as a Proposed Recommended Practice by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in 2006, a typical minimum curb return radius of 10 to 15 feet should be used where:

1. High pedestrian volumes are present or reasonably anticipated;

2. Volumes of turning vehicles are low;

3. The width of the receiving intersection approach can accommodate a turning passenger vehicle without encroachment into the opposing lane;

4. Passenger vehicles constitute the majority of turning vehicles;

5. Bicycles and parking lanes create additional space to accommodate the “effective” turning radius of vehicles;

6. Low turning speeds are required or desired; and 

7. Occasional encroachment of a turning school bus, moving van, fire truck or oversized delivery truck into an opposing lane is acceptable.

D. Per the ITE recommendations, curb radii will need to be larger than 15 feet where:

1. Occasional encroachment of a turning school bus, moving van, fire truck or oversized delivery truck into an opposing lane is not acceptable;

2. Curb extensions are proposed or might be added in the future; and

3. Receiving street does not have parking or bicycle lanes and the receiving lane is less than 12 feet in width.

E. In such cases where a minimum curb return radius larger than 15 feet is proposed, it should be demonstrated that pedestrian safety will not be compromised beyond that which is necessary to accommodate other transportation facility requirements. 

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3.1)).


13.20.1010 Street widths.

A. Pavement widths on many existing streets adversely affect the visual and neighborhood design character of the area being served. Wide streets are generally at odds with preserving the pedestrian scale and intimate character that contribute to successful residential neighborhoods. 

B. Guidelines.

1. Design elements are encouraged to be used to reduce perceived street widths. These elements can include landscaping, street tree placement, medians and street furniture.

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3.2)).


13.20.1020 Street furniture.

A. In order to transform the public streetscape from mere transportation facility to vibrant public open space it is important to add facilities and amenities that: allow people to stop and linger, provide services and information, and engage and delight the senses. 

B. Providing comfort and convenience for pedestrians is vital to creating vibrant and walkable neighborhoods. The placement and selection of street furniture are keys to ensuring a comfortable environment for pedestrian and visual unity for all areas of University Place. Street furnishings should be chosen in a manner to adapt to the context of the streetscape. 

C. Guidelines.

1. Street furniture shall be consistent with established City standards and requirements. It should contribute to the character of development and should not impact adjacent development.

2. Street furniture should be clustered to provide amenity nodes for pedestrians; however placement shall not obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic. These clusters shall be provided adjacent to neighborhood streets where they may intersect pocket parks, trails, paseos or other off-street amenities.

3. Adequate space should be allocated to accommodate the various types of street furniture and anticipated volumes of users.

4. Graffiti-proof surfaces should be used where feasible.

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3.3)).


13.20.1030 Bus shelters.

A. Bus shelters shall be in keeping with the street furniture palette and shall be approved by the providing local transit agency. 

B. Guidelines.

1. Bus shelters should be provided at appropriate locations to facilitate transit use by providing places of refuge, especially during periods of rain.

2. Shelter design should also be compatible with the architectural design of the surrounding neighborhood.

3. Transit shelters should be designed to provide protection from sun, wind, and rain; additional amenities, such as real-time arrival information, nighttime lighting, and trash receptacles, should be provided.

4. Transit shelters should be designed to promote transit and energy efficiency by incorporating features such as solar panels, LED lights, etc.

5. Graffiti-proof surfaces should be used where feasible. 

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3.4)).


13.20.1040 Utilities.

A. Above ground utilities are a common element found within the context of the streetscape. These utilities include power poles and lines, transformers, telecommunication pedestals, traffic signal control panels, etc. Often these utilities are located with little or no regard for the overall aesthetic appearance of the street. While access and maintenance issues are important and not to be overlooked, special design considerations must be taken into account in order to minimize their cumulative negative visual impact on the street.

B. Guidelines.

1. Whenever possible, utilities should be located underground. Where this is not possible utilities shall be located to the side or back of a building where they will be out of view from the street.

2. Utilities shall be screened from view through the use of planting, fencing or architectural screening. The design of the screen or fence should be complementary to the building material and existing fences or screens if located elsewhere on the property.

	Figure 13.20.1040-1

Left: Utility box enhanced with landscaping. Above: Utility box hidden by landscaping.

 

3. Ensure that maintenance personnel can access the utility without obstructing the movement of pedestrians or vehicles to other parts of the street or site.

4. The City should explore a combination of options to address the visibility and attractiveness of utility boxes.

5. Landscaping shall not block, impede or hide fire hydrants or fire sprinkler hose connections. Fire hydrants may be aesthetically enhanced provided their accessibility and use is not impeded or compromised. 

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3.5)).


13.20.1050 Medians.

A. Medians provide many functions for a streetscape. Properly landscaped medians can help to beautify roadways of the City while providing pedestrians a safe refuge during street crossings. Special considerations must be taken when designing and landscaping medians to take into account pedestrian crossings and intersection visibility. Landscape planting shall also take into account the widths and placement of trees to accommodate safe traffic flow on these corridors.

B. Guidelines.

1. Landscaped medians should be implemented on arterial streets consistent with this title to create visual interest, a more intimate roadway scale, and a place for pedestrians to take refuge while crossing wide streets.

2. Where medians are narrowed near intersections, landscaping should be graduated and include the use of small accent trees and groundcover.

3. The use of groundcover or xeriscape concepts at intersections is favored over the extensive use of hardscape.

4. Hardscape should only be used in medians where planting is not feasible due to site-specific constraints such as narrow median width or preservation of a significant view corridor.

5. All landscaping requiring irrigation should be served by an automatic irrigation system, consistent with City Standard Details and Specifications in this title. 

(Ord. 559 § 7 (Exh. B § 3.6)).


13.20.1060 Streetscape landscaping.

A. Street trees and other landscaping treatments are essential for creating beauty and improving the quality of life in a neighborhood setting. The benefits include: providing shade and cooling effects, providing a sense of enclosure, providing definition and scale to the street, protection from wind, separation from vehicular traffic, and reducing airborne dust and pollutants. 

B. Many opportunities exist for street tree planting and other landscaping treatments in the existing neighborhoods of University Place. The most favorable locations are within sidewalks and planting strips to enhance the streetscape environment and within traffic medians to reinforce traffic calming measures.

C. Guidelines. Existing trees within the public right-of-way should be examined for growth characteristics, the health of the tree and suitability of the location. Every effort should be made to protect mature and suitable trees. Considerations for the selection and location of street trees include:

1. The ultimate growth, height and spread of the tree canopy in order to allow for unrestricted growth;

2. The density of the canopy, ultimate shape and branching pattern. Trees will provide varying degrees of shade due to branching habits and size and type of leaf;

3. Access to adequate sunlight and rain water. Considerations of other microclimatic limitations such as reflected light sources from surface pavements and buildings and increased wind load caused by building design should be considered when locating trees either on the street or as part of a site plan development;

4. The location of existing and proposed utilities to allow uninhibited growth without disturbance to the tree crown or root zone;

5. Maintenance requirements of street trees including watering, fertilizing, pruning and repair of damage caused naturally and unnaturally; and

6. Height of the tree canopy to protect sightlines along the street for both motorists and pedestrians.

D. Standards and Guidelines.

1. Planting Strips. Planting strips aid in separating the pedestrian environment from the vehicular environment via street trees and other native plants and flowers. In addition, planting strips also aid in providing shade for pedestrians, help to filter air from adjacent roadways, and can facilitate a social streetscape environment. Landscaping of planting strips shall always take into account visibility at intersections and a safe passage for pedestrian movement.

a. Guidelines.

(1) Landscaping in planting strips shall be adequately maintained and include the installation of an automatic irrigation system consistent with City Standard Details and Specifications in this title.

(2) To provide a landscape separation between street and sidewalk, planting strips should be installed between the back of the curb and the sidewalk.

(3) Planting strips shall be designed to the extent practicable to be wide enough to accommodate medium to large street trees that have a high, broad branching canopy; a continuous streetscape planting strip, exclusive of easements, shall be located in areas adjacent to an existing or proposed public road. The City shall decide on the width of the planting strip in order to balance median and sidewalk widths. 

(4) The planting strip shall be located generally parallel to the existing or proposed road and shall not be located in areas identified for road widening, road projects, drainage areas, or other public improvement projects. Minor encroachments in the planting strip by drainage easements may be approved by the City. 

(5) Street trees shall be required to be planted within the planting strip with an even, linear spacing. If minor shifts to the linear spacing are required due to the location of existing infrastructure, development or required sight distance, these shifts may be approved by the City.

(6) The use of groundcover or xeriscaping concepts adjacent to intersections is favored over the extensive use of hardscape.

(7) Hardscape should only be used in areas where planting is not feasible due to site-specific constraints such as a narrow median width or preservation of a significant view corridor.

2. Street Trees. Street trees are required on both sides of all newly created, widened, or substantially improved public and private streets to provide shade and to calm traffic. 

a. Guidelines.

(1) Trees shall have a minimum caliper of two inches within a development at time of planting unless the City determines that a particular species or cultivar, which is available only in a smaller size, is the preferred selection for a specific location.

(2) Spacing of street trees, on average, shall be 30 feet on center. Wider spacing may be approved for trees having exceptionally broad canopies and narrower spacing may be required for trees having narrow canopy forms.

(3) Street trees shall be high-branching with a canopy that starts at least six to eight feet above finished grade, depending on species or cultivar, and have roots that will not break up sidewalks or roadbeds or invade utility lines. For areas without overhead power lines, tree types shall be planted that will achieve a minimum height of 35 feet at maturity. 

(4) Street trees shall be placed so as not to block sight distance or create a safety concern. Generally, trees should be planted at least 10 feet from utility or light poles or fire hydrants, 20 feet from street intersections, and 10 feet from driveways and alleys. The City may authorize irregular spacing to accommodate sight distance requirements for driveways or intersections or to avoid public infrastructure such as street lighting, utility poles or fire hydrants.

(5) Street tree species shall be approved by the City in accordance with the Approved Street Tree Palette in Table 13.20.1060. The use of a variety of street trees within a development is encouraged to increase visual interest and minimize exposure to diseases that could target specific species and cause widespread damage if these species are heavily planted within an area. The City may approve trees not on the Approved Street Tree Palette if a registered landscape architect or certified arborist demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the proposed tree species or cultivar will not cause damage to infrastructure or create nuisance conditions.

(6) For access lanes, street trees may be planted on the abutting private lot if the City determines that insufficient space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the trees.

3. Approved Street Tree Palette. The street tree palette for street tree selection includes trees selected for their survivability, drought tolerance, native habitat, ease of maintenance, and appearance. The following table is arranged by planting strip width; selections should consider planting strip width and other site characteristics. 

	DT – Drought tolerant

	WWN – Western Washington native

	HF – Hard to find

	 

	T – May need training, multi-stemmed

	WCN – West Coast native

	Highlighted – Utility Friendly

M. “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

N. “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

O. “Flood fringe” means the area subject to inundation by the base flood, but outside the limits of the floodway, and which may provide needed temporary capacity for flood waters.

P. “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

Q. “Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

R. “Floodplain” means the total area subject to inundation by the base flood including the flood fringe and the floodway areas.

S. “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

T. “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of UPMC 14.15.040(E)(2)(b).

U. “Manufactured home” means a factory-assembled structure intended solely for human habitation, which has sleeping, eating and plumbing facilities, that is being used for residential purposes, that was constructed in accordance with the HUD Federal Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act in effect at the time of construction, and that is constructed in a way suitable for movement along public highways.

V. “Mobile home/manufactured home park” means a tract of land designed and maintained under a single ownership of unified control where two or more spaces or pads are provided solely for the placement of mobile or manufactured homes for residential purposes with or without charge.

W. “New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

X. “Recreational vehicle” means a structure or vehicle, other than a mobile home, which is permanently designed and intended for use for temporary housing purposes. Recreational vehicles shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, campers, motor homes, and travel trailers.

Y. “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation of the property or accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

Z. “Structure” means anything that is constructed in or on the ground or over water, including any edifice, gas or liquid storage tank, and any piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts and joined together. For the purposes of this regulation, structure does not include paved areas, fill, or any vehicle.

AA. “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

BB. “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

1. Before the improvement or repair is started; or

2. If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

CC. “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

DD. “Water dependent” means any use which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations.

(Ord. 680 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 164 § 1, 1997).


14.15.020 General provisions.

A. Lands to Which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the City of University Place, Washington.

B. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Pierce County,” dated March 7, 2017, as amended, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), as amended, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study and the FIRM are on file at City Hall.

C. Penalties for Noncompliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of University Place from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

D. Severability. If any section, clause, sentence, or phase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.

E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

F. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

1. Considered as minimum requirements;

2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.

G. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of University Place, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(Ord. 680 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 164 § 2, 1997).


14.15.030 Administration.

A. Site Development Permit.

1. Site Development Permit Required. A site development permit and building permit if applicable shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in UPMC 14.15.020(B). The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes, and for all development including fill and other activities.

2. Application for Site Development Permit. Application for a site development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Community Development Department, and in addition to the minimum requirements in the public work standards, may include but not be limited to plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

a. Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;

b. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed;

c. Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in UPMC 14.15.040(B)(2); and

d. Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

B. Designation of the Local Administrator. The Community Development Department is hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying site development permit applications through the City permit center in accordance with its provisions.

C. Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Administrator. Duties of the Community Development Department shall include, but not be limited to:

1. Permit Review.

a. Review all site development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.

b. Review all site development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.

c. Review all site development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of UPMC 14.15.040(C)(1) are met.

2. Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with UPMC 14.15.020(B), the Department shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer UPMC 14.15.040(B) and (C).

3. Information to Be Obtained and Maintained.

a. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study or required as in subsection (C)(2) of this section, obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.

b. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:

(1) Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level); and

(2) Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in subsection (A)(2)(c) of this section.

c. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

4. Alteration of Watercourses.

a. Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.

b. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.

5. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations, where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in UPMC Title 22.

D. Variances.

1. The Hearings Examiner may grant a variance to the requirements of this chapter. Before granting a variance the Hearings Examiner shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

e. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

f. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

g. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

h. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

2. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (D)(1) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the Hearings Examiner may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. The decision of the Hearings Examiner shall include the written warning provided for in subsection (D)(4)(h) of this section should a variance be granted.

3. The City Clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal actions. The Community Development Department shall report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.

4. Conditions for Variances.

a. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be granted is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in subsections (D)(1)(a) through (k) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

b. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

c. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

d. Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

e. Variances shall only be issued upon:

(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection (D)(1) of this section, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

f. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

g. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (D)(4)(a) of this section, and otherwise complies with UPMC 14.15.040(A) and (B).

h. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

5. Variance Procedure. Variances shall be processed in accordance with UPMC Title 22.

(Ord. 680 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 423 §§ 43 – 46, 2004; Ord. 164 § 3, 1997).


14.15.040 Provisions for flood hazard reduction.

A. General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:

1. Anchoring.

a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.

b. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).

2. Construction Materials and Methods.

a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

b. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

c. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

3. Utilities.

a. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;

b. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and

c. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

4. Subdivision Proposals.

a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;

c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and

d. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least five lots.

5. Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source (UPMC 14.15.030(C)(2)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.

B. Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in UPMC 14.15.020(B) or 14.15.030(C)(2), the following provisions are required:

1. Residential Construction.

a. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation.

b. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(1) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

(2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

(3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

2. Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

a. Be floodproofed so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in UPMC 14.15.030(C)(3)(b);

d. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (B)(1)(b) of this section;

e. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below).

3. Manufactured Homes.

a. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1 – 30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites:

(1) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,

(2) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,

(3) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or

(4) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood;

shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.

b. Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1 – 30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured home provisions be elevated so that either:

(1) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation; or

(2) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

4. Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1 – 30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM either:

a. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

c. Meet the requirements of subsection (B)(3) of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.

C. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in UPMC 14.15.020(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

2. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for (a) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and (b) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either (a) before the repair, or reconstruction is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places shall not be included in the 50 percent.

3. If subsection (C)(1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

D. AE and A1 – 30 Zones with Base Flood Elevations but No Floodways. In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1 – 30 and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point in the City.

E. Standards for Shallow Flooding Areas (AO Zones). Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

1. New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

2. New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:

a. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

b. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as in subsection (B)(2)(c) of this section.

3. Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

4. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO zones on the community’s FIRM either:

a. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or

c. Meet the requirements of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.

F. Coastal High Hazard Areas. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in UPMC 14.15.020(B) are coastal high hazard areas, designated as zones V1 – 30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:

1. All new construction and substantial improvements in zones V1 – 30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:

a. The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level; and

b. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

2. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (F)(1)(a) and (b) of this section.

3. Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in zones V1 – 30 and VE, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The community services department shall maintain a record of all such information.

4. All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.

5. Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:

a. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

b. The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

6. If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.

7. Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings.

8. Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage.

9. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones V1 – 30, V, and VE on the community’s FIRM on sites:

a. Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;

b. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

c. In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

d. In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood; meet the standards of subsections (F)(1) through (9) of this section and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones V1 – 30, V, and VE on the FIRM meet the requirements of subsection (B)(3) of this section.

10. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones V1 – 30, V, and VE on the community’s FIRM either:

a. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or

c. Meet the requirements of UPMC 14.15.030(A)(1) (permitting requirements) and subsections (F)(1) through (9) of this section.

G. Critical Facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation (100-year) at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

17.15.005 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect, preserve and enhance areas that are sensitive to human activities, including steep slopes, and landslide and erosion hazard areas. Additionally, the purpose of this chapter is to regulate development in geologically hazardous areas and associated buffers to avoid unstable slopes and adverse impacts to such areas and adjacent upslope and downslope areas.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.15.010 Erosion hazard areas criteria.

Erosion hazard areas are identified by the presence of vegetative cover, soil texture, slope, and rainfall patterns, or human-induced changes to such characteristics, which create site conditions vulnerable to erosion. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.15.015 Landslide hazard areas criteria.

Landslide hazard areas are those areas meeting any of the following criteria:

A. Areas of historic failures, including areas of old and recent landslides;

B. Areas with both of the following characteristics:

1. Slopes steeper than 15 percent; and

2. Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock.

C. Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness, such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes, in subsurface materials;

D. Slopes having a gradient steeper than 80 percent subject to rock fall during seismic shaking;

E. Areas potentially unstable as a result of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action;

F. Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding;

G. Any area with a slope of 30 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet. A slope is delineated by establishing the toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least 10 feet of vertical relief;

H. Areas that have a “severe” limitation for building site development because of slope conditions, according to the National Resource Conservation Service.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.15.020 Mapping.

Mapping. Landslide and erosion hazard areas meeting the criteria established above are delineated on hazard maps created by the Department. The actual presence or absence of landslide or erosion hazard areas shall be determined by field conditions and the classification criteria listed above.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.15.025 Restrictions on building.

Restrictions on Building. In areas meeting both of the following characteristics no structure or disturbance of vegetation is permitted:

If any changed environmental conditions are associated with the site, or surrounding the site, the applicant shall submit an amendment to the geotechnical report.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.15.055 Regulation.

A. Department Approval. The development proposal may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied based on the Department’s evaluation of the geotechnical report, including, but not limited to:

1. The ability of the proposed mitigation or engineering measures to reduce risks to the proposed structure and risks to the erosion or landslide hazard area; and adjacent property; and

2. The proposed development’s conformance with the following performance standards:

a. Location and Extent of Development.

(1) Development shall be located to minimize disturbance and removal of vegetation; and

(2) Structures shall be clustered where possible to reduce disturbance and maintain natural topographic character; and

(3) Structures shall conform to the natural contours of the slope and foundations should be tiered where possible to conform to existing topography of the site.

b. Design of Development.

(1) All development proposals shall be designed to minimize the building footprint and other disturbed areas; and

(2) All development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage; and

(3) Roads, walkways and parking areas shall be designed to parallel the natural contours; and

(4) Access shall be in the least sensitive area of the site, as feasible.

B. Buffer Requirement. A buffer, consisting of undisturbed natural vegetation and measured (as shown in Figure 15-1) in a perpendicular direction from all landslide and erosion hazard areas, shall be required. The buffer shall be required from the top of slope and toe of slope of all landslide or erosion hazard areas that measure 10 feet or more in vertical elevation change from top to toe of slope. The minimum buffer distance requirements from the top of slope and toe of slope of landslide or erosion hazard areas shall be the same as for setbacks from slopes as identified in the International Building Code, as amended from time to time. Regulated uses/activities that occur outside the buffer required by this subsection, the setback required by subsection (C) of this section, and any potential landslide run-out do not require a geotechnical report. The other provisions of this chapter shall apply.

C. Building Setback and Construction Adjacent to Buffer. Eight-foot minimum setback lines (as shown in Figure 15-2) shall be required from the buffer area required in this section for construction of any impervious surface(s) greater than 120 square feet of base coverage. Clearing, grading, and filling within the eight-foot setback shall only be allowed when the applicant can demonstrate that vegetation within the buffer will not be damaged. The setback is required in addition to the buffer regardless of buffer width, except as provided in subsection (D) of this section. 

D. Modifications and Flexibility. Alteration of a geologically hazardous area or an associated buffer or buffer setback may occur where:

1. A geotechnical report has been submitted showing, to the satisfaction of the City, that the proposal will have no adverse impact on the stability or erosion susceptibility of the adjacent hazardous slope area. A modified slope, a reduced or eliminated buffer, and/or a reduced or eliminated setback shall not be permitted unless the proposed design, engineering and mitigation measures pertaining to any modifications within a landslide or erosion hazard area adequately reduce risk to proposed structures, to or from landslide and erosion hazard areas, and to adjacent areas. Should the geotechnical report indicate that a greater buffer than that required by this section is needed to meet the intent of this chapter, the greater buffer shall be required;

2. The impacted area of disturbance totals no more than 20 percent of the project site;

3. The modification will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions;

4. The activity will not adversely impact other critical areas as regulated in this title or shorelands as regulated in UPMC Title 18;

5. The development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent properties;

6. Stormwater runoff from any new impervious surface is managed and accommodated through LID design to the extent practicable. Where LID design will not fully manage and accommodate this stormwater, at the discretion of the City it shall be directed to the City’s storm drainage system or collected in a detention system and directed to an enclosed drainage system; and

7. For slopes of 40 percent or greater, the following conditions also apply:

a. The disturbed area is not connected to or associated with a larger ravine system, the Puget Sound shoreline or Chambers Creek Canyon bluffs; and

b. The slope is the result of human-caused activities, including regrading through mining, excavation and/or filling.

E. Buffer Protection. To increase the functional attributes of the buffer, the Department may require that the buffer be enhanced through planting of indigenous species. The edge of the buffer area shall be clearly staked, flagged, and/or fenced prior to any site clearing or construction. The buffer boundary markers shall be clearly visible, durable, and permanently affixed to the ground. Site clearing shall not commence until the applicant has submitted written notice to the Department that buffer requirements of this chapter are met. Field marking shall remain until all construction and clearing phases are completed, and the Department has granted final project approval. Prior to final approval for subdivisions, short subdivisions binding site plans, planned development districts and commercial developments the buffer and slope shall be placed in a separate critical area tract or tracts, protective easement, public or private land trust dedication, or similarly preserved through an appropriate permanent protective mechanism as determined by the Department. All protected areas identified above shall remain undeveloped in perpetuity, except as they may be altered pursuant to this title.

F. Temporary Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan. Temporary erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be required for all regulated activities in landslide and erosion hazard areas. The temporary erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be consistent with the City’s Public Works Standards and must be implemented prior to the start of development activity on site.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.15.060 Title notification.

The owner of any site within a landslide hazard area shall record a notice with the Pierce County Auditor on a form provided by the Department, and generally in the form set forth below. This notice shall be in addition to any other title notification statement required by this title, although any such notices may be combined.

Owner(s) on his/her own behalf and on behalf of his/her heirs, successors and assigns hereby waives any right to assert any claim against the City for any loss, or damage to people or property either on or off the site resulting from soil movement by reason of or arising out of issuance of the permit(s) by the City for development on the property except only for such losses that may directly result from the sole negligence of the City. Furthermore, the City makes no promise that in the event of soil movement that adversely affects abutting streets or utilities that such streets or utilities will be restored following such soil movement.

B. If a habitat assessment demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that fish and wildlife habitat or species are not located on the site, the development can proceed without further requirements under this section; otherwise, a habitat management plan shall be submitted pursuant to UPMC 17.25.025.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.25.025 Habitat management plans.

A. Where fish and wildlife habitat is present on a proposed development site, a habitat management plan shall be prepared by a wildlife biologist with a degree in wildlife biology. The habitat management plan shall contain at a minimum the following:

1. A discussion of the project’s impacts on fish and wildlife habitat.

2. A discussion of Federal and/or State management recommendations for species or habitats located on the site.

3. A discussion of measures proposed to preserve existing habitats.

4. A discussion of proposed measures that mitigate impacts of the project.

5. A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect fish and wildlife habitat after the site has been fully developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs.

6. Such further information as the Director determines is necessary to adequately assess the impact of the regulated activity upon the habitat or species.

B. Habitat management plans shall be sent to the WDF&W and appropriate State and Federal agencies for comment.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.25.030 Regulation.

A. Development proposals shall consolidate habitat and vegetated open space in linked corridors to provide connectivity to off-site wildlife habitat.

B. Where habitat for Federally listed endangered or threatened species is present, development proposals must comply with the provisions of ESA. Consultation with Federal agencies may be required. Development proposals in such areas shall be denied unless the applicant can show conclusively that the project would not result in the taking of a Federally listed species.

C. Protection of fish and wildlife habitat shall not be required where such habitat is isolated or severely fragmented due to previous development and urbanization. Where an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, through submittal of a habitat assessment, that protection of on-site fish and wildlife habitat would not result in a viable long-term population, such protection measures shall not be required. For proposals subject to the Shoreline Master Program provisions in UPMC Title 18, the Director may not waive the requirement for protection of fish and wildlife habitat unless the proposal demonstrates how it will comply with the mitigation sequencing requirements per UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2) and achieve no net loss of shoreline ecological function.

The above language does not apply in the case of Federally listed endangered and threatened species and habitat areas that must be preserved pursuant to subsection (B) of this section.

D. All projects may be conditioned based on agency comments and the Director’s evaluation of impact to fish and wildlife habitat and species. Projects may be denied if the proposal will result in extirpation or isolation of a regulated fish or wildlife population, species or habitat area.

E. Habitat assessments, habitat management plans and the provisions of this section shall not be required for fish habitat areas where all development is outside of prescriptive creek and/or wetland buffers per UPMC 17.25.040.

17.35.005 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to avoid, or, in appropriate circumstances, to minimize, rectify, reduce or compensate for impacts arising from land development and other activities affecting wetlands. Additionally, the purpose of this chapter is to maintain and enhance the biological and physical functions of wetlands with respect to water quality maintenance, storm water and floodwater storage and conveyance, fish and wildlife habitat, primary productivity, recreation, education, and historic and cultural preservation. When avoiding impacts is not reasonable, mitigation should be implemented to achieve no net loss of wetlands in terms of acreage, function and value.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.010 Applicability and mapping.

This chapter shall apply to all areas satisfying the criteria for wetland presence. The Department has created wetland maps for general informational purpose. The presence or absence of wetlands on a site shall be based on field conditions observed at the site.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.015 Application and review procedure.

A. When any regulated activity is proposed on a site that may be within 200 feet of a wetland, an application containing the following shall be submitted to the Department:

1. Site plan(s); 

2. Wetland analysis report and/or delineation prepared by a qualified wetland specialist, if required;

3. Mitigation plan, if required;

4. Such other information as the Director determines is necessary to adequately evaluate the impact of the regulated activity on the wetland and buffer.

B. The procedure to obtain approval for a regulated activity on a site that contains wetlands and/or buffers shall be in accordance with UPMC Title 22, Administration of Development Regulations, which provides for consolidated and timely permit review.

C. Review and Approval. Approval of a regulated activity on a site that contains wetlands and/or wetland buffers shall be granted upon a determination that the wetland analysis report and mitigation plan meet all applicable requirements and that the mitigation plan, monitoring program and contingency plan, if required, are tied to an acceptable financial guarantee. Except as specifically exempted, regulated activities within wetlands and wetland buffers shall not be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that mitigation sequencing is considered pursuant to the mitigation section of this chapter.

D. Expiration. Approvals shall be valid for a period of time equal to the time that any associated land use permit or approval is valid.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.020 Wetland categories.

Wetland categories shall be determined based upon the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington, current edition. Wetlands shall be generally categorized as follows:

A. Category I wetlands are:

1. Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

2. Wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR;

3. Bogs;

4. Mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre;

5. Wetlands in coastal lagoons; and

6. Wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more).

These wetlands:

1. Represent unique or rare wetland types;

2. Are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands;

3. Are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or

4. Provide a high level of functions.

B. Category II wetlands are:

1. Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre; or

2. Wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points).

C. Category III wetlands are:

1. Wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19 points); or

2. Wetlands that often can be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project.

Wetlands scoring between 16 and 19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.

D. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scoring less than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that should be able to be replaced, or in some cases to be improved upon. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 630 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002. Formerly 17.35.030).


17.35.025 Delineation and wetland analysis requirements.

Regulated activities shall comply with the following requirements:

A. The Department may require a delineation report prepared in accordance with the approved Federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements to determine if a regulated wetland is present on the site or to determine if the proposed activity is within 200 feet of a wetland. All areas within the City meeting the wetland designation criteria in this procedure are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter. A wetland delineation report shall be prepared by a qualified wetland specialist. The delineation report shall indicate wetland and/or buffer boundaries that may extend onto the site. While the delineation report shall discuss all wetland areas within 200 feet of the site, only those boundaries within the site property lines need be marked in the field. A preliminary site inspection may be required by the Department to determine whether a delineation report is needed.

B. If, on the basis of a delineation report, the Department determines that a regulated wetland is on the site, or within 200 feet of the site so that a wetland buffer boundary may extend onto the site, then the Department shall require a wetland analysis report. A wetland analysis report must be prepared by a qualified wetland specialist. A wetland analysis report shall include the following:

1. Vicinity map; 

2. When available, a copy of a National Wetland Inventory Map (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) and/or a City wetland inventory map identifying the wetlands on or adjacent to the site;

3. A site map setting forth all of the following:

a. Surveyed wetland boundaries based upon a delineation by a wetland specialist;

b. Site boundary property lines and roads;

c. Internal property lines, rights-of-way, easements, etc.;

d. Existing physical features of the site including buildings, fences, and other structures, roads, parking lots, utilities, water bodies, etc.;

e. Contours at the smallest readily available intervals, preferably at two-foot intervals;

f. Hydrologic mapping showing patterns of surface water movement and known subsurface water movement into, through, and out of the site area;

g. Location of all test holes and vegetation sample sites, numbered to correspond with flagging in the field and field data sheets;

h. The Department may require an air photo with overlays displaying the site boundaries and wetland delineation;

4. A report that includes the following:

a. Location information (legal description, parcel number and address);

b. Delineation report. The wetland boundaries on the site established by the delineation shall be staked and flagged in the field. If the wetland extends outside the site, the delineation report shall discuss all wetland areas within 200 feet of the site, but need only delineate those wetland boundaries within the site;

c. General site conditions including topography, acreage, and surface areas of all wetlands identified in the City wetland atlas and water bodies within one-quarter mile of the subject wetland(s);

d. Hydrological analysis, including topography, of existing surface and known significant subsurface flows into and out of the subject wetland(s);

e. Analysis of functional values of existing wetlands, including vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic conditions;

5. A summary of proposed activity and potential impacts to the wetland(s);

6. Recommended wetland category, including rationale for the recommendation;

7. Recommended buffer boundaries, including rationale for boundary locations;

8. Proposed on-site residential density transfer from wetlands and/or buffers to upland areas;

9. Site plan of proposed activity, including location of all parcels, tracts, easements, roads, structures, and other modifications to the existing site. The location of all wetlands and buffers shall be identified on the site plan.

C. The Department shall review and approve the wetland analysis report to determine the appropriate wetland category and buffer, and shall include the wetland in the City wetland maps and inventory if not already included. The Department shall approve the report’s findings and proposals unless specific, written reasons are provided which justify not doing so.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.030 Exemptions.

In addition to the activities and uses listed in UPMC 17.10.035, the following activities are exempt from the provisions of this chapter. Such activities are not exempt from the Shoreline Master Program requirements in UPMC Title 18 unless explicitly named as an exempt activity under WAC 173-27-040, in accordance with UPMC 18.15.030.

A. Subject to BMPs, construction or reconstruction of single-family, duplex or condominium units on a lot that was platted, or approved pursuant to a planned development district (PDD), prior to adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Structures shall be located outside of buffers in effect when the lot was created and shall be subject to the wetland regulations in effect at that time. A completed building permit application for the construction or reconstruction must be submitted within five years of final plat or PDD approval, or this exemption does not apply.

B. Pursuant to BMPs, construction of a one-family dwelling and regulated activities accessory to a one-family dwelling on a lot of record that was legally created prior to the effective date of this regulation shall be allowed in the buffer if all of the following provisions are met:

1. Development outside the buffer is not feasible.

2. The applicant demonstrates to the department that adverse impacts to wetlands will be mitigated to the greatest extent possible.

3. The residence and accessory structures are located to minimize intrusion into the buffer to the greatest extent possible.

C. Activities in artificial wetlands, except those artificial wetlands intentionally created for replacement, enhancement or similar purposes.

D. Activities affecting isolated Category III and IV wetlands less than 1,000 square feet that:

1. Are not associated with riparian areas or buffers.

2. Are not part of a wetland mosaic.

3. Do not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife or species of local importance identified by the City.

E. Placement of access roads, utility lines and utility poles across a Category IV wetland and/or a buffer for a Category IV wetland if there is no reasonable alternative and if construction activity is conducted in accordance with BMPs.

F. For legally established gardens and landscaped areas existing on the effective date of this regulation, activities to maintain their existing condition and appearance. Activities may include, but are not limited to, mowing lawns, weeding, harvesting and replanting of garden crops, pruning and planting of vegetation. Use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers is prohibited.

G. Activities designed for protection, maintenance and enhancement of wetlands, if approved by the Director.

H. Pursuant to BMPs, activities undertaken on the site of an existing holding pond, water quality facility or similar facility, intended to improve water quality, flow control or other primary function of the facility.

I. Public stormwater retention/detention facilities and stormwater conveyance facilities such as bioswales, open trenches and culverts not designed to drain wetlands may be constructed within Category II, III and IV wetland buffers; provided, that the following conditions are met:

1. No untreated stormwater is released from the facility into the wetland or buffer;

2. The applicant demonstrates that water levels within the wetland will be maintained at pre-existing levels;

3. Water levels are monitored annually to ensure that pre-existing functions of the wetland are not significantly lost through fluctuations in wetland hydrology;

4. Maintenance activity is limited to removal of invasive vegetation and/or removal of sediment accumulation at inflow structures in a manner acceptable to the Department;

5. All construction activity is conducted in accordance with accepted BMPs. This conditional exemption would not apply in situations where there are threatened or endangered species, or sensitive plants, unless approved by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife or Department of Natural Resources, respectively. All permits from other regulatory agencies must be obtained.

6. In shoreline jurisdiction, stormwater facilities shall not be located within the buffer of Category II wetlands unless there is no other feasible option. In Category III and IV wetland buffers within shoreline jurisdiction, these facilities shall be limited to the outer 25 percent of the buffer unless there is no other feasible option.

J. A utility line may be placed in an underground trench within a Category II, III or IV wetland or its buffer, although generally, boring is preferred to trenching unless infeasible for a specific proposal. Such activities are not exempt from the provisions of this chapter when located in an associated wetland as defined in UPMC 18.10.020. These activities should be discouraged where there is a high water table and be limited to the outer 25 percent of buffers unless there is no feasible alternative. Boring and trenching should not be permitted in Category II wetlands or their buffers unless there is no other option, due to the lengthy recovery time from disturbance in such wetlands. There must be no resulting changes in pre-construction contours, and trench excavation materials that are temporarily sidecast must be stabilized to prevent erosion and sedimentation. All sidecast materials shall be replaced within the trench or removed after 90 days, unless the Department grants an extension. The trench shall be the minimum size required to construct the utility line. The top 12 inches of the trench shall be backfilled with topsoil from the trench excavation. Trenches in wetlands shall be backfilled with wetland topsoil from the excavation. Trench excavation should be restricted to the dry season. All permits from other regulatory agencies must be obtained.

K. Subject to BMPs, placement of utility lines which do not require excavation or utility poles, in any part of a buffer for a Category III or IV wetland. They may be placed in a buffer for a Category I or II wetland, provided they are not located closer than one-half the buffer width from the edge of the wetland.

L. Public park improvements, including construction of public trails and associated viewing platforms, subject to BMPs, provided no net loss of wetlands occurs.

(Ord. 630 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002. Formerly 17.35.020).


17.35.035 Establishing buffers.

A. Buffer widths shall be determined according to Table 3 and the provisions of this section.

The standard buffer widths in Table 3 have been established in accordance with the best available science. They are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State wetland rating system for Western Washington.

1. The use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the measures in Table 4, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses.

2. If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 4, then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required. For example, a 75-foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100-foot buffer without them.

3. The standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

4. Additional buffer widths are added to the standard buffer widths. For example, a Category I wetland scoring nine points for habitat function would require a buffer of 225 feet (75 plus 150).

Table 3 – Wetland Buffer Requirements  

	 	Buffer Width (in feet) Based on Habitat Score

	Wetland Category	3 – 4	5	6 – 7	8 – 9

	Category I:

Based on Total Score	75	105	165	225

	Category I:

Bogs and Wetlands of High Conservation Value	190	225

	Category I:

Coastal Lagoons	150	165	225

	Category I:

Forested	75	105	165	225

	Category I:

Estuarine	150

(buffer width not based on habitat scores)

	Category II:

Based on Score	75	105	165	225

	Category III (all)	60	105	165	225

	Category IV (all)	40

 

Table 4 – Required Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands  

	Disturbance 	Required Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	• Direct lights away from wetland

	Noise	• Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland

• If warranted, enhance existing buffer with native vegetation plantings adjacent to noise source

• For activities that generate relatively continuous, potentially disruptive noise, such as certain heavy industry or mining, establish an additional 10 ft heavily vegetated buffer strip immediately adjacent to the outer wetland buffer

	Toxic runoff	• Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered

• Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 ft of wetland

• Apply integrated pest management

	Stormwater runoff	• Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development

• Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer

• Use low intensity development techniques (per the Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound, prepared by the Washington State University Extension and Puget Sound Partnership)

	Change in water regime	• Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns

	Pets and human disturbance	• Use privacy fencing OR plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion

• Place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract or protect with a conservation easement

	Dust	• Use best management practices to control dust

	Disruption of corridors or connections	• Maintain connections to off-site areas that are undisturbed

• Restore corridors or connections to off-site habitats by replanting

B. Buffer averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

1. The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a “dual-rated” wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower-rated area.

2. The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher-functioning area of habitat or more-sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower-functioning or less-sensitive portion as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional.

3. The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

4. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either 75 percent of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III, and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater. See Figure 35-1.

C. Buffer averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following are met:

1. There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging.

2. The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional.

3. The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

4. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either 75 percent of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater. See Figure 35-1.

D. The Department may require increased buffer width on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the regulated wetland. Such determination shall demonstrate that:

1. The wetland is used by a plant or animal species listed by the Federal government or the State as endangered, threatened, candidate, sensitive, monitored or documentary priority species or habitats, or essential or outstanding habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or

2. The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion, and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; or

3. The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than 30 percent.

E. To facilitate long-range planning using a landscape approach, the Department may identify and preassess wetlands using the rating system and establish appropriate wetland buffer widths for such wetlands. The Department will prepare maps of wetlands that have been preassessed in this manner.

F. Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured perpendicular from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. Only fully vegetated buffers will be considered. Lawns, walkways, driveways, and other mowed or paved areas will not be considered buffers or included in buffer area calculations.

G. Buffers on Mitigation Sites. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter. Buffers shall be based on the expected or target category of the proposed wetland mitigation site.

H. Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed or enhanced condition. In the case of compensatory mitigation sites, removal of invasive nonnative weeds is required for the duration of the financial guarantee required in UPMC 17.35.045.

I. Overlapping Critical Area Buffers. If buffers for two contiguous critical areas overlap (such as buffers for a stream and a wetland), the wider buffer applies.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 630 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.040 Buffer provisions.

A. When buffer boundaries have been determined they shall be marked in the field by a licensed surveyor. The markers shall be clearly visible, durable, and permanently affixed to the ground.

B.  Prior to final project approval, the part of the wetland and/or buffer that is on the site shall be placed in a separate wetland tract or tracts, protective easement, public or private land trust dedication, or similarly preserved through an appropriate permanent protective mechanism as determined by the City. All wetland tracts, protective easements, land trust dedications and other similarly preserved areas shall remain undeveloped in perpetuity, except as they may be altered pursuant to this chapter.

C. Prior to final project approval of any wetland application, the common boundary between a wetland tract, protective easement, land trust dedication, or other similarly preserved area and the adjacent land shall be identified with permanent signs and/or fencing. Sign and fencing locations, wording, and size and design specifications shall be as required by the Department.

D. A building setback line of eight feet shall be required from the outside edge of the buffer (See Figure 35-3). The eight-foot building setback shall be required regardless of the width of the buffer. The eight-foot building setback shall be considered a minimum setback and shall not be construed to reduce or eliminate additional setbacks as required by another regulation, code, or State or Federal law.


[IMAGE]


E. At any time after a wetland tract, protective easement, land trust dedication, or other similarly preserved area has been established, the owner may submit a delineation report to the Department. If the owner can demonstrate that a natural boundary change has occurred, or that a wetland no longer exists, the wetland tract, protective easement, land trust dedication, or other similarly preserved area may be altered or eliminated, as appropriate. If a wetland boundary has changed or a wetland has been eliminated due wholly or in part to illegal activity, a change or elimination of wetland tract, protective easement, land trust dedication, or other similarly preserved area shall not be permitted.

F. A wetland tract, protective easement, land trust dedication, or other similarly preserved area is not required for utility lines in easements on lands not owned by the jurisdiction conducting the regulated activity.

G. Except as otherwise specified, buffers shall be retained in a natural condition.

H. The wetland buffer shall not extend away from the wetland beyond an existing substantial linear improvement such as an improved road, dike, or levee, where an applicant can show that such existing improvement significantly reduces the impact the proposed activities would have on the wetland.

I. The Department may require protection measures or erosion control measures such as temporary or permanent fencing to provide for protection of a wetland and buffer when any regulated activities are proposed on a site, but are not proposed within a wetland and/or buffer.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.045 Mitigation.

Regulated activities within wetlands and buffers shall be mitigated pursuant to this chapter. Where SEPA environmental review is required, a threshold determination may not be made prior to Department review of the mitigation plan.

A. All activities in wetlands and/or buffers shall be mitigated according to this section and the Department of Ecology manual: Wetland Mitigation in Washington State, Part 1: Agency Policies and Guidance (Version 1, Publication No. 06-06-011a, March 2006) and Wetland Mitigation in Washington State, Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1, Publication No. 06-06-011b, March 2006). Except as specifically exempted, regulated activities shall not be permitted within wetlands and/or buffers unless an applicant demonstrates that all reasonable attempts have been made to avoid impacts to the wetland and/or buffer. Mitigation is considered in order of preference as noted below with (1) being most preferable and (5) being the least preferable. Applicants must establish that mitigation has been considered in order of preference prior to permit issuance. There may be circumstances when an alternative mitigation strategy is preferable.

1. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of actions within the wetland and/or buffer;

2. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

3. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

4. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

5. Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments;

6. Monitoring the required compensation and taking remedial or corrective measures when necessary.

Mitigation for individual actions may include a combination of the above measures. Monitoring may be a part of one or more of the above measures.

B. Regulated activities which occur in buffers, and which will not eliminate wetland habitat, shall be mitigated according to a mitigation plan approved by the Department. A mitigation plan for regulated activities in buffers shall contain the following components:

1. General goals of the mitigation plan;

2. Approximated site topography before and after alteration;

3. Location of proposed mitigation area;

4. General hydrologic patterns on the site before and after construction;

5. General plant selection and justification, planting instructions, and approximate planting sequencing and schedule;

6. A maintenance plan;

7. A monitoring and contingency plan;

8. A financial guarantee to ensure maintenance and/or implementation of the contingency plan. The financial guarantee must be equal to or greater than 20 percent of the estimated cost of the mitigation work, but in no case shall be less than is necessary to implement the contingency plan.

C. Compensatory mitigation shall be required for filling wetlands and for other regulated activities in wetlands. Compensatory mitigation shall be accomplished per the Department of Ecology manual: Guidelines for Developing Freshwater Wetlands Mitigation Plans and Proposals, current edition. The above-referenced document was developed jointly by six agencies including the Washington State Department of Ecology and Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These agencies, together with the City, have regulatory authority over wetland filling and related mitigation. Consistency with the above-referenced document will ensure that submitted plans are adequately detailed for review by all responsible agencies. Replacement ratios for compensatory mitigation shall be pursuant to the subsection below.

1. When regulated activities occur in wetlands, the applicant shall preserve, restore, create, or enhance equivalent areas of wetlands. Equivalent areas shall be determined according to acreage, functional value, type, location, time factors, and projected success. No overall net losses shall occur in wetland acreage, functions and/or values, and any restored, created, or enhanced wetland shall be as persistent as the wetland it replaces. Buffers pursuant to UPMC 17.35.035 shall be provided for created, restored or enhanced wetlands.

2. When an applicant proposes to alter or eliminate wetland, the applicant shall replace, restore and/or enhance acreage at the following ratios:

 

Table 5 – Wetland Mitigation Replacement Ratios* 

	Category and Type of Wetland	Creation or Re-establishment	Rehabilitation	Enhancement	Preservation

	Category I: Bog, Natural Heritage site	Not considered possible	6:1	Case by case	10:1

	Category I: Mature Forested	6:1	12:1	24:1	24:1

	Category I: Based on functions	4:1	8:1	16:1	20:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	12:1	20:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	8:1	15:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	6:1	10:1

*Ratios read as follows: Acreage replaced: Acreage lost

3. Ratios provided are for proposed projects with in-kind replacement that occurs prior to regulated activities on the site. Replaced, restored or enhanced wetlands must be located within the same drainage basin as the filled wetland, but are not required to be located on the same property. The Department may increase the ratios under the following circumstances:

a. Uncertainty as to the probable success of the proposed restoration, enhancement or creation; or

b. Significant period of time between destruction and replication of wetland functions; or

c. Projected losses in wetland functional value; or

d. Out-of-kind compensation.

4. The Department may allow the minimum acreage replacement ratio to be decreased if the applicant provides findings of special studies coordinated with agencies with expertise, which demonstrate that no net loss of wetland function or value results from the decreased ratio. In no case shall the Department approve a ratio less than 1:1.

5. In-kind compensation shall be provided except where the applicant demonstrates that:

a. Greater functional and habitat values can be achieved through out-of-kind mitigation; or

b. The wetland system is already significantly degraded; or

c. Problems such as the presence of exotic vegetation and changes in watershed hydrology make implementation of in-kind compensation infeasible; or

d. Out-of-kind replacement will best meet identified regional goals (e.g., replacement of historically diminished wetland types).

D. Credit/Debit Method. To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the joint guidance “Wetland Mitigation in Washington State Parts I and II” (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a-b, Olympia, WA, March, 2006), the Department may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in “Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Operational Draft,” (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, Olympia, WA, February 2011, or as revised).

E. Financial Guarantees. Mitigation shall be accomplished prior to the start of any regulated activity that impacts wetland area.

1. If development permits are issued prior to completion of mitigation work, financial guarantees shall be required to ensure mitigation is completed. Financial guarantees shall be 125 percent of the estimated cost of implementation of the mitigation plan.

2. Appropriate financial guarantees shall be in place to ensure that maintenance, monitoring and/or contingency plans shall be accomplished. Financial guarantees for contingency plans should be 20 percent of the cost of implementation of the mitigation plan.

F. Wetland mitigation banking may be permitted as a flexible alternative to standard compensatory mitigation. Wetland mitigation banking shall be conducted per the requirements of Chapter 173-700 WAC.

1. Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:

a. The bank is certified under State rules;

b. The Department determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

c. The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.

2. Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

3. Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, the service area of the bank may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions.

G. In-Lieu Fee. To aid in the implementation of off-site mitigation, the City may develop a program which prioritizes wetland areas for use as mitigation and/or allows payment in lieu of providing mitigation on a development site. This program shall be developed and approved through a public process and be consistent with State and Federal rules. The program should address:

1. The identification of sites within the City that are suitable for use as off-site mitigation. Site suitability shall take into account wetland functions, potential for wetland degradation, and potential for urban growth and service expansion; and

2. The use of fees for mitigation on available sites that have been identified as suitable and prioritized.

H. Advance Mitigation. Mitigation for projects with pre-identified impacts to wetlands may be constructed in advance of the impacts if the mitigation is implemented according to State and Federal rules.

I. Alternative Mitigation Plans. The Department may approve alternative critical areas mitigation plans that are based on best available science, such as priority restoration plans that achieve restoration goals identified in the SMP. Alternative mitigation proposals must provide an equivalent or better level of protection of critical area functions and values than would be provided by the strict application of this chapter.

The Department shall consider the following for approval of an alternative mitigation proposal:

1. The proposal uses a watershed approach consistent with Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Ecology Publication No. 09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009);

2. Creation or enhancement of a larger system of natural areas and open space is preferable to the preservation of many individual habitat areas;

3. Mitigation according to subsection (E) of this section is not feasible due to site constraints such as parcel size, stream type, wetland category, or geologic hazards;

4. There is clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the proposed mitigation site;

5. The plan shall contain clear and measurable standards for achieving compliance with the specific provisions of the plan. A monitoring plan shall, at a minimum, meet the provisions in subsection (J) of this section;

6. The plan shall be reviewed and approved as part of overall approval of the proposed use, Wetlands Guidance for Small Cities Western Washington Version Page A-23;

7. A wetland of a different type is justified based on regional needs or functions and values; the replacement ratios may not be reduced or eliminated unless the reduction results in a preferred environmental alternative;

8. Mitigation guarantees shall meet the minimum requirements as outlined in subsection (B)(8) of this section;

9. Qualified professionals in each of the critical areas addressed shall prepare the plan;

10. The City may consult with agencies with expertise and jurisdiction over the resources during the review to assist with analysis and identification of appropriate performance measures that adequately safeguard critical areas.

J. Monitoring Program and Contingency Plan.

1. If the wetland mitigation plan includes compensatory mitigation, a monitoring program shall be implemented to determine the success of the compensatory mitigation project.

2. Specific criteria shall be provided for evaluating the mitigation proposal relative to the goals and objectives of the project and for beginning remedial action or contingency measures. Such criteria may include water quality standards, survival rates of planted vegetation, species abundance and diversity targets, habitat diversity indices, or other ecological, geological or hydrological criteria.

3. A contingency plan shall be established for compensation in the event that the mitigation project is inadequate or fails.

4. Requirements of the monitoring program and contingency plan are as follows:

a. During monitoring, use scientific procedures for establishing the success or failure of the project;

b. For vegetation determinations, permanent sampling points shall be established;

c. Vegetative success equals 80 percent per year survival of planted trees and shrubs and 80 percent per year cover of desirable understory or emergent species;

d. Submit monitoring reports of the current status of the mitigation project to the Department. The reports are to be prepared by a qualified wetland specialist and shall include monitoring information on wildlife, vegetation, water quality, water flow, stormwater storage and conveyance, and existing or potential degradation, and shall be produced on the following schedule:

(1) At time of construction;

(2) Thirty days after planting;

(3) Early in the growing season of the first year;

(4) End of the growing season of first year;

(5) Twice the second year;

(6) Annually;

e. Monitor a minimum of three and up to 10 growing seasons, depending on the complexity of the wetland system. The time period will be determined and specified in writing prior to the implementation of the site plan;

f. If necessary, correct for failures in the mitigation project;

g. Replace dead or undesirable vegetation with appropriate plantings;

h. Repair damages caused by erosion, settling, or other geomorphological processes;

i. Redesign mitigation project (if necessary) and implement the new design;

j. Correction procedures shall be approved by a qualified wetland specialist and the City’s environmental official.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 630 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.050 Residential density and on-site density transfer.

The purpose of on-site density transfer is to cluster development in a manner that provides protection for wetlands and allows transfer of residential density from a wetland and/or wetland buffer area to an area on the same site that is neither wetland nor buffer. Those portions of the wetland and/or wetland buffer in which regulated activities are proposed to occur shall not be considered in calculating density transfer. Density transfer shall be determined as follows:

A. For sites containing regulated wetland buffer areas, full density credit may be transferred from the buffer area to the non-buffer area.

B. For sites containing regulated wetland areas, density transfer shall be calculated from the following table:

Table 6 – On-Site Density Transfer 

	Percentage of site in wetland	Amount of credit

	0–25%	75%

	26–50%	50%

	50–100%	25%

C. If an on-site density transfer would result in the creation of one or more lots smaller than the minimum lot size specified for lots within a conventional plat, the subdivision shall be designed and processed in accordance with the Design Standards and Guidelines for Small Lot and Multifamily Development adopted by reference in Chapter 19.53 UPMC.

(Ord. 566 § 1, 2010; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.35.055 Alternative review process, Corps of Engineers Section 404 individual permits.

When an Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permit is required for a project involving wetlands, the Army Corps permitting process may be substituted for the City permitting process, except when the project is located within an associated wetland as defined in UPMC 18.10.020. If a proposal reviewed and conditioned by the Corps satisfies the intent of this chapter, no further wetland review shall be required by the City. All permits and approvals required by other City development regulations shall be required.

(Ord. 630 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).

17.40.030 Designation of responsible official.

For those proposals for which the City of University Place is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the director of the Department of Economic and Community Development or his/her designee. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.035 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.

A. The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-944, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

B. When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

C. If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-944, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by the planning director.

D. Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

E. Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal.

F. For all proposals for which the City of University Place is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the “lead agency” or “responsible official” by the SEPA rules.

G. In addition, the responsible official shall be responsible for preparation of written comments for the city in response to a consultation request prior to a threshold determination, participation in scoping, and/or reviewing a DEIS.

H. This person shall be responsible for the city’s compliance with WAC 197-11-502, and 197-11-545, and 197-11-550 whenever the city is a consulted agency and is authorized to develop operating procedures that will ensure that responses to consultation requests are prepared in a timely fashion and include data from all appropriate departments of the city.

I. The City of University Place shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules (Chapter 197-11 WAC) and make them available in accordance with applicable regulations.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.040 Time limits applicable to SEPA review process.

The SEPA review process shall be integrated with the non-exempt action review process in accordance with University Place Municipal Code, Title 22. SEPA decisions shall be made as early in the process as possible. The following time limits shall apply when the city processes licenses for all private projects and those governmental proposals submitted to the city by other agencies:

A. Threshold Determinations.

1. If it is possible to make a threshold determination based solely upon review of the environmental checklist for the proposal, said determination shall be completed no less than 14 days and no later than 30 days from the date of submittal of the applicant’s complete application and checklist.

2. If the responsible official determines that it is necessary to obtain information in addition to that contained on the environmental checklist:

a. Such further information shall be requested within 30 days of receiving a complete application.

b. If neither the requested information nor a response asking for additional time is received within 30 days of the date of request, the responsible official shall find that said information is unavailable and proceed to make a determination without said information unless the applicant requests that the time for response be extended.

c. The threshold determination shall be completed within 30 days of receipt of the requested additional information from the applicant or the consulted agency; or within 30 days of finding that said information is unavailable.

3. If the city must initiate further studies, including, but not limited to, field investigations, to obtain the information necessary to make the threshold determination, such studies and the threshold determination shall be completed within 30 days of receipt of a complete application.

B. Other.

1. For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or Final EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission.

2. If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other administrative license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing or the city may require that an environmental review be conducted prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. If the applicant requests, the city shall conduct environmental review at that time, providing that the responsible official determines that adequate information about the proposal has been submitted. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.045 Categorical exemptions.

The City of University Place adopts by reference WAC 197-11-300 and 197-11-800. In addition thereto, University Place establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under WAC 197-11-800(1):

A. For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i): 10 dwelling units or less if within one structure;

B. For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iv): 30 or fewer automobile parking spaces;

C. For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v): 250 cubic yards or less. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.050 Use of exemptions.

A. When receiving an application for a license, or when receiving a city-initiated proposal, the responsible official shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The responsible official’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

B. In assessing whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible official shall determine that the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the official shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

C. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

1. The city shall not give authorization for:

a. Any nonexempt action;

b. Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or 

c. Any action that would limit the choice of responsible alternatives;

2. The city may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment when such modification would serve no purpose if later approval of a related major action is not secured; and

3. The city may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if later approval of a major related action is secured. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.055 Critical areas.

A. In accordance with WAC 197-11-908, the City of University Place designates environmentally sensitive areas:

1. Areas designated natural by the city’s shoreline management master program environment maps.

2. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, erosion hazard areas, landslide hazard areas, aquifer recharge areas, steep slopes, wetlands and streams, as described in this Title.

3. The following categorical exemptions set forth in WAC 197-11-800 shall not apply when a project proposal is located in or partially within sensitive areas: WAC 197-11-800(1), (2c), (2e), (2f), (2g), (6a), and (25h).

B. The city shall treat proposals located wholly or partially within an environmentally sensitive area no differently than other proposals under this chapter, making a threshold determination for all such proposals. The city shall not automatically require an EIS for a proposal merely because it is proposed for location in an environmentally sensitive area.

C. Certain exemptions do not apply to lands covered by water, regardless of whether such lands covered by water are mapped. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.060 Emergency action exemption.

A. The following actions, which must be undertaken immediately or for which there is insufficient time for full compliance with this chapter, are exempt from the procedural requirements of this chapter:

1. Actions necessary to prevent an imminent threat to public health or safety;

2. Actions necessary to prevent an imminent danger to public or private property; or

3. Actions necessary to prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental degradation.

B. The responsible official shall determine on a case-by-case basis emergency action that satisfies the general requirements of this section.

C. Adoption of interim zoning or moratorium. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.065 Environmental checklist.

A. A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed for any permit, license, certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA review has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and for making the threshold determination.

B. All private applicants shall complete their own environmental checklist, with assistance from the city as necessary. City departments initiating a proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

C. The city may require that it, rather than the private applicant, complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

1. The city has access to technical information not available to the private applicant; or

2. The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.070 Determination of non-significance (DNS).

A. If the responsible official determines there will be no probable significant adverse environmental impacts from a proposal, the responsible official shall prepare and issue a determination of non-significance (DNS) substantially in the form provided in WAC 197-11-970. If the responsible official adopts another environmental document in support of a threshold determination, the notice of adoption in WAC 197-11-965 and the DNS shall be combined or attached to each other.

B. A DNS issued under the provisions of this section is final and effective as set forth in WAC 197-11-390. The filing of an appeal of a DNS pursuant to this chapter shall stay the effect of such DNS and no major action in regard to a proposal may be taken during the pendency of an appeal and until the appeal is finally disposed of by the city. A decision to reverse the determination of the responsible official and uphold the appeal shall further stay any decision, proceedings, or actions in regard to the proposal.

C. When a DNS is issued for any of the proposals listed in subsection (C)(1) of this section, the requirements in this subsection shall be met.

1. An agency shall not act upon a proposal for 14 days after the date of issuance of a DNS if the proposal involves:

a. Another agency with jurisdiction; 

b. Demolition of any structure or facility not exempted by WAC 197-11-800(2)(f) or UPMC 17.40.045; 

c. Issuance of clearing or grading permits not exempted in Part Nine of the SEPA rules;

d. A DNS under WAC 197-11-350(2), 197-11-350(3) or 197-11-360(4).

2. The responsible official shall send the DNS and environmental checklist to agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, and affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal, and shall give notice under WAC 197-11-510.

3. Any person, affected tribe, or agency may submit comments to the lead agency within 14 days of the date of issuance of the DNS.

4. The date of issuance for the DNS is the date the DNS is sent to the Department of Ecology and agencies with jurisdiction and is made publicly available.

5. An agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status only within this 14-day period (WAC 197-11-948).

6. The responsible official shall reconsider the DNS based on timely comments and may retain or modify the DNS or, if the responsible official determines that significant adverse impacts are likely, withdraw the DNS. When a DNS is modified, the responsible official shall send the modified DNS to agencies with jurisdiction.

D. Withdrawal of DNS. 

1. The responsible official shall withdraw a DNS if:

a. There are substantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts;

b. There is significant new information indicating, or on, a proposal’s probable significant adverse environmental impacts; or

c. The DNS was procured by misrepresentation or lack of material disclosure; if the DNS resulted from such actions by an applicant, any subsequent environmental checklist on the proposal shall be prepared directly by the responsible official or his or her consultants at the expense of the applicant.

2. Subsection (D)(1)(b) of this section shall not apply when a nonexempt license has been issued on a private project.

3. If the responsible official withdraws a DNS, a new threshold determination shall be made and other agencies with jurisdiction shall be notified of the withdrawal and new threshold determination. If a DS is issued, each agency with jurisdiction shall commence action to suspend, modify, or revoke any approvals until the necessary environmental review has occurred. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.075 Mitigated DNS.

A. As provided in this section, the responsible official may issue a determination of non-significance (DNS) based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B. If an applicant requests early notice of whether a DS is likely, the request must:

1. Be written;

2. Follow submission of an environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

3. Precede the department’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C. The responsible official shall respond to the request in writing; the response shall:

1. State whether the responsible official is considering issuance of a determination of significance (DS) and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that are leading to consideration of DS; and

2. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the impacts indicated in the letter, revising the environmental checklist as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D. As much as possible, the responsible official should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

E. If the applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised environmental checklist, the responsible official will make a threshold determination based on the changed or clarified proposal:

1. If the responsible official indicated specific mitigation measures in a response to the request for early notice that would allow him or her to issue a DNS, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the responsible official shall issue a determination of non-significance.

2. If the responsible official indicated general or specific areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow a DNS to be issued, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes, or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific.

4. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

F. A mitigated DNS requires a 14-day comment period.

G. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit, unless revised or changed by the decision-maker. The conditions shall be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.

H. The responsible official’s written response under subsection (C) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussions of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the responsible official to a mitigated DNS.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.080 Scoping.

A. The responsible official shall narrow the scope of every EIS to the probable significant adverse impacts and reasonable alternatives, including mitigation measures. For example, if there are only two or three significant impacts or reasonable alternatives, the EIS shall be focused on those.

B. To ensure that every EIS is concise and addresses the significant environmental issues, the responsible official shall:

1. Invite agencies with jurisdiction, if any, affected tribes, and the public to comment on the DS (WAC 197-11-360). The responsible official shall require comments in writing. Agencies with jurisdiction, affected tribes, and the public shall be allowed 21 days from the date of issuance of the DS in which to comment, unless expanded scoping is used. The date of issuance for a DS is the date it is sent to the Department of Ecology and other agencies with jurisdiction, and is publicly available;

2. Identify reasonable alternatives and probable significant adverse environmental impacts;

3. Eliminate from detailed study those impacts that are not significant;

4. Work with other agencies to identify and integrate environmental studies required for other government approvals with the EIS, where feasible.

C. Meetings or scoping documents, including notices that the scope has been revised, may be used but are not required. The responsible official shall integrate the scoping process with the existing planning and decision-making process in order to avoid duplication and delay.

D. The responsible official shall revise the scope of an EIS if substantial changes are made later in the proposal, or if significant new circumstances or information arise that bear on the proposal and its significant impacts.

E. DEISs shall be prepared according to the scope decided upon by the responsible official in the scoping process. 

F. EIS preparation may begin during scoping.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.085 Expanded scoping (optional).

The responsible official may expand the scoping process to include any or all of the provisions found in WAC 197-11-410, which may be applied on a proposal-by-proposal basis.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.090 Determination of significance.

In the event the responsible official determines that a proposal is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the quality of the environment, the responsible official shall prepare a determination of significance using the form in WAC 197-11-980. The responsible official shall also list the proposal in the “EIS in Preparation Register” maintained by the planning division. Thereafter, the EIS and scoping and preparation procedures specified by WAC 197-11-408 through and including 197-11-460 shall be followed. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.095 Withdrawal of threshold determination.

In some cases, as specified by WAC 197-11-340, 197-11-360 and 197-11-600, the city may withdraw its threshold determination. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.100 Environmental impact statement.

A. The city adopts by reference WAC 197-11-400 through 197-11-460, as now or hereafter amended. The contents and preparation procedures for draft environmental impact statements shall be governed by the SEPA rules herein or as hereafter amended.

B. Preparation of the draft and final EIS (DEIS and FEIS) and draft and final supplementation EISs (SEIS) shall be under the direction of the responsible official. Before the city issues an EIS, the responsible official shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter and Chapter 197-11 WAC.

1. The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be prepared by city staff, the applicant, or by a consultant selected by the city or the applicant, as determined by the responsible official. If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that someone other than the city will prepare the EIS, the responsible official shall notify the applicant within five calendar days after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also notify the applicant of the city’s procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution.

2. The city may require an applicant to provide information the city does not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is not required to supply information not required under this chapter or information requested from another agency pursuant to this chapter.

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).


17.40.105 Public notice.

A. Whenever the City of University Place issues a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2), a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3), a DEIS under WAC 197-11-455(5) or a SEIS under WAC 197-11-620, notice shall be given as follows:

1. The project applicant shall ensure notice is given by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or general area where the proposal is located as determined by the responsible official.

2. The responsible official may require notice by alternative methods or additional notice such as posting the property if deemed necessary to provide adequate public notice of a pending action.

3. Whenever the city issues a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3), the city shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal in the DS as required in WAC 197-11-408 and in the public notice.

B. The applicant is required to complete the public notice requirements for his/her proposal and provide affidavits of publishing to the city planning department. The applicant will be required to pay the cost of any notice required pursuant to subsections (A)(2) and (A)(3) of this section. 

(Ord. 343 § 1, 2002).

The purpose of the Shoreline Master Program is:

A. To guide the future development of shorelines in the City of University Place in a positive, effective, and equitable manner consistent with the Washington State Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (Act), as amended (Chapter 90.58 RCW).

B. To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community by providing long-range, comprehensive policies and effective, reasonable regulations for development and use of University Place’s shorelines; and

C. To ensure, at minimum, no net loss of shoreline ecological functions and processes and to plan for restoring shorelines that have been impaired or degraded by adopting and fostering the policy contained in RCW 90.58.020, Legislative Findings for shorelines of the State.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.05.020 Governing principles.

A. The goals, policies and regulations of this Shoreline Master Program are based on the governing principles in the Shoreline Master Program Guidelines, WAC 173-26-186 and the policy statement of RCW 90.58.020.

B. In implementing the objective of RCW 90.58.020 for shorelines of Statewide significance, the City will base decisions in preparing and administering this Shoreline Program on the following principles, in order of priority:

1. Recognize and protect the Statewide interest over local interest;

2. Preserve the natural character of the shoreline;

3. Support actions that result in long-term benefits over short-term benefits;

4. Protect the resources and ecology of the shoreline;

5. Increase public access to publicly owned areas of the shoreline;

6. Increase recreational opportunities for public on the shoreline;

7. Provide for any other element as defined in RCW 90.58.100 as deemed appropriate.

C. Any inconsistencies between this Shoreline Program and the Act must be resolved in accordance with the Act.

D. The policies of this Shoreline Program may be achieved by diverse means, one of which is regulation. Other means authorized by the Act include but are not limited to the following: acquisition of lands and/or easements by purchase or gift, incentive programs, and implementation of capital facility and/or nonstructural programs.

E. Regulation of private property to implement Shoreline Program goals such as public access and protection of ecological functions and processes must be consistent with all relevant constitutional and other legal limitations. These include, but are not limited to, civil rights guaranteed by the U.S. and State constitutions, recent Federal and State case law, and State statutes, such as RCW 34.05.328 and 43.21C.060 and Chapter 82.02 RCW.

F. Regulatory or administrative actions contained herein must be implemented consistent with the Public Trust Doctrine and other applicable legal principles as appropriate and must not unconstitutionally infringe on private property rights or result in an unconstitutional taking of private property.

G. The regulatory provisions of this Shoreline Program are limited to shorelines of the State, whereas the planning functions of this Shoreline Program may extend beyond the designated shoreline boundaries.

H. The policies and regulations established by this Shoreline Program will be integrated and coordinated with those policies and rules of the University Place Comprehensive Plan and development regulations adopted under the Growth Management Act (GMA).

I. The policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program are intended to protect shoreline ecological functions by:

1. Requiring that current and potential ecological functions be identified and understood when evaluating new or expanded uses and developments;

2. Requiring adverse impacts to be mitigated in a manner that ensures no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. Mitigation, as defined in UPMC 18.10.020, shall include avoidance as a first priority, followed by minimizing, and then replacing/compensating for lost functions and/or resources;

3. Ensuring that all uses and developments, including preferred uses and uses that are exempt from a shoreline substantial development permit, will not cause a net loss of shoreline ecological functions;

4. Preventing, to the greatest extent practicable, cumulative impacts from individual developments;

5. Fairly allocating the burden of preventing cumulative impacts among development opportunities; and

6. Including regulations and regulatory incentives to restore shoreline ecological functions where such functions have been degraded by past actions.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.05.030 Title.

“Act” or “SMA” means the Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (Chapter 90.58 RCW as amended).

“Administrator” means that person or designee designated by the City to administer the provisions of University Place’s Shoreline Master Program.

“Alteration” means any human-induced change in existing conditions or a shoreline and/or its buffer. Alterations include, but are not limited to, excavation, grading, filling, channelization, dredging, clearing (vegetation), draining, constructing structures, compaction, or any other activity that changes the character of a site.

“Anadromous fish” means fish species that spend part of their life cycle in salt water, but return to freshwater to reproduce.

“Appurtenance, normal” means a structure or development that is necessarily connected to the use and enjoyment of a single-family residence and is located landward of the ordinary high water mark and the perimeter of a wetland. For a list of normal appurtenances in University Place, see UPMC 18.30.130(A).

“Aquacultural practices” means the hatching, cultivating, planting, feeding, raising, harvesting and processing of aquatic plants and animals, and the maintenance and construction of necessary equipment, buildings and growing areas. Methods of aquaculture include but are not limited to fish hatcheries, fish pens, shellfish rafts, racks and longlines, seaweed floats and the culture of clams and oysters on tidelands and subtidal areas. Aquaculture does not include the harvest of wild geoduck associated with the State-managed wildstock geoduck fishery or activities on private property for personal consumption.

“Aquatic zone” means the area waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

“Associated wetland” means wetlands that are in proximity to and either influence or are influenced by tidal waters or a lake or stream subject to the SMA. Factors used to determine whether wetlands meet the “proximity and influence” test include but are not limited to one or more of the following:

1. Periodic inundation;

2. Hydraulic continuity;

3. On marine waters, formation by tidally influenced geohydraulic processes, or a surface connection through a culvert or tide gate; and

4. On streams, the entire wetland is associated if any part is located within the 100-year floodplain of a shoreline or within 200 feet of the OHWM or floodway.

“Average grade level” means the average of the natural or existing topography of the portion of the lot, parcel, or tract of real property which will be directly under the proposed building or structure. In the case of structures to be built over water, average grade level is the elevation of the adjacent ordinary high water mark. The average grade level averages the ground elevations at the midpoint of all exterior walls of the proposed building or structure.

“Beach” means the zone along the shoreline where there is continuous movement of sediment both laterally and vertically. This zone extends from the daily low tide mark to where the relatively permanent line of vegetation begins.

“Beach enhancement” means the alteration of terrestrial and tidal shorelines along with submerged shorelines for the purpose of stabilization, recreational enhancement and aquatic habitat creation or restoration using native or similar material.

“Beach feeding” means the introduction of sand or gravel to beaches to enhance recreation or wildlife or to preserve natural physical character of the shoreline.

“Beach nourishment” means the process of replenishing a beach by artificial means, for example, by the deposition of dredged materials; also called beach replenishment or beach feeding.

“Bedlands” means those submerged lands below the line of extreme low tide in marine waters and below the line of navigability of navigable lakes and rivers.

“Berm” means one or several linear deposits of sand and gravel generally paralleling the shore at or landward of the ordinary high water mark; berms are naturally stable because of material size or vegetation.

“Bioengineering” means the practice of using vegetative materials and often structural components to stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. This may include use of bundles of stems, root systems, or other living plant material, soft gabions, fabric or other soil stabilization techniques, and limited rock toe protection where appropriate. Bioengineering projects often include habitat enhancement measures such as anchored logs, snags, and root wads. Bioengineering techniques may be applied to creeks, rivers, lakes, and marine waters, as well as upland areas away from the immediate shoreline.

“Boardwalk” means an overwater structure generally parallel to the shoreline for public pedestrian access.

“Boat ramp” means a slab, plank, rail, or graded slope used for launching boats by means of a trailer, hand, or mechanical device.

“Boathouse” means covered moorage that includes walls and a roof to protect the vessel.

“Boating facilities” means marinas located both landward and waterward of the ordinary high water mark (dry storage and wet-moorage types), yacht clubs with boat moorage and related facilities and activities, boat ramps, covered moorage, and marine travel lifts (mobile boat hoists).

“Breakwater” means protective structure usually built off-shore to protect harbor areas, moorage, navigation, beaches and bluffs from wave action. A breakwater may be fixed (e.g., a rubble mound or rigid wall), open-pile, or floating. Their primary purpose is to protect harbors, moorages and navigation activity from wave and wind action. A secondary purpose is to protect shorelines from erosion caused by wave action.

“Buffer” means an area or distance between a critical area or other protected or sensitive feature required or necessary for the continued maintenance, functioning, structural stability and/or ecological functions of that area, or to minimize risk or harm to the area, those functions, or the public resulting from existing, proposed, or potential nearby land uses or development.

“Buffer averaging” means variation in the width or shape of a buffer that does not result in reduction in the overall land area of the buffer.

“Bulkhead” means a wall usually constructed parallel to the shoreline for the primary purpose of containing and preventing the loss of soil or structure caused by erosion or wave action. Bulkheads are usually constructed near the ordinary high water mark of rock, poured-in-place concrete, steel or aluminum sheet piling, wood, or wood and structural steel combinations.

“Channel migration zone (CMZ)” means the area along a river within which the channel(s) can be reasonably predicted to migrate over time as a result of natural and normally occurring hydrological and related processes when considered with the characteristics of the river and its surroundings.

“Channelization” means the straightening, deepening or lining of stream channels, and/or prevention of natural meander progression of stream ways, through artificial means such as relocation of channels, dredging, and/or placement of continuous levees or bank revetments along significant portions of the stream; but not including dredging of sediment or debris alone.

“Conditional use, shoreline” means a use, development, or substantial development requiring special approval by applying the criteria of WAC 173-27-160.

“Covered moorage” means boat moorage, with or without walls, that has a roof to protect the vessel.

“Critical habitat” means habitat areas within which endangered, threatened, sensitive or monitored plant, fish, or wildlife species have a primary association (e.g., feeding, breeding, rearing of young, migrating). Such areas are identified herein with reference to lists, categories, and definitions promulgated by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife as identified in WAC 232-12-011 or 232-12-014; in the Priority Habitat and Species (PHS) program by the Department of Fish and Wildlife; or by rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, or other agency with jurisdiction for such designations. See WAC 173-26-221(2)(c)(iii) and (iv), respectively, regarding saltwater and freshwater habitat.

“Significant vegetation removal” means the removal or alteration of trees, shrubs, and/or ground cover by clearing, grading, cutting, burning, chemical means, or other activity that causes significant ecological impacts to functions provided by such vegetation. The removal of hazardous trees, invasive or noxious weeds does not constitute significant vegetation removal. Tree pruning, not including tree topping, where it does not affect ecological functions, does not constitute significant vegetation removal.

“Structure” means a permanent or temporary edifice or building, or any piece of work artificially built or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner, whether installed on, above, or below the surface of the ground or water, but not including vehicles and vessels.

“Submerged lands” means areas below the ordinary high water mark of marine waters, lakes and rivers.

“Substantial development” means any development of which the total cost or fair market value exceeds $7,047, or any development which materially interferes with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the State. (Note: The dollar threshold above is adjusted for inflation by the Washington Office of Financial Management every five years, beginning July 1, 2007, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period.) See RCW 90.58.030.

“Substantially degrade” means to cause damage or harm to an area’s ecological functions. An action is considered to substantially degrade the environment if it damages ecological function or functions, significantly affects other related functions or the viability of the larger ecosystem, or causes damage or harm to shoreline ecological functions under foreseeable conditions; or scientific evidence indicates the action may contribute to damage or harm to ecological functions as part of cumulative impacts.

“Tideland” means the land on the shore of marine water bodies between ordinary high water mark or mean higher high water and the line of extreme low tide which is submerged daily by tides.

“Trail or shared use path” means a facility physically separated from motorized vehicular traffic to accommodate pedestrians, bicyclists and other nonmotorized vehicles. Such trails may be used for commuting and recreational purposes and may connect neighborhoods and other destinations.

“Transportation facilities” means streets, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks consistent with the City of University Place transportation design standards in Chapter 13.20 UPMC and the City of University Place design standards and guidelines for street-scape elements adopted by reference in Chapter 19.54 UPMC.

“Variance, shoreline” means a means to grant relief from specific bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in this Shoreline Program or related State regulations pursuant to the criteria of WAC 173-27-170; such may not vary a use of a shoreline.

“Vegetation conservation” includes activities to protect and restore vegetation along or near shorelines that minimize habitat loss and the impact of invasive plants, erosion and flooding, and contribute to ecological functions of shoreline areas. Vegetation conservation provisions include the prevention or restriction of plant clearing and earth grading, vegetation restoration, and the control of invasive weeds and nonnative species. Vegetation management provisions apply equally to those shorelines and uses that are exempt from a permit requirement.

“Vegetation, native” means plants commonly found in western Washington prior to European settlement; generally comprised of three vegetative levels including an overstory of trees, an understory of shrubs, and a floor of herbs.

“Vessel” means ships, boats, barges or any other floating craft that are designed and used for navigation and do not interfere with the normal public use of the water.

“Visual access” means access with improvements that provide a view of the shoreline or water but that do not allow physical access to the shoreline.

“Water-dependent use” means a use or portion of a use which cannot exist in a location that is not adjacent to the water and which is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations. Water-dependent uses may include, but are not limited to, ferry and passenger terminals, ship building and dry docking, marinas, boat ramps and transient moorage, and aquaculture.

“Water-enjoyment use” means a recreational use or other use that facilitates public access to the shoreline as a primary characteristic of the use; or a use that provides for recreational use or aesthetic enjoyment of the shoreline for a substantial number of people as a general characteristic of the use and which through location, design, and operation ensures the public’s ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline. In order to qualify as a water-enjoyment use, the use must be open to the general public and the shoreline-oriented space within the project must be devoted to the specific aspects of the use that fosters shoreline enjoyment. Primary water-enjoyment uses may include, but are not limited to, parks, piers, view towers, boardwalks, shared use paths and trails, interpretive centers and other improvements facilitating public access to shorelines of the State. General water-enjoyment uses may include but are not limited to restaurants, museums, aquariums, scientific/ecological reserves, golf courses, resorts and convention centers, and public markets; provided, that such uses conform to the above water-enjoyment specifications and the provisions of the Master Program.

“Water-oriented use” means a use that is water-dependent, water-related, or water-enjoyment, or a combination of such uses.

“Water-related use” means a use or portion of a use which is not intrinsically dependent on a waterfront location but whose economic viability is dependent upon a waterfront location because:

1. The use has a functional requirement for a waterfront location such as the arrival or shipment of materials by water or the need for large quantities of water; or

2. The use provides a necessary service supportive of the water-dependent uses and the proximity of the use to its customers makes its services less expensive and/or more convenient. Water-related uses may include, but are not limited to, professional services serving primarily water-dependent activities, warehousing of goods transported by water, watercraft sales, and boating supplies.

“Weir” means a device placed in a stream or river to raise or divert the water.

(Ord. 703 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).

18.15.010 General provisions.

A. To be authorized, all uses and development shall be carried out in a manner that is consistent with this Shoreline Program and the policies of the Shoreline Management Act as required by RCW 90.58.140(1), regardless of whether a substantial shoreline development permit, letter of exemption, shoreline variance, or shoreline conditional use permit is required.

B. No use, alteration, or development shall be undertaken within the shorelines regulated under this Shoreline Program by any person without first obtaining a permit or letter of exemption.

C. Applicants shall apply for a shoreline substantial development permit, variance, conditional use permit or letter of exemption on forms provided by the City.

D. The City shall process applications for a shoreline substantial development permit, shoreline variance, or shoreline conditional use permit in accordance with Chapter 22.05 UPMC. However, the public comment period established in UPMC 22.05.060(D)(1) shall not apply; the public comment period shall be 30 days. The time requirements in WAC 173-27-090 shall be applied to all permits issued or development authorized under this Shoreline Program.

E. When developing and adopting procedures for administrative interpretation of this Master Program, the City shall consult with the Department of Ecology to ensure that any formal written interpretations are consistent with the purpose and intent of the Act and the SMP Guidelines.

F. Permit revisions are required to comply with the revision approval criteria in WAC 173-27-100.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.020 Shoreline substantial development permits.

A. A shoreline substantial development permit shall be required for all proposed use and development of shorelines unless the proposal is specifically exempted in accordance with WAC 173-27-040.

B. In order to be approved, the Examiner shall find that the proposal is consistent with the following criteria:

1. All regulations of this Shoreline Program appropriate to the shoreline environment designation and the type of use or development proposed shall be met, except those bulk and dimensional standards that have been modified by approval of a shoreline variance.

2. All policies of this Shoreline Program appropriate to the shoreline environment designation and the type of use or development activity proposed shall be considered and compliance demonstrated.

C. Consideration shall be given to the cumulative environmental impact of additional requests for like actions in the vicinity of the project site. For example, if shoreline substantial development permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the sum of the authorized actions should also remain consistent with the policy of RCW 90.58.020 and should not produce significant adverse effects to the shoreline ecological functions and processes or other users.

D. The City is the final authority for a shoreline substantial development permit, unless an appeal is filed with the State Shorelines Hearings Board.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.030 Exemptions from shoreline substantial development permit.

A. Certain developments are exempt from the requirement to obtain a substantial development permit. Developments that are exempt from the requirement for a substantial development permit are identified in WAC 173-27-040, RCW

90.58.147, and the definition of exempt development in UPMC 18.10.020.

1. Exemptions shall be construed narrowly. Only those developments that meet the precise terms of one or more of the listed exemptions may be granted exemption from the substantial development permit process.

2. An exemption from the substantial development permit process is not an exemption from compliance with the Act or this Shoreline Program, or from any other regulatory requirements. To be authorized, all uses and developments must be consistent with the policies and provisions of this Shoreline Program and the Act. A development or use that is listed as a conditional use pursuant to this Shoreline Program, or is an unlisted use, must obtain a conditional use permit even though the development or use does not require a substantial development permit. When a development or use is proposed that does not comply with the bulk, dimensional and performance standards of this Shoreline Program, such development or use can only be authorized by approval of a variance.

3. The burden of proof that a development or use is exempt from the permit process is on the applicant.

4. If any part of a proposed development is not eligible for exemption, then a substantial development permit is required for the entire proposed development project.

5. The Administrator may attach conditions to the approval of exempted developments and/or uses as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Act and this Shoreline Program.

6. A use or activity that is exempt from the critical area review process under UPMC Title 17 is not automatically exempt from the requirements of this Shoreline Program. Such use or activity is exempt from a requirement to obtain a shoreline substantial development permit only if explicitly named under WAC 173-27-040.

B. Letter of Exemption.

1. Exempt activities related to any of the following shall not be conducted until a letter of exemption has been obtained from the Administrator: dredging, flood control works, in-water structures, archaeological or historic site alteration, clearing and ground disturbing activities such as filling and excavation, docks, shore stabilization, or activities determined to be located within a critical area or buffer.

2. Other activities identified in WAC 173-27-040, RCW 90.58.147, and the definition of exempt development in UPMC 18.10.020 that do not involve one of the activities specified in subsection (B)(1) of this section may be undertaken without a letter of exemption; provided, that advance notification of the action has been provided to the City. If the Administrator determines that the activity presents a substantial risk to cause detrimental impacts to shoreline functions, or that the activity requires a letter of exemption under subsection (B)(1) of this section, a letter of exemption may be required.

3. A letter of exemption shall expire one year after the date of issuance unless otherwise specified in the letter of exemption. The same measures used to calculate time periods for shoreline permits as set forth in WAC 173-27-090(3) shall be used for letters of exemption.

4. A letter of exemption is not required for emergency development pursuant to WAC 173-27-040(2)(d).

5. A notice of decision for a letter of exemption shall be provided to the applicant/proponent and any party of record. Such notices shall also be filed with the Department of Ecology, pursuant to the requirements of WAC 173-27-050, when the project is subject to one or more of the following Federal permitting requirements:

a. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 10 permit under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; or

b. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permit under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972.

6. All applications for a letter of exemption shall provide, at a minimum, a Joint Aquatic Resource Permit Application (JARPA). Applicants may use the JARPA process to apply for, at one time, any or all of the permits below:

Federal

• U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps): Section 10 and Section 404 (Corps Permits FAQ).

• U.S. Coast Guard: General Bridge Permit and Private Aids to Navigation (PATON).

State

• Washington Department of Ecology: 401 Water Quality Certification.

• Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife: Hydraulic Project Approval (HPA FAQ).

• Washington Department of Natural Resources: Aquatic Use Authorization.

Local

• Shoreline Substantial Development Permit.

• Shoreline Conditional Use Permit.

• Shoreline Variance.

• Shoreline Exemption.

• Shoreline Revision.

Information shall be provided that is sufficient for the Administrator to determine if the proposal will comply with the requirements of this Shoreline Program.

7. A denial of an exemption shall be in writing and shall identify the reason(s) for the denial. The Administrator’s decision on a statement of exemption is subject to administrative appeal.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.040 Shoreline conditional use permits.

A. The purpose of a shoreline conditional use permit is to allow a case-by-case review of certain uses which may have a greater potential for impacts without project-specific conditions. In authorizing a shoreline conditional use permit, special conditions may be attached by the City or the Department of Ecology to prevent any undesirable effects of the proposed use and/or to assure consistency of the project with the Act and this Shoreline Program.

B. When a conditional use is requested, the Examiner shall be the final approval authority for the City. However, shoreline conditional uses must have approval from the State. The Department of Ecology shall be the final approval authority under the authority of WAC 173-27-200.

C. Uses which are classified in this Shoreline Program as conditional uses may be authorized; provided, that the applicant can satisfy all of the criteria set forth in WAC 173-27-160:

1. That the proposed use will be consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the Shoreline Program;

2. That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines;

3. That the proposed use of the site and design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the Comprehensive Plan and Shoreline Program;

4. That the proposed use will cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; and

5. That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect.

D. Consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if shoreline conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment. Other uses that are not specifically classified as a permitted or conditional use in this Shoreline Program may be authorized as a conditional use; provided, that the applicant can satisfy the criteria set forth in WAC 173-27-160 (see subsection (C) of this section) and this Shoreline Program.

E. Uses that are specifically prohibited by this Shoreline Program shall not be authorized as conditional uses.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.050 Shoreline variances.

A. The purpose of a shoreline variance is strictly limited to granting relief from specific bulk, dimensional, or performance standards set forth in this Shoreline Program where there are extraordinary circumstances relating to the physical character or configuration of property such that the strict implementation of this Shoreline Program will impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the policies set forth in RCW 90.58.020.

B. When a shoreline variance permit is requested, the Examiner shall be the City’s final approval authority. However, shoreline variances must have approval from the State. The Department of Ecology shall be the final approval authority under the authority of WAC 173-27-200.

C. Shoreline variances should be granted in circumstances where denial of the variance would result in a thwarting of the policy enumerated in RCW 90.58.020. In all instances the applicant must demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances shall be shown and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

D. Variances from the use regulations of this Shoreline Program are prohibited.

E. Land shall not be subdivided to create parcels that are buildable only with a shoreline variance or would be considered nonconforming.

F. Variances for development and/or uses that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark and/or landward of any wetland may be authorized, provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

1. That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in this Shoreline Program precludes, or significantly interferes with, reasonable use of the property;

2. That the hardship described above is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and the application of the Shoreline Program;

3. That the design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the Comprehensive Plan and Shoreline Program and will not cause adverse impacts to the shoreline environment;

4. That the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by other properties in the area;

5. That the variance request is the minimum necessary to afford relief;

6. That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect; and

7. That the need for the variance is not the result of deed restrictions or deliberate actions of the applicant or property owner.

G. Variances for development and/or uses that will be located waterward of the ordinary high water mark or within any wetland may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

1. That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in this Shoreline Program precludes all reasonable use of the property not otherwise prohibited by this Shoreline Program;

2. That the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsection (F) of this section; and

3. That the public rights of navigation and use of the shoreline will not be adversely affected.

H. In the granting of all shoreline variances, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.060 Unclassified uses.

A. Other uses not specifically classified or set forth in this Shoreline Program, including the expansion or resumption of a nonconforming use, may be authorized as shoreline conditional uses, provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

1. The proposal will satisfy the shoreline conditional use permit criteria set forth in UPMC 18.15.040(C);

2. The use clearly requires a specific site location on the shoreline not provided for under this Shoreline Program;

3. Extraordinary circumstances preclude reasonable use of the property in a manner consistent with the use regulations of this Shoreline Program; and

4. The use is not a residential dwelling unit or other residential use.

B. Uses that are specifically prohibited in this Shoreline Program cannot be authorized by a shoreline conditional use permit.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.070 Nonconforming development.

A. General Provisions. Uses, lots or structures within the shoreline jurisdiction that do not meet the specific standards of this Shoreline Program shall be regulated pursuant to Chapter 19.80 UPMC, Nonconforming Lots, Uses, and Structures.

B. Continuance. Subject to the provisions of this Shoreline Program, a lot, use or structure lawfully existing prior to the effective date of this Program or any amendment thereto, which is rendered nonconforming by adoption of this Shoreline Program or an amendment, may continue in the manner and to the extent that it existed upon the effective date of this Shoreline Program or amendment, respectively.

C. Nonconforming Development Regulations.

1. Nonconforming lots, uses and structures shall be regulated in accordance with Chapter 19.80 UPMC. In addition to provisions contained therein, the following provisions shall apply within the shoreline jurisdiction:

a. Any actions taken under the provisions of Chapter 19.80 UPMC shall not create adverse impacts to shoreline ecological functions and processes, and shall consider the cumulative impacts associated with the proposed action;

b. Required vegetation conservation areas are provided pursuant to UPMC 18.25.100;

c. Expansion of a nonconforming structure within the required shoreline setback, whether horizontally or vertically, shall be prohibited;

d. The Administrator may authorize expansion of a nonconforming structure, provided:

(1) The expansion is located entirely outside of the VCA, VCA setback, and shoreline setback;

(2) The expansion is consistent with all other provisions of this Shoreline Program; and

(3) The expansion does not increase the degree of nonconformity. If the expansion would comply with subsections (C)(1)(d)(1) and (C)(1)(d)(2) of this section but increase the degree of zoning nonconformity, a variance would be required pursuant to UPMC 19.80.050(A)(1). This provision could apply, for example, to a proposal with a front yard setback that complies with all Shoreline Program requirements but requires a zoning variance;

e. Notwithstanding UPMC 19.80.050(A)(2), the Administrator may authorize relocation of a nonconforming structure, provided the structure is brought as closely as practicable into conformance with the applicable provisions of this Shoreline Program;

f. An expanded or relocated structure for which an administrative authorization has been issued consistent with the criteria listed in subsection (C)(1)(d) or (e) of this section shall be considered a legal nonconforming structure and the requirements of this section shall apply as they apply to preexisting nonconforming structures;

g. A nonconforming use may not be converted to a use that is specifically prohibited in this Shoreline Program; and

h. The applicant shall obtain required shoreline permits or approvals prior to construction.

2. Existing nonconforming covered moorage may be maintained, repaired, or replaced in accordance with WAC 173-27-040 and the requirements of the Department of Natural Resources.

3. The expansion of a nonconforming use may be authorized as a shoreline conditional use, provided the applicant demonstrates compliance with the standards in UPMC 18.15.060(A).

4. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months or for 12 months during any two-year period, the nonconforming rights shall expire and any subsequent use shall be conforming unless reestablishment of the use is authorized through a shoreline conditional use permit, provided the applicant demonstrates compliance with the standards in UPMC 18.15.060(A) and the permit is applied for within the two-year period. Water-dependent uses should not be considered discontinued when they are inactive due to dormancy, or where the use includes phased or rotational operations as part of typical operations. 

D. Existing, lawfully established single-family residences on Day Island, Day Island South Spit and Sunset Beach located closer to the ordinary high water mark than the setback specified in Table 18.30.B shall be considered conforming structures for purposes of this SMP. Such structures may be expanded in accordance with footnotes 30 and 31 on Table 18.30.B, and shall be subject to the substantial destruction provisions in UPMC 19.80.050(A)(4) and (5).

E. Procedure for Development of a Nonconforming Lot.

1. When lot size would prevent development of a nonconforming lot consistent with the applicable shoreline setback requirements, the Examiner may authorize development under the following conditions:

a. A written request for a shoreline variance is received from the project proponent;

b. The development will be located as far landward as possible from the ordinary high water mark; and

c. The decision of the Examiner shall be based upon the shoreline variance criteria found in UPMC 18.15.050(F).

(Ord. 703 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.080 Submittal requirements.

A. All development proposals under the jurisdiction of this Shoreline Program shall satisfy the application submittal requirements set forth in UPMC Titles 19, Zoning; 21, Subdivision Regulations; and 22, Administration of Development Regulations, including the submittal of forms provided by the City and the payment of fees in accordance with the current fee schedule adopted by Council resolution. A complete application for a shoreline substantial development permit, shoreline conditional use permit, or shoreline variance permit shall contain, at a minimum, the information contained in WAC 173-27-180.

B. The Administrator may accept a Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA) in lieu of the submittal requirements in subsection (A) of this section, where applicable.

C. The Administrator may waive permit submittal requirements on a case-by-case basis and may request additional information, as necessary.

D. In addition to the submittal requirements in subsection (A) of this section, development proposals on shoreline parcels that are located within critical areas and/or their buffers shall submit critical area reports and plans as required in UPMC Title 17, Division 1.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.090 Ecology review.

A. The Department of Ecology shall be notified of any substantial development, conditional use or variance permit decision made by the Examiner or Administrator, whether it is an approval or denial. The notification shall occur concurrently with the transmittal of the ruling to the applicant. When a substantial development permit and either conditional use or variance permit are required for a development, the submittal of the permits shall be made concurrently. After all local permit administrative appeals or reconsideration periods are complete and the permit documents are amended to incorporate any resulting changes, the Administrator shall mail the permit and the following items using return receipt requested mail to the Department of Ecology and the Office of the Attorney General:

1. A copy of the complete application per WAC 173-27-180;

2. Findings and conclusions that establish the basis for the decision, including but not limited to identification of shoreline environment designation, applicable Shoreline Program policies and regulations and the consistency of the project with appropriate review criteria for the type of permit(s);

3. The final decision of the City;

4. The permit data sheet per WAC 173-27-190;

5. Affidavit of public notice; and

6. Where applicable, the Administrator shall also file the applicable documents required by the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW).

B. When the project has been modified in the course of the local review process, plans or text shall be provided to Ecology that clearly indicates the final approved plan.

C. If Ecology determines that the submittal does not contain all of the documents and information required by this section, Ecology shall identify the deficiencies and notify the City and the applicant in writing. Ecology will not act on conditional use or variance permit submittals until the material requested in writing is submitted to them.

D. Ecology shall convey to the City and applicant its final decision approving, approving with conditions, or disapproving the permit within 30 days of the date of submittal by the City. The Administrator will notify those interested persons having requested notification of such decision.

E. Ecology shall base its determination to approve, approve with conditions or deny a conditional use permit or variance permit on consistency with the policy and provisions of the SMA, the criteria listed in Chapter 173-27 WAC and this Shoreline Program.

F. Consistent with RCW 90.58.140(6), the State’s Shoreline Hearings Board 21-day appeal period starts with the date of filing, which is defined below:

1. For projects that only require a substantial development permit: the date that Ecology receives the City’s decision.

2. For a conditional use permit or variance: the date that Ecology’s decision on the conditional use permit or variance is transmitted to the applicant and City.

3. For substantial development permits simultaneously mailed with a conditional use permit or variance to Ecology: the date that Ecology’s decision on the conditional use permit or variance is transmitted to the applicant and the City.

G. No construction pursuant to a shoreline substantial development permit, shoreline variance, or shoreline conditional use authorized by this Shoreline Program shall begin or be authorized, and no building, grading or other construction permits shall be issued by the City, until 21 days from the date of filing or until all review proceedings are terminated.

(Ord. 703 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.100 Inspections.

Pursuant to RCW 90.58.200, the Administrator or authorized representatives may enter land or structures to enforce the provisions of this Shoreline Program.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A). 2015).


18.15.110 Penalties and enforcement.

A. The Shoreline Management Act imposes significant penalties for violation of the Act, regulations and master programs. A violation constitutes a gross misdemeanor, which is punishable by fine or imprisonment. In addition to the criminal penalty, the Act imposes liability on any person violating the Act or conditions of a permit for all damage to public or private property arising from the violation. Furthermore, the violator may have to restore an area affected by a violation, and pay the entire cost of restoration, including attorney’s fees and court costs.

B. Enforcement action may be taken by the City or Department of Ecology whenever a person has violated any provision of the Shoreline Management Act or this Shoreline Program or other regulation promulgated under the Act. Enforcement action by the City shall be in accordance with Chapters 1.20 and/or 1.30 UPMC for enforcement procedures and penalties.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.120 Master program review.

A. This Shoreline Program shall be reviewed periodically and amendments shall be made as are necessary to reflect changing local circumstances, new information or improved data, and changes in State statutes and regulations.

B. The City’s established permit tracking system, aerial photos, reviewing of other available data, and field observations as feasible shall be used to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of this Shoreline Program in achieving no net loss of shoreline ecological functions with respect to both permitting and exemptions.

C. As part of any required SMP update, an evaluation report assessing the cumulative effects of development on shoreline conditions and the effectiveness of this Shoreline Program in achieving no net loss shall be prepared and considered in determining whether policies and regulations are adequate in achieving this requirement.

D. The Shoreline Program review and update process shall be consistent with the requirements of Chapter 173-26 WAC or its successor and shall include a local citizen involvement effort and public hearing to obtain the views and comments of the public.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.15.130 Developments not required to obtain shoreline permits or local reviews.

Requirements to obtain a shoreline substantial development permit, conditional use permit, variance, letter of exemption, or other review to implement the Shoreline Management Act do not apply to the following:

A. Remedial Actions. Pursuant to RCW 90.58.355, any person conducting a remedial action at a facility pursuant to a consent decree, order, or agreed order issued pursuant to Chapter 70.105D RCW, or to the Department of Ecology when it conducts a remedial action under Chapter 70.105D RCW;

B. Boatyard Improvements to Meet NPDES Permit Requirements. Pursuant to RCW 90.58.355, any person installing site improvements for storm water treatment in an existing boatyard facility to meet requirements of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System storm water general permit;

18.20.010 Shoreline jurisdiction.

A. The provisions of the Shoreline Program shall apply to all shorelines of the State, all shorelines of Statewide significance and shorelands as defined in RCW 90.58.030 and this Shoreline Program. These areas are collectively referred to herein as “shorelines.”

B. The City shall have authority over those shorelines that meet the criteria of RCW 90.58.030 for “shorelines of the State” within its municipal boundaries, and where such boundary or any part thereof is adjacent to or fronting on any bays, lakes, sounds, rivers, or other navigable waters, the powers and jurisdiction of the City are hereby extended into and over such waters and over any tidelands intervening between any such boundary and any such waters to the middle of such bays, sounds, lakes, rivers, or other waters in every manner and for every purpose that such powers and jurisdiction could be exercised if the waters were within the City limits.

C. “Shorelines of the State” are the total of all “shorelines” and “shorelines of Statewide significance” within the State. Within University Place, this includes:

1. Marine Waters.

a. Those waters of Puget Sound lying between extreme low tide and the ordinary high water mark, and adjacent marine shorelands.

b. Chambers Bay Estuary and its associated wetlands, floodway and shorelands.

2. Streams.

a. Chambers Creek and its associated wetlands, floodway and shorelands.

3. Shorelines of Statewide Significance.

a. Those waters of Puget Sound lying seaward of extreme low tide.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.20.020 Official shoreline map.

A. Shoreline Environment Designations have been established and are delineated on the “City of University Place Shoreline Map” (Shoreline



Map) hereby incorporated as a part of this Shoreline Program. The official copy of this map shall reside with the Washington State Department of Ecology. Additional copies are available at the City of University Place Planning and Development Services Department for public use.

B. The Shoreline Map identifies shoreline environment designations and the approximate extent of shoreline jurisdiction within City boundaries. The map depicts, at a generalized level, the lateral extent of shoreline jurisdiction or associated wetlands and floodplains. The precise lateral extent of shoreline jurisdiction shall be determined on a case-by-case basis at the time a shoreline development is proposed. The actual extent of shoreline jurisdiction requires a site-specific evaluation to identify the location of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) and associated wetlands and/or floodplains.

C. Where uncertainty or conflict occurs in the exact location of a shoreline designation boundary, the Administrator shall interpret the boundaries based upon:

1. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot, tract, or section line shall be so construed;

2. Boundaries indicated as approximately following roads or railways shall be construed to follow their centerlines; or

3. Boundaries indicated as approximately parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsection (C)(1) or (2) of this section shall be so construed.

D. Whenever existing physical features are inconsistent with boundaries on the Shoreline Map, the Administrator shall interpret the boundaries, with deference to actual conditions. Appeals of such interpretations may be filed pursuant to the applicable appeal procedures described in Chapter 22.10 UPMC.

E. In the event of a mapping error, the City will rely upon common boundary descriptions and the criteria contained in RCW 90.58.030(2) and Chapter 173-22 WAC pertaining to determinations of shorelands, as amended, rather than the incorrect or outdated map.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.20.030 Shoreline environment designations.

This section sets forth the purpose, designation criteria, and management policies for the five shoreline environment designations established in this Shoreline Program. Areas within shoreline jurisdiction that are not mapped and/or designated are automatically assigned an Urban Conservancy environment designation until the shoreline can be re-designated through a Shoreline Master Program amendment. General boundaries for each shoreline environment are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, and summarized, below:

Marine Deepwater: Areas waterward of the intertidal shorelines of Puget Sound delineated by the - 10 MLLW line;

Natural: Water portions of Chambers Creek extending to the centerline and shorelands located east of the Section 28/Section 29 line, Township 20 North, Range 2 East, excluding Kobayashi Park;

Urban Conservancy: Kobayashi Park, those portions of Chambers Creek Properties abutting the Chambers Bay estuary and Puget Sound, the BNSF ROW, and residential properties abutting the BNSF ROW located adjacent to Puget Sound. Also, aquatic zones on that portion of Chambers Creek to the center line fronting Kobayashi Park; aquatic zones on the Chambers Creek properties, BNSF ROW and residential properties fronting the ROW; and the waters to the middle of Chambers Bay and to the -10 MLLW line along Puget Sound.

Shoreline Residential: Day Island and Sunset Beach residential neighborhoods and those lands/waters extending out to the -10 MLLW line and the center of the Day Island waterway; and

Day Island Medium Intensity: Existing marinas, mixed use and yacht club properties abutting the Day Island waterway and those lands/waters extending out to the -10 MLLW line and the center of the Day Island waterway.

A. Marine Deepwater Environment.

1. Purpose. The purpose of the Marine Deepwater environment is to protect and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas waterward of the intertidal shoreline. Although not a WAC designated environment designation, the Marine Deepwater environment has been established by the City to address concerns with activities that are anticipated to occur only in deep water marine areas such as dredge and mooring buoys.

2. Designation Criteria. The Marine Deepwater Environment shall apply to all marine waters and underlying submerged lands between the -10-foot MLLW line and the center of the waterway.

3. Management Policies. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the following management policies shall apply:

a. All developments and uses on navigable waters and submerged lands should be located and designed to minimize interference with surface navigation, to reduce impacts to public views, and to allow for the safe, unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife, particularly those species dependent on migration.

b. Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical saltwater habitats should not be authorized except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020, and then only when all potential impacts are mitigated as necessary to assure maintenance of shoreline ecological functions and processes.

c. Shoreline uses and modifications should be designed and managed to prevent degradation of water quality and alteration of natural conditions. New over-water structures should only be authorized for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration. The size of new over-water structures should be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structure’s intended use. To reduce the impacts of shoreline development and increase effective use of water resources, multiple uses of the same over-water facility should be encouraged.

B. Natural Environment.

1. Purpose. The purpose of the Natural environment is to protect those shoreline areas, specifically associated with Chambers Creek, that are relatively free of human influence or that include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions intolerant of human use. These systems require that only very low-intensity uses be allowed in order to maintain the ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes. Consistent with the policies of the designation, the City should include planning for restoration of degraded shorelines within this environment.

2. Designation Criteria. The Natural environment designation shall be assigned to shoreline areas if any of the following characteristics apply:

a. The shoreline is ecologically intact and therefore currently performing an important, irreplaceable function or ecosystem-wide process that would be damaged by human activity.

b. The shoreline is considered to represent ecosystems and geologic types that are of particular scientific and educational interest; or

c. The shoreline is unable to support new development or uses without significant adverse impacts to ecological functions or risk to human safety.

3. Management Policies. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the following management policies shall apply:

a. Any use or modification that would substantially degrade the ecological functions or natural character of the Chambers Creek shoreline area should not be allowed.

b. Non-water-oriented uses shall be highly restricted and generally limited to low-intensity, passive uses subject to conditional use permit approval.

c. New single-family residential development may be allowed as a conditional use within the natural environment if the development is located outside of the vegetation conservation area and if the density and intensity of such use is limited as necessary to protect ecological functions and be consistent with the purpose of the environment.

d. Structures, parking areas and associated infrastructure should be located outside of shoreline jurisdiction unless there is no practicable alternative.

e. Scientific, historical, cultural, educational research uses, walking/hiking trails, and low-intensity water-oriented recreational access uses may be allowed; provided, that no significant ecological impact on the area will result.

f. New development or significant vegetation removal that would reduce the capability of vegetation to perform normal ecological functions should not be allowed. The subdivision of property should not be allowed when the configuration will require significant vegetation removal or shoreline modification that adversely impacts ecological functions. Each new parcel must be able to support its intended development without significant ecological impacts to the shoreline function.

4. Management Policies – Aquatic Zone. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the following management policies shall apply to areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark:

a. All developments and uses on the waters of Chambers Creek should be located and designed to reduce impacts to public views and to allow for the safe, unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife, particularly those species dependent on migration.

b. Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of habitats associated with Chambers Creek should not be authorized except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020, and then only when all potential impacts are mitigated as necessary to assure maintenance of shoreline ecological functions and processes.

c. Shoreline uses and modifications should be designed and managed to prevent degradation of water quality and alteration of natural conditions. New over-water structures should only be authorized for public access or ecological restoration. The size of new over-water structures should be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structure’s intended use.

C. Urban Conservancy Environment.

1. Purpose. The purpose of the Urban Conservancy environment is to protect and restore ecological functions of open space, flood plain and other sensitive lands where they exist in urban and developed settings, while allowing a variety of compatible uses including residential development. An additional purpose is to protect, restore and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas between the ordinary high water mark and the -10-foot MLLW line adjacent to upland Urban Conservancy areas.

2. Designation Criteria. The Urban Conservancy environment designation shall be applied to shoreline areas appropriate and planned for development that is compatible with maintaining or restoring of the ecological functions of the area, which are not generally suitable for water-dependent uses, if any of the following characteristics apply:

a. Shoreline areas are suitable for water-related or water-enjoyment uses.

b. Shoreline areas are open space, flood plain or other sensitive areas that should not be more intensively developed.

c. Shoreline areas have potential for ecological restoration.

d. Shoreline areas retain important ecological functions, even though partially developed; or

e. Shoreline areas have the potential for development that is compatible with ecological restoration.

3. Management Policies. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the following management policies shall apply:

a. Uses that preserve the natural character of the area or promote preservation of open space, floodplain or critical areas either directly or over the long term should be the primary allowed uses. Where lawfully established residential structures exist within shoreline jurisdiction, residential uses and activities that are compatible with the purpose of the Urban Conservancy Environment and do not result in significant impacts to ecological functions may be considered a primary allowed use. Uses that result in the restoration of ecological functions should be allowed if the use is otherwise compatible with the purpose of the Urban Conservancy environment and the physical characteristics of the setting.

b. Buffers, shoreline stabilization limitations, water quality measures, and vegetation conservation or enhancement measures should be used to regulate and inform the design of the proposed use or development and ensure that it does not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or degrade other shoreline values.

c. Public access, including walking/hiking trails, should be provided whenever feasible and significant ecological impacts can be avoided or mitigated.

d. A variety of recreational uses as established by the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Code, Chambers Creek Properties Master Site Plan and this Shoreline Program, should be allowed where the development of such uses is done in a manner that protects or enhances shoreline ecological functions.

e. Water-oriented uses should be given priority over non-water-oriented uses.

f. New over-water structures should be prohibited except for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration.

g. The size of new over-water structures should be the minimum necessary to support the structure’s intended use.

h. Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical saltwater habitats should not be authorized except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020, and then only when all potential impacts are mitigated as necessary to assure maintenance of shoreline ecological functions and processes.

i. Residential uses that preserve the natural character of the area, maintain shoreline vegetation buffers and/or promote preservation of open space, floodplains or sensitive lands, either directly or over the long term, should be allowed. Residential development should be authorized only:

(1) When adequate setbacks or buffers are provided to protect shoreline ecological functions;

(2) Where there is adequate access, infrastructure and public services; and

(3) Where the environment can support the proposed use or development in a manner which protects, enhances, or restores ecological functions.

j. The rights of navigation should be protected.

4. Management Policies – Aquatic Zone. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the management policies in UPMC 18.20.030(A)(3) shall apply to areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

D. Shoreline Residential Environment.

1. Purpose. The purpose of the Shoreline Residential environment is to accommodate residential development and appurtenant structures that are consistent with this Shoreline Program. Additional purposes are to provide public access and recreational uses, and to protect, restore and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas between the ordinary high water mark and the -10-foot MLLW line adjacent to upland Shoreline Residential areas.

2. Designation Criteria. The Shoreline Residential environment designation shall be applied to shoreline areas if they are predominantly single-family or multifamily residential development or are planned and platted for residential development.

3. Management Policies. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the following management policies shall apply:

a. Land division and development should be authorized only:

(1) When adequate setbacks or buffers are provided to protect shoreline ecological functions;

(2) Where there is adequate access, infrastructure and public services; and

(3) Where the environment can support the proposed use or development in a manner which protects, enhances, or restores ecological functions.

b. Multifamily residential development and subdivisions of land into more than four parcels should provide public access to the shoreline and joint use for recreational facilities.

c. Development (including expansion of existing structures) should be located and designed so that shoreline stabilization is not needed, to the extent practicable, either at the time of development/expansion or in the future.

d. Vegetation conservation measures should be utilized for new development and expansions to existing structures to protect, enhance or restore shoreline areas.

e. Water-oriented recreational uses should be allowed.

f. New over-water structures should be prohibited except for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration.

g. The size of new over-water structures should be the minimum necessary to support the structure’s intended use.

h. In order to reduce the impacts of shoreline development and increase effective use of water resources, multiple use of over-water facilities should be encouraged.

i. Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical saltwater habitats should not be authorized except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020, and then only when all potential impacts are mitigated as necessary to assure maintenance of shoreline ecological functions and processes.

4. Management Policies – Aquatic Zone. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the management policies in UPMC 18.20.030(A)(3) shall apply to areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

E. Day Island Medium Intensity Environment.

1. Purpose. The purpose of the Day Island Medium Intensity environment is to accommodate marinas, yacht clubs with boat moorage and related facilities and activities, water-oriented commercial, transportation and light industrial uses, and moderate density residential uses within mixed use projects, while protecting existing ecological functions and restoring ecological functions in areas that have been previously degraded. Additional purposes are to provide public access to the shoreline and recreational uses oriented toward the waterfront, to accommodate non-water-oriented uses on a limited basis where appropriate, and to protect, restore and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas between the ordinary high water mark and the -10-foot MLLW line. The intent of the Day Island Medium Intensity environment is similar to that of a High Intensity Environment as described in WAC 173-26-211 except that development intensities are to be limited to those consistent with the Comprehensive Plan designation and zoning classification for the area.

2. Designation Criteria. The Day Island Medium Intensity environment shall be assigned to shoreline areas that currently support a mix of uses related to commerce, industry, transportation or navigation, recreation, and moderate density housing; or are suitable and planned for medium- intensity water-oriented uses.

3. Management Policies. In addition to the other applicable policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program, the following management policies shall apply:

a. The shoreline abutting the Day Island Lagoon is characterized by a variety of urban uses and activities, including commercial, light industrial, marina, residential, and recreational uses. Together, these uses and activities have the potential to create a vibrant shoreline that is consistent with and supportive of University Place’s character and quality of life. These types of uses should be allowed within the Day Island Medium Intensity environment, with preference given to water-oriented uses.

b. Non-water-oriented uses should not be allowed except as part of mixed use development that is predominantly water-oriented in terms of use.

c. The redevelopment and renewal of substandard and degraded shoreline areas should be encouraged. Future development of these areas should include restoration and/or enhancement of degraded shorelines and the provision of public access to the shoreline.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.030 Flood hazard reduction.

A. Applicability. The following provisions apply to actions taken to reduce flood damage or hazard and to uses, development, and shoreline modifications that could increase flood hazards. Flood hazard reduction measures can consist of nonstructural measures such as setbacks, land use controls, wetland restoration, relocation of uses, biotechnical measures, or stormwater management programs, and structural controls such as dikes, levees, revetments, bulkheads, floodwalls, channel realignment, or elevation of structures consistent with the National Flood Insurance Program.

B. Policies.

1. Where feasible, nonstructural flood hazard reduction measures should be given preference over structural measures.

2. Flood hazard reduction provisions should be based on applicable watershed management plans, comprehensive flood hazard management plans, and other comprehensive planning efforts, provided those measures are consistent with the SMA and this Shoreline Program.

3. Flood hazard reduction measures should not result in a net loss of ecological functions.

4. When evaluating flood control measures, the removal or relocation of structures in flood- prone areas should be considered.

5. Development and shoreline modifications that would result in interference with the process of channel migration and may impact property or improvements or result in a net loss of ecological functions should not be allowed.

C. Regulations.

1. New development or new uses in shoreline jurisdiction, including subdivision of land, shall not be established when it would be reasonably foreseeable that the development or use would require structural flood hazard reduction measures within the channel migration zone or floodway.

2. New structural flood hazard reduction measures in the shoreline jurisdiction shall be allowed only when it can be demonstrated by a scientific and engineering analysis that they are necessary to protect existing development, that nonstructural measures are not feasible, that impacts on ecological functions and priority species and habitats can be successfully mitigated so as to assure no net loss, and that appropriate vegetation conservation actions are undertaken consistent with WAC 173-26-221(5) and this Shoreline Program.

3. New structural flood hazard reduction measures shall be placed landward of the associated wetlands, and designated vegetation conservation areas, except for actions that increase ecological functions, such as wetland restoration. In order for such flood hazard reduction projects to be authorized, it must be determined that no other alternative is feasible to protect existing development. The need for and analysis of feasible alternatives to structural improvements shall be documented through a geotechnical analysis.

4. New structural public flood hazard reduction measures, such as dikes and levees, shall dedicate and improve public access pathways unless public access improvements would cause unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public, inherent and unavoidable security problems, unacceptable and unmitigable significant ecological impacts, unavoidable conflict with the proposed use, or a cost that is disproportionate and unreasonable to the total long-term cost of the development.

5. New development within a channel migration zone or floodway shall be limited to the uses and activities listed in WAC 173-26-221(3)(b) and (3)(c)(i). Removal of gravel for flood management purposes shall be consistent with an adopted flood hazard reduction plan and allowed only after a biological and geomorphological study shows that extraction has a long-term benefit to flood hazard reduction, does not result in a net loss of ecological functions, and is part of a comprehensive flood management solution.

6. The City’s flood damage prevention regulations, codified under UPMC Title 14, apply to areas of special flood hazards in the shoreline jurisdiction. Chapter 14.15 UPMC is herein incorporated into this SMP, except for the variance provisions contained in UPMC 14.15.030(D).

A. Intent and Applicability. Shoreline public access is the physical ability of the general public to reach and touch the water’s edge or the ability to have a view of the water and the shoreline from upland locations. There are a variety of types of public access, including docks and piers, boat launches, pathways and trails, promenades, street ends, picnic areas, beach walks, viewpoints and others. An important goal of the Shoreline Management Act is to protect and enhance public access to the State’s shorelines. The public’s ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the State is to be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the State and its citizens. Alterations of the natural conditions of the shorelines of the State, in those limited instances when authorized, shall be given priority for development that will provide an opportunity for substantial numbers of people to enjoy these shorelines.

Public access and use of the shoreline is supported, in part, by the Public Trust Doctrine. The essence of the doctrine is that the waters of the State are a public resource owned by and available to all citizens equally for the purposes of navigation, conducting commerce, fishing, recreation and similar uses, and that this trust is not invalidated by private ownership of the underlying land. The doctrine limits public and private use of tidelands and other shorelands to protect the public’s right to use the waters of the State. The Public Trust Doctrine does not allow the public to trespass over privately owned uplands to access the tidelands. It does, however, protect public use of navigable waterbodies.

Standards for the dedication and improvement of public access, as noted in the SMP guidelines found in WAC 173-26-221(4)(d)(iii), apply in shoreline jurisdiction as provided in this section.

B. General Policies.

1. Developments, uses, and activities should be designed and operated to avoid or minimize blocking, reducing, or adversely interfering with the public’s visual or physical access to the water and the shorelines.

2. Public access should be a primary use in its own right or a secondary use that is created or enhanced as development or redevelopment occurs; provided, that private property rights and public safety are protected. Public access elements may include, but should not be limited to, the following:

a. Bicycle and other shared use pathways along or adjacent to the shoreline;

b. Shoreline parks;

c. Beach areas;

d. Piers, wharves, docks, and floats;

e. Transient moorage;

f. Trails, promenades, boardwalks, pedestrian overpasses or underpasses over or under the railroad ROW, or other pedestrian ways along or adjacent to the shoreline edge.

3. New development should avoid or minimize conflict with existing public access or planned public access projects and provide mitigation if impacts cannot be avoided.

4. Impacts to public access from new development should be mitigated through the provision of on-site visual and physical public access, unless such access is shown to be incompatible due to reasons of safety, security, or impact to the shoreline.

5. Development projects on public property or proposed by public entities should be required to incorporate public access features except where access is incompatible with safety, security, or environmental protection.

6. Public access provisions should be consistent with all relevant constitutional and other limitations that apply to regulations that are placed on private property, including the nexus and proportionality requirements.

7. Public access requirements on privately owned lands should be commensurate with the scale of the development and should be reasonable, effective and fair to all affected parties including but not limited to the landowner and the public.

8. Public access should not compromise, in any significant manner, the rights of navigation and space necessary for water-dependent uses to prevail.

9. Where maintenance of views from adjacent properties and water-dependent uses or physical public access conflict, water-dependent uses and physical public access should prevail.

10. The City should continue working with private property owners, the City of Lakewood and Pierce County to develop shoreline trail systems and other means of shoreline access in accordance with the Chambers Creek Properties Master Site Plan and the City’s Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan.

11. Shoreline access improvements within the Chambers Creek Properties should be developed in accordance with the Chambers Creek Properties Master Site Plan.

C. Access Preferences and Alternatives Policies.

1. Preference should be given generally to provision of on-site public access. Off-site public access is appropriate where it would provide more meaningful public access, prevent or minimize safety or security conflicts, or where off-site public access is consistent with an approved public access plan.

2. Public and private property owners should use a variety of techniques, including acquisition, leases, easements and design and development innovations, in order to achieve the public access goals and to provide diverse public access opportunities.

3. Where public access cannot be provided on-site, the City should consider innovative measures to allow permit applicants to provide public access off-site, including contributing to a public access fund to develop planned shoreline access projects.

4. Water-enjoyment and non-water-oriented uses that front on the shoreline should provide continuous public access along the water’s edge.

5. Developments within shoreline jurisdiction that do not have shoreline frontage should provide public access by providing trails or access corridors through or from their sites or by providing view improvements, including viewing platforms.

6. Where new development occurs in a location where access along or to the shoreline already exists, the new development should either contribute additional recreation or access facilities to enhance the existing access, or consider view improvements.

7. An applicant may construct public access improvements before site development as a part of an overall site master plan, which may be phased. The applicant would receive credit for those improvements at time of development.

D. Design Policies.

1. Public access should be designed and located in such a way that does not result in a net loss of ecological functions.

2. Public access associated with marinas, boat ramp/launch facilities, private and public docks for public moorage, and similar water-dependent uses should be provided as close as possible to the water’s edge without significantly adversely affecting a sensitive environment or resulting in significant safety hazards. Improvements should allow physical contact with the water where feasible.

3. Public spaces should be designed to be recognizable as “public” areas and to promote a unified access system, including the design and location of site details and amenities, and to provide a safe and welcoming experience for the public.

4. Public spaces should be designed for the greatest number and diversity of people and for a variety of interests.

5. Public spaces should be designed and located to connect to other public areas, street ends and other pedestrian or public thoroughfares.

6. New public access should be sited and appropriately designed to avoid causing detrimental impacts to the operations of existing water-dependent and water-related uses.

E. General Regulations.

1. Where feasible, new development, uses and activities shall be designed and operated to avoid and minimize blocking, reducing, or adversely interfering with the public’s physical access to the water and shorelines.

2. Public access provided by street ends, public utilities, and public rights-of-way shall not be diminished without full mitigation for those impacts.

3. Existing public access shall not be eliminated unless the applicant shows that there is no feasible alternative and replaces the public access with access of comparable functions and value at another location, consistent with subsection (G)(2) of this section.

4. Publicly financed or subsidized shoreline erosion control measures shall not restrict appropriate public access to the shoreline except where such access is determined to be infeasible because of incompatible uses, safety, or security.

5. Public access easements and shoreline permit conditions shall be recorded on the deed of title and/or on the face of a plat or short plat as a condition of approval. Said recording with the County Auditor’s Office shall occur at the time of shoreline permit approval. Future actions by the applicant and/or successors in interest or other parties shall not diminish the usefulness or value of the public access provided, unless a new shoreline permit is secured.

6. Required public access improvements shall be fully developed and available for public use at the time of occupancy of the use or activity unless there are mitigating circumstances and an agreement setting forth an alternative schedule acceptable to the Examiner is in place.

F. Regulations – Design of Public Access.

1. Public access trails and shared use pathways shall be located, designed and maintained in accordance with all of the following:

a. Where open space is provided along the shoreline and public access can be provided in a manner that will not adversely impact shoreline ecological functions and/or processes, a trail or other shared use pathway generally parallel to the ordinary high water mark of the property may be authorized subject to the following:

(1) The trail or shared use pathway shall be buffered from sensitive ecological features and provide limited and controlled access to sensitive features and the water’s edge where appropriate; and

(2) Fencing may be provided to control damage to plants and other sensitive ecological features, where appropriate.

(3) Landscaping associated with trail or pathway development shall be native and drought tolerant or site appropriate.

(4) Enhancement of shoreline functions, including native plantings, shall be incorporated into trail designs as mitigation for development impacts where necessary and where a clear benefit can be demonstrated.

b. Trails or shared use pathways located within a Natural shoreline environment shall be no greater than six feet in total improved width, which may include up to four feet of surface and one-foot shoulders. Not including landscaping, no more than four feet of improved surface is preferable in most cases.

c. Trails or shared use pathways located in other shoreline environments shall be the minimum width necessary to safely accommodate the proposed use and to avoid and minimize impacts to ecologically sensitive resources. In no case shall they be more than 18 feet in total improved width, which may include up to 14 feet of surfaced trail and two-foot shoulders.

d. Trails or shared use pathways shall be located outside of the vegetation conservation area except when providing access from an upland area to the shoreline, within a public park, or in conjunction with marinas, boat ramp/launch facilities, private and public docks for public moorage, and similar water-dependent uses.

e. Trails or shared use pathways may be located within the shoreline setback and vegetation conservation area when providing an integral link for the Chambers-Leach Creek regional trail system where topography or other physical constraints make it impractical to locate the trail or pathway segment outside of these areas. Such trails or pathways shall be placed at least 25 feet from the ordinary high water mark, except for bridges, limited spurs to physical access points and overlooks comprising no more than 10 percent of the overall lineal length of the proposed trail (see Figure 5 below).

FIGURE 5 – PUBLIC ACCESS TRAIL LOCATIONS
[IMAGE]


f. Gravel, woodchips, or pervious pavement shall be used for trails or shared use pathways within a vegetation conservation area unless the Administrator determines that such material is not in the public interest because of safety, durability, aesthetic or functionality concerns.

g. Trails or shared use pathways shall be subject to compliance with specific design standards or guidelines as described in the Chambers Creek Properties Master Site Plan, the City of University Place Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan, or other trail or recreation plans, when applicable.

2. Public access shall be located adjacent to other public areas, accesses and connecting trails, with connections to the nearest public street; provisions for handicapped and physically impaired persons shall be provided unless infeasible due to site conditions such as steep slopes.

3. Where views of the water or shoreline are available and physical access to the water’s edge is not present or appropriate, a public viewing area shall be provided.

4. Design shall minimize intrusions on privacy by avoiding locations adjacent to windows and/or outdoor private open spaces or by screening or other separation techniques.

5. Design shall provide for the safety of users, including the control of offensive conduct through public visibility of the public access area, or through provisions for oversight. The Administrator may authorize a public access to be temporarily closed in order to develop a program to address offensive conduct. If offensive conduct cannot be reasonably controlled, alternative facilities may be approved through a permit revision.

6. Public amenities appropriate to the use of a public access area such as a covered shelter, benches, or picnic table shall be provided.

7. Commercial or mixed use developments that attract a substantial number of persons, and developments by government/public entities, may be required to provide public restrooms, facilities for disposal of animal waste and other appropriate public facilities.

8. Public access facilities may be developed over water subject to the mitigation sequencing priorities in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(4) and all other applicable provisions of this Shoreline Program. All ecological impacts shall be mitigated to achieve no net loss of shoreline ecological functions and system-wide processes.

G. Public Access – When Required.

1. Public access shall be required to the extent allowed by law in the review of all shoreline substantial development permits and shoreline conditional use permits in the following circumstances:

a. The project is publicly funded or on public lands;

b. The project consists of new or reconstructed publicly funded dikes or levees, jetties, and groins (other than those associated with detached single-family dwellings);

c. Where any of the following conditions exist:

(1) The project increases or creates demand for public access;

(2) The project impacts or interferes with existing access by blocking access or discouraging use of existing access;

(3) The project impacts or interferes with public use of waters subject to the Public Trust Doctrine;

(4) The project includes a non-water-dependent use, or a nonpreferred use under the SMA; or

(5) The project involves the creation of more than four residential lots or dwelling units within shoreline jurisdiction.

2. If public access is required pursuant to subsection (G)(1)(c) of this section, the City shall impose permit conditions requiring public access that is roughly proportional to the impacts caused by the proposed use or development.

3. When public access is required pursuant to subsection (G)(1)(c) of this section, the Examiner shall make specific findings that the use or development satisfies one or more of the conditions in subsection (G)(1)(c) of this section and that the permit conditions requiring public access are roughly proportional to the impacts caused by the proposed use or development.

4. Public access shall not be required for the following uses or activities:

a. Single-family residential developments consisting of four or fewer residential lots or dwelling units;

b. Agricultural activities;

c. Dredging;

d. Landfill and excavation;

e. Private docks serving four or fewer dwelling units;

f. Instream structures, unless publicly funded;

g. Shoreline stabilization, unless publicly funded;

h. Utility projects; or

i. Ecological restoration or enhancement activities not associated with development.

H. Access Preferences and Alternatives.

1. On-site, physical access is preferred.

2. The Examiner may approve alternatives to on-site, physical access to the shoreline if the applicant can demonstrate with substantial and credible evidence that one or more of the following conditions exist:

a. Unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public exist which cannot be prevented by any practical means;

b. The configuration of existing parcels and structures block potential access areas in such a way that cannot be reasonably remedied by the proposed development;

c. Public access will jeopardize inherent security requirements of the proposed development or use and the impacts on security cannot be satisfied through the application of alternative design features or other solutions;

d. The cost of providing on-site access, easement, or an alternative amenity is unreasonably disproportionate to the total long-term cost of the proposed development;

e. Environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated, such as damage to spawning areas or nesting areas, will result from the public access; or

f. Public access is infeasible due to incompatible adjacent uses where the incompatibility cannot be mitigated.

3. Prior to approving alternatives to on-site physical access due to one or more of the conditions listed in subsection (H)(2) of this section, the Examiner should first consider on-site access alternatives such as limiting hours to daylight use, using alternative site configurations, or incorporating design elements such as fences, terraces, hedges, and/or other landscaping to separate uses and activities.

4. When public access is required pursuant to subsection (G)(1) of this section, the Examiner may approve public access under subsection (H)(2) of this section that includes the preservation of shoreline views consistent with UPMC 18.25.110, the establishment of public access easements to and along the shoreline, and/or enhancement of an adjacent street end, park, or other public access feature commensurate with the degree of impact caused by the development. These alternative forms of public access shall not be required by the Examiner when public access is not required pursuant to subsection (G)(1) of this section.

5. A project applicant may participate in “advance mitigation” by providing public access improvements prior to the time a project is constructed.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.060 Scientific and educational activities.

A. Intent and Applicability. It is the intent of the City to preserve and prevent the destruction of or damage to any site having scientific or educational value, excluding schools, museums or similar facilities, and to support scientific and educational efforts when appropriate ecological safeguards are utilized. Examples may include, but are not limited to, water quality testing, stream flow monitoring, and the installation of interpretive signage.

B. Policies.

1. Encourage scientific and educational activities related to shoreline ecological functions and processes.

C. Regulations.

1. Scientific and educational uses and activities are limited to those that will not:

a. Jeopardize existing wildlife populations or organisms;

b. Permanently alter the character of biological habitats; and

c. Degrade the character of the shoreline environment in which they are located.

2. Temporary disruption of biological systems may be authorized when a scientific activity will result in their restoration or improvement, and only when a restoration plan is approved by the City and other agencies with jurisdiction.

3. Permits encompassing a variety of scientific or educational activities over an extended period of time may be granted; provided, that limits on the duration of approval are established. Temporary facilities necessary for the conduct of a scientific project shall be removed at the conclusion of the prescribed research activity period.

4. Temporary facilities used in conjunction with the scientific or educational project shall be removed at the conclusion of the project.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.070 Shoreline ecological protection and mitigation.

A. Intent and Applicability.

1. The Shoreline Management Act and the Shoreline Master Program Guidelines place a primary emphasis on the protection of shoreline ecological functions and system-wide processes. In accordance with Chapter 173-26 WAC, this Shoreline Program must ensure that shoreline uses, activities, and modifications will result in no net loss to these processes and functions.

2. The protection, restoration and enhancement of shoreline ecological functions and system-wide processes are high priorities of this Shoreline Program. The policies and regulations established herein are to be applied to all uses, developments and activities that may occur within the shoreline jurisdiction.

B. Policies.

1. All shoreline use and development should be carried out in a manner that avoids or minimizes adverse impacts so that the resulting ecological condition does not become worse than the current condition. This means assuring no net loss of ecological functions and processes and protecting critical areas that are located within the shoreline jurisdiction.

2. Natural features of the shoreline and nearshore environments that provide ecological functions and should be protected include marine and freshwater riparian habitat, banks and bluffs, beaches and backshore, critical saltwater and freshwater habitat, and wetlands and streams. Shoreline processes that should be protected include erosion and accretion, sediment delivery, transport and storage, organic matter input, and large woody debris recruitment.

3. Important habitat that provides the shoreline’s unique value, including estuaries and critical saltwater habitats that include intertidal wetlands, kelp beds, eelgrass beds and spawning areas for forage fish such as sand lance, sand spits, mud flats, and areas with which priority species have a primary association, should be preserved and protected.

4. Protection and restoration of critical saltwater habitats should integrate management of shorelands as well as submerged areas.

5. Direct and indirect cumulative impacts of proposed actions should be considered for all use and development of the shoreline.

6. Development standards for density, setbacks, impervious surface, shoreline stabilization, vegetation conservation, critical areas, and water quality should protect existing shoreline functions and processes. During review, the Administrator should consider the expected impacts associated with proposed shoreline development when assessing compliance with this policy.

7. Where a proposed use or development creates environmental impacts not otherwise avoided or mitigated by compliance with this Shoreline Program, mitigation measures should be required to ensure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions and system-wide processes.

8. The City should work with other local, State, and Federal regulatory agencies, tribes, and nongovernment organizations to ensure that mitigation actions carried out in support of this Shoreline Program are designed to be successful and achieve beneficial ecological outcomes. This includes such measures as mitigation banks, fee-in-lieu programs, and assisting applicants/proponents in planning, designing, and implementing mitigation.

9. The City should develop a program to periodically review conditions on the shoreline and conduct appropriate analysis to determine whether or not other actions are necessary to protect and restore shoreline ecology to ensure no net loss of ecological functions.

C. Regulations – No Net Loss and Mitigation.

1. All shoreline uses and development, including preferred uses and uses that are exempt from shoreline permit requirements, shall be located, designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner that results in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions and processes.

2. To comply with the policies in subsection (B) of this section, applicants/proponents of new shoreline use and development shall demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been taken to avoid adverse impacts. Mitigation shall occur in the following order of priority. In determining appropriate mitigation measures, lower priority measures shall be applied only when higher priority measures are determined to be infeasible or inapplicable.

a. Avoiding the adverse impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action, or moving the action;

b. Minimizing adverse impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology and engineering, or taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce adverse impacts;

c. Rectifying the adverse impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment;

d. Reducing or eliminating the adverse impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

e. Compensating for the adverse impacts by replacing, enhancing, or providing similar substitute resources or environments; and

f. Monitoring the impact of the compensatory projects and taking appropriate corrective measures.

3. Mitigation actions shall not have a significant adverse impact on other shoreline ecological functions.

4. When compensatory mitigation measures are required, all of the following shall apply:

a. The quality and quantity of the replaced, enhanced, or substituted resources shall be the same or better than the affected resources;

b. The mitigation site and associated vegetative planting shall be nurtured and maintained such that healthy native plant communities can grow and mature over time;

c. The mitigation shall be informed by pertinent scientific and technical studies, including but not limited to the Shoreline Inventory and Characterization Report, the Shoreline Restoration Plan and other background studies prepared in support of this Shoreline Program;

d. The mitigation plan shall include contingencies should the mitigation fail during the monitoring/maintenance period;

e. The mitigation shall replace the functions as quickly as possible following the impacts to ensure no net loss;

f. The mitigation activity shall be monitored and maintained to ensure that it achieves its intended functions and values; and

g. The applicant shall post a financial surety equal to the estimated cost of the mitigation in order to ensure the mitigation is carried out successfully. The surety shall be refunded to the applicant upon completion of the mitigation activity and any required monitoring.

5. Mitigation measures shall occur in the immediate vicinity of the impact or at an alternative location within the same watershed or appropriate section of marine shoreline that provides greater and more sustainable ecological benefits. When evaluating these benefits, the City shall consider limiting factors, critical habitat needs, and other factors identified in the Restoration Plan (Appendix A), or an approved watershed or comprehensive resource management plan. The City may also approve use of alternative mitigation practices such as in-lieu fee programs, mitigation banks, and other similar approaches, provided they have been approved and sanctioned by the Department of Ecology, the Department of Fish and Wildlife or the Army Corps of Engineers. When uses or activities are proposed along shorelines that also contain critical areas, vegetation management plans may be consolidated with habitat management plans required under UPMC 17.25.025.

D. Regulations – Critical Areas.

1. The City’s critical areas regulations, codified under UPMC Title 17, apply to critical areas in the shoreline jurisdiction. Chapters 17.05, 17.10, 17.15, 17.20, 17.25, 17.30 and 17.35 UPMC are herein incorporated into this SMP, except as noted in subsection (D)(5) of this section. The critical areas regulations being incorporated into the SMP are those referenced in Ordinance No. 630, effective October 28, 2013, and Ordinance No. 670, effective June 27, 2016. In the event these regulations are amended, the edition referenced herein will still apply in shoreline jurisdiction. Changing this reference to recognize a new edition will require a master program amendment.

2. If there are any conflicts or unclear distinctions between this Shoreline Program and the critical areas regulations, the requirements that are the most specific shall apply.

3. All uses and development occurring within the shoreline jurisdiction shall comply with the City’s critical area regulations as adopted herein.

4. Nonconforming structures and uses within critical areas that are within shoreline areas shall be subject to the provisions of this Shoreline Program.

5. Critical areas provisions that are not consistent with the SMA, Chapter 90.85 RCW, and supporting Washington Administrative Code chapters shall not apply in shoreline jurisdiction, as follows:

a. Critical area provisions do not extend shoreline jurisdiction beyond the limits specified in this Shoreline Program. For regulations addressing critical area buffer areas that are outside shoreline jurisdiction, see UPMC Title 17.

b. Provisions relating to variance procedures and criteria in Chapter 17.10 UPMC do not apply in shoreline jurisdiction. Variance procedures and criteria have been established in UPMC 18.15.050 and in WAC 173-27-170.

c. Reasonable uses exceptions in Chapter 17.10 UPMC are not available for relief from critical area standards within the shoreline jurisdiction. Instead, applicants seeking relief from the critical area standards shall apply for a shoreline variance.

d. Provisions relating to the substitution of Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 individual permits for City of University Place wetland reviews do not apply in shoreline jurisdiction, as the Section 404 individual permit review process may not fully address requirements of this Shoreline Program.

e. In shoreline jurisdiction, identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries shall be done in accordance with the approved Federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements, per WAC 173-22-035. Specifically, the delineation and wetland analysis requirements in UPMC 17.35.025(A) do not apply.

f. In shoreline jurisdiction, the wetland point scale used to separate wetland categories in UPMC 17.35.020(A) through (D) does not apply. Category I wetlands are those that score 23 or more points, Category II wetlands are those that score between 20 and 22 points, Category III wetlands are those that score between 16 and 19 points, and Category IV wetlands are those that score between nine and 15 points.

g. In shoreline jurisdiction, fish and wildlife habitat areas as defined in UPMC 17.10.005 shall not include such artificial features or constructs as irrigation delivery systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or drainage ditches that lie within the boundaries of and are maintained by a port district or an irrigation district or company.

E. Regulations – Critical Saltwater Habitats.

1. Docks, piers, bulkheads, bridges, fill, floats, jetties, utility crossings, and other human- made structures shall not intrude into or over critical saltwater habitats except when all of the conditions below are met:

a. The public’s need for such an action or structure is clearly demonstrated and the proposal is consistent with protection of the public trust, as embodied in RCW 90.58.020;

b. Avoidance of impacts to critical saltwater habitats by an alternative alignment or location is not feasible or would result in unreasonable and disproportionate cost to accomplish the same general purpose;

c. The project, including any required mitigation, will result in no net loss of ecological functions associated with critical saltwater habitat; and

d. The project is consistent with the State’s interest in resource protection and species recovery.

2. Private, noncommercial docks, including piers, ramps and floats, for individual residential or community use may be authorized; provided, that:

a. Avoidance of impacts to critical saltwater habitats by an alternative alignment or location is not feasible; and

b. The project, including any required mitigation, will result in no net loss of ecological functions associated with critical saltwater habitat.

3. Until an inventory of critical saltwater habitat has been done, the City shall require all over-water and near-shore developments in marine and estuarine waters to perform an inventory of the site and adjacent beach sections to assess the presence of critical saltwater habitats and functions. The methods and extent of the inventory shall be consistent with accepted research methodology. At a minimum, the City and applicant should consult with Department of Ecology technical assistance materials for guidance.

F. Regulations – Geologically Hazardous Areas.

1. New development or the creation of new lots that would cause foreseeable risk from geological conditions during the life of the development is prohibited.

2. New development that would require structural shoreline stabilization over the life of the development, except where stabilization is needed to protect allowed uses where no alternative locations are available and no net loss of ecological functions will result, is prohibited.

G. Regulations – Cumulative Impacts.

1. In the granting of all conditional use permits and variances, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

2. When determining whether a proposed use or development could cause a net loss of ecological functions, the cumulative impacts of individual uses and developments, including preferred uses and uses that are exempt from permit requirements, shall be considered.

3. The City may require the applicant/proponent to prepare special studies, assessments and analyses as necessary to identify and address cumulative impacts including, but not limited to, impacts on fish and wildlife habitat, public access/use, aesthetics, and other shoreline attributes.

4. Proponents of shoreline use and development shall take the following factors into account when assessing cumulative impacts:

a. Current ecological functions and human factors influencing shoreline natural processes;

b. Reasonably foreseeable future use and development of the shoreline;

c. Beneficial effects of any established regulatory programs under other local, State and Federal laws; and

d. Mitigation measures implemented in conjunction with the proposed project to avoid, reduce, and/or compensate for adverse impacts.

e. Any use or development that will result in or contribute to unmitigated cumulative impacts is prohibited.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.080 Shoreline restoration and enhancement.

A. Intent and Applicability. Restoration refers to the reestablishment or upgrading of impaired ecological shoreline processes or functions. The following policies and regulations are intended to guide actions that are designed to achieve improvements in shoreline ecological functions over time in shoreline areas where such functions have been degraded. The overarching purpose is to achieve overall improvements over time when compared to the condition upon adoption of this Shoreline Program, as detailed in the Shoreline Inventory and Characterization Report.

Restoration is distinct from mitigation measures necessary to achieve no net loss of shoreline functions, and the City’s commitment to plan for restoration will not be implemented through regulatory means. This Shoreline Program recognizes the importance of restoration of shoreline ecological functions and processes and encourages cooperative restoration efforts and programs between local, State, and Federal public agencies, tribes, nonprofit organizations, and landowners to address shoreline with impaired ecological functions and/or processes.

B. Policies.

1. Restoration actions should restore shoreline ecological functions and processes as well as shoreline features and should be targeted towards meeting the needs of sensitive and/or locally important plant, fish and wildlife species as well as the biologic recovery goals for local species and populations.

2. Restoration and enhancement should be integrated with other natural resource management efforts such as the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan and the University Place Comprehensive Plan.

3. Restoration actions outside of the shoreline jurisdiction that have a system-wide benefit should be considered.

4. When prioritizing restoration actions, the City should give highest priority to measures that have the greatest chance of re-establishing shoreline ecological functions and processes.

5. Restoration and enhancement measures should be incorporated into the design and construction of new uses and development, public infrastructure (e.g., roads and utilities), and public recreation facilities.

C. Regulations.

1. Restoration and enhancement shall be allowed on all shorelines, and carried out by the applicant/proponent in accordance with an approved vegetation management plan. This plan shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the requirements of UPMC 18.25.100(G).

2. Restoration/enhancement projects shall be designed to increase quality, width and diversity of native vegetation riparian habitats to provide safe migration pathways for fish and wildlife, food, nest sites, shade, perches, and organic debris, where appropriate. Projects should strive to control nonindigenous plants or weeds that adversely affect native vegetation or habitats.

3. In accordance with RCW 90.58.580, a Substantial Development Permit is not required for development on land that is brought under shoreline jurisdiction due to a shoreline restoration project. However, projects are still required to comply with the regulations of this Master Program.

4. Projects taking place on lands that are brought into shoreline jurisdiction due to a shoreline restoration project that caused a landward shift of the OHWM may apply to the Administrator for relief from the SMP development standards and use regulations under the provisions of RCW 90.58.580. Any relief granted shall be strictly in accordance with the limited provisions of RCW 90.58.580, including the specific approval of the Department of Ecology.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.090 Signage.

A. Signage Policies.

1. Signs should not block or otherwise interfere with visual access to the water or shorelands.

2. Signs should be designed and placed so that they are compatible with the aesthetic quality of the existing shoreline and adjacent land and water uses.

B. Signage Regulations.

1. Signage shall be regulated in conformance with Chapter 19.75 UPMC, Signs, except that the following provisions shall apply within the shoreline jurisdiction:

a. All off-site signs, except for directional signs, shall be prohibited;

b. All signs shall be located and designed to avoid interference with vistas, viewpoints, and visual access to the shoreline;

c. Signs shall be designed and placed so that they are compatible with the aesthetic quality of the existing shoreline and adjacent land and water uses;

d. Over-water signs and signs on overwater structures or pilings, except as needed for navigational purposes, shall be prohibited; and

e. Lighted signs shall be designed to reduce glare when viewed from surrounding properties or water courses and avoid the direct shining of light into bodies of water.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.100 Vegetation conservation.

A. Intent and Applicability. Vegetation conservation includes activities to protect and restore vegetation, specifically native trees and shrubs, along or near marine or freshwater shorelines to minimize habitat loss and the impact of invasive plants, erosion and flooding and contribute to the ecological functions of shoreline areas.

The provisions of this section establish vegetation conservation areas (VCAs), and set forth policies and regulations to limit the removal of native vegetation, encourage the restoration of native vegetation, control invasive weeds and nonnative species, and provide for appropriate tree pruning and maintenance. Vegetation conservation provisions apply to shoreline uses and developments, even if they are exempt from the requirement to obtain a permit.

B. Policies.

1. Developments and activities within the shoreline jurisdiction should be planned and designed to protect, conserve and restore native vegetation in order to protect and restore shoreline ecological functions and system-wide processes performed within riparian and nearshore areas, which include but are not limited to:

a. Providing shade necessary to maintain conditions suitable for nearshore aquatic biota and habitats;

b. Regulating microclimate in riparian and nearshore areas;

c. Providing organic inputs necessary for aquatic life, including providing food in the form of various insects and other benthic macro invertebrates;

d. Stabilizing banks, minimizing erosion and sedimentation, and reducing the occurrence/severity of landslides;

e. Reducing fine sediment input into the aquatic environment by minimizing erosion, aiding infiltration, and retaining runoff;

f. Improving water quality through filtration and vegetative uptake of nutrients and pollutants;

g. Providing a source of large woody debris to moderate flows, create hydraulic roughness, form pools, and increase aquatic diversity for salmonids and other species; and

h. Providing habitat for wildlife, including connectivity for travel and migration corridors.

2. Clearing and grading within VCA setbacks and VCAs should be restricted in order to maintain the functions and values of the shoreline environment, including protection of habitat, steep slopes and shoreline bluffs. Applicants should demonstrate that such alterations are the minimum necessary to accommodate a proposed use or development.

3. Adverse environmental and shoreline impacts of clearing and grading should be avoided wherever possible through proper site planning to avoid existing vegetation, construction timing and practices, bank stabilization, soil bioengineering and use of erosion and drainage control methods.

4. Shoreline uses and development should establish native shoreline vegetation so that the composition, structure and density of the vegetation resemble a natural, unaltered shoreline to the greatest extent possible.

5. Maintaining a well-vegetated shoreline with native species is preferred over clearing vegetation to create views or provide lawns. Limited and selective clearing for views and lawns, or for safety, may be allowed when slope stability and ecological functions are not compromised, but landowners should not assume that an unobstructed view of the water is guaranteed. Trimming and pruning are preferred over removal of native vegetation. Property owners are encouraged to avoid or minimize the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.

6. New lawns should not be established within the VCA due to their limited erosion control value, limited water retention capacity, and associated chemical and fertilizer applications.

7. Property owners are encouraged to preserve and enhance woody vegetation and native groundcovers to stabilize soils and provide habitat. Maintaining native plant communities is preferred over nonnative ornamental plantings because of their ecological value.

8. Educational materials should be provided and a public outreach program that educates landowners adjacent to shorelines about the importance of maintaining and enhancing vegetation along the shoreline should be established.

C. Regulations – General.

1. Parcels with frontage on marine waters, streams or wetlands shall preserve existing native vegetation, or where the development footprint is increased within a VCA, native vegetation shall be restored or enhanced within the following VCAs:

a. Within the Day Island Medium Intensity shoreline environment, the minimum width of the VCA shall be 25 feet measured landward of and perpendicular to the ordinary high water mark.

b. Within the Shoreline Residential shoreline environment, the minimum width of the VCA shall be 25 feet measured landward of and perpendicular to the ordinary high water mark. Properties within Sunset Beach and Day Island South Spit, and properties within other areas of Day Island that have an existing single-family dwelling located within 10 feet of the ordinary high water mark or which have at least 50 percent of the VCA occupied by an existing single-family dwelling and other primary structures, shall be exempt from the VCA restoration and enhancement requirements in UPMC 18.25.100(F)(1) due to the physical characteristics of the existing built environment, which make it impracticable to enhance or restore VCAs.

c. Within the Urban Conservancy shoreline environment, the minimum width of the VCA shall be 40 feet measured landward of and perpendicular to the ordinary high water mark.

d. Within the Natural shoreline environment, the minimum width of the VCA shall be 150 feet measured landward of and perpendicular to the ordinary high water mark.

2. Where structural shoreline stabilization such as a bulkhead is present, the VCA shall be measured from the landward edge of the stabilization structure to the width required by the designated shoreline environment.

3. A building setback of at least 10 feet from the landward edge of the VCA shall be required as per Table 18.30.B.

4. Development on parcels located within or adjacent to critical areas and critical area buffers must include vegetation in accordance with the provisions of UPMC Title 17, as incorporated into this SMP. Where conflicting standards are present, the more restrictive shall apply.

5. Except as provided herein, applicants for new development, expansion, or redevelopment within the VCA shall protect existing native vegetation within the VCA. If native vegetation within the VCA has been destroyed or significantly degraded, the applicant shall mitigate by restoring or enhancing the VCA in accordance with the provisions of this section and mitigation sequencing priorities in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2).

6. Nonconforming and water-dependent uses that cannot provide a VCA due to the nature of the use or activity shall provide an equivalent area of vegetation elsewhere on the subject property. If it is not feasible to provide vegetation on site due to constraints such as lot size, lot configuration, topography, or existing site improvements, vegetation shall be provided off site in accordance with the provisions of UPMC 18.25.070(C)(5).

D. Regulations – Allowed Uses and Activities.

1. The following uses and activities may be authorized within the VCA if also allowed within the associated shoreline environment designation. Uses or activities listed in subsections (D)(1)(a) through (j) of this section shall be located in the outer half of the required VCA to the greatest extent feasible. If an allowed nonresidential use or activity requires more area than the allowed percentage outlined in subsection (D)(2) of this section, such as transportation facilities, utilities and public recreation trails, the applicant shall ensure that the proposed use or activity will not result in a net loss to shoreline ecological functions and plant vegetation in an equivalent area elsewhere on-site within the shoreline area. The Administrator shall utilize mitigation sequencing priorities in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2) when considering intrusions into VCAs.

a. Transportation facilities and utilities only when it has been determined that alternative upland locations are not feasible;

b. Pedestrian access from upland areas to the shoreline, piers, docks, launch ramps, viewing platforms, wildlife viewing blinds and other similar water-oriented uses in accordance with UPMC 18.25.050(F)(1);

e. Educational facilities such as viewing platforms, wildlife viewing blinds and interpretive sites;

f. Water-dependent uses and equipment necessary for conducting water-dependent uses such as boat travel lifts for boat maintenance and upland storage;

g. Improvements that are part of an approved enhancement, restoration, or mitigation plan;

h. Shoreline stabilization only when it is part of an approved project.

i. Uncovered single-family residential decks, patios, access paths and play surfaces utilizing pervious materials and designs;

j. Benches, tables, hot tubs, fire pits, play equipment and other similar accessory structures or equipment provided in conjunction with a single-family residence; and

k. Removal of noxious weeds or hazardous trees.

2. Up to 25 percent of the VCA in a Shoreline Residential, Urban Conservancy, or Day Island Medium Intensity shoreline environment, and up to 10 percent of the VCA in a Natural shoreline environment, may be utilized for authorized uses and activities listed in subsections (D)(1)(a) through (j) of this section. Portions of the VCA occupied by primary structures, accessory structures, and other uses and activities that are not permitted under subsections (D)(1)(a) through (j) of this section, but which exist as of the effective date of this Shoreline Program, shall count toward these limits.

E. Regulations – Single-Family Residential Provisions.

1. Construction of new single-family residential structures and alterations to existing single- family residential properties, including primary structures, accessory structures and other improvements listed in subsections (D)(1)(i) and (j) of this section, shall protect existing native vegetation within the VCA.

FIGURE 6 – ALLOWABLE USES AND ACTIVITIES IN VEGETATION CONSERVATION AREA
[IMAGE]


2. New single-family residences and other primary residential structures are not allowed within the VCA.

3. Within the Shoreline Residential shoreline environment, improvements listed in subsections (D)(1)(i) and (j) of this section, and pedestrian access authorized in UPMC 18.25.050(F), are allowed within the VCA subject to the following limitations:

a. Accessory structures and access paths shall cover no more than 25 percent of the VCA or 400 square feet, whichever is less;

b. Pervious materials and designs are used for walking or outdoor activity surfaces such as decks, patios, access paths and play surfaces;

c. Accessory structures, improvements and equipment allowed under this section shall maintain a minimum setback of 15 feet from the ordinary high water mark, except where an existing single-family residence is located within the VCA, this setback may be reduced by one foot for every foot the existing single-family residence encroaches into the VCA, to a minimum of five feet from the ordinary high water mark; and

d. The walking surface of decks or patios is no more than two feet above grade and is not covered.

4. Within the Day Island Medium Intensity, Urban Conservancy or Natural shoreline environments, new accessory structures and improvements not listed in subsections (D)(1)(i) and (j) of this section are not allowed within the VCA.

5. The development footprint shall not be increased within the VCA except in accordance with subsections (D) and (E) of this section. Expansions of existing primary structures and uses and activities not listed in subsections (D)(1)(a) through (j) of this section are not permitted within the VCA.

6. Where a nonconforming single-family residential property cannot provide the full width of the VCA plus an additional 10-foot building setback from the landward edge of the VCA, an equivalent area of vegetation shall be provided elsewhere on the site within shoreline jurisdiction at a location as close to the VCA as feasible. If it is not feasible to provide vegetation on site due to constraints such as lot size, topography, or existing site improvements, off-site enhancement should be considered, or the Administrator may waive some or all of the VCA requirements on a case-by-case basis. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that complying with the provisions of this section is not feasible. The Administrator shall consider the following criteria when determining feasibility and reviewing alternative enhancement, including, but not limited to:

a. An existing home and other primary structures located within and encompassing more than 50 percent of a VCA may be considered sufficient justification for demonstrating infeasibility;

b. Accessory structures and other improvements located within a VCA that are of a relatively temporary nature or that may be relatively easily removed such as landscaping and outdoor recreation improvements (decks, patios, sport courts and walkways) are not sufficient justification for demonstrating infeasibility;

c. The applicant can establish that a proposal for vegetation enhancement in areas outside of the VCA will result in no net loss of shoreline functions; and

d. Shoreline enhancement would be provided in lieu of vegetation enhancement, such as replacing hard armoring with soft armoring, removal of existing groins, etc.

F. Development Standards.

1. If the development footprint within the VCA would be increased by an allowed alteration, and if the VCA does not contain native vegetation or the native vegetation within the VCA has been significantly degraded, vegetation shall be required as follows:

	VCA Enhancement and Restoration Requirements

	Percentage Increase in Development Footprint within VCA	Percent of VCA Required to Be Enhanced or Restored

	20 percent or less	20 percent

	20.1 – 30 percent	40 percent

	30.1 – 40 percent	60 percent

	40.1 – 50 percent	80 percent

	50.1 percent or more	100 percent

Where sufficient area for enhancement or restoration is not available within the required VCA, other portions of the site or off-site enhancement opportunities should be considered, as described in subsection (E)(6) of this section.

2. Unauthorized clearing, grading, or vegetation removal is prohibited. Clearing, grading and vegetation removal within shoreline setbacks and VCAs shall be the minimum necessary for the intended use or development.

3. The width of a VCA may be averaged to account for variation in site conditions and to create a more natural arrangement of plantings (see Figure 7 below). The total square footage of landscaped area shall be calculated based on the minimum width area specified for each shoreline environment in subsection (C)(1) of this section. Area lost through reduction of the VCA width must be added to another portion of the VCA, which will result in no loss of VCA area. The minimum reduced width of the averaged area shall be no less than 50 percent of the minimum width specified in subsection (C)(1) of this section. The averaged VCA shall be configured to include all existing trees over six inches’ diameter breast height to the extent feasible.

4. When restoring or enhancing shoreline vegetation, applicants shall use native species that are of a similar diversity, density and type commonly found in riparian areas of western Washington. The vegetation shall be nurtured and maintained to ensure establishment of a healthy and sustainable native plant community over time. The preferred location of replacement vegetation is generally abutting, and parallel to, the OHWM or bulkhead rather than along a side property line or other location that is generally running perpendicular to the OHWM or bulkhead.

5. Trimming of trees and vegetation is allowed within the VCA subject to the following:

a. The limbing or crown thinning of trees larger than three inches’ dbh shall comply with International Society of Arboriculture Best Management Practices: Tree Pruning and ANSI A300 Standards. No more than 25 percent of the limbs on any single tree may be removed and no more than 25 percent of the canopy cover in any single stand of trees may be removed for a single view corridor. Trees determined to be damaged, diseased or safety hazards in accordance with UPMC 19.65.270, Tree retention, are exempt from these standards.

b. The trimming shall not directly impact the nearshore functions and values including fish and wildlife habitat;

FIGURE 7 – VEGETATION CONSERVATION AREA AVERAGING
[IMAGE]


*THE WIDTH OF A VCA MAY BE AVERAGED TO ACCOUNT FOR VARIATION IN SITE CONDITIONS AND TO CREATE A MORE NATURAL ARRANGEMENT OF PLANTING.

** INCREASED NATIVE VEGETATION IS ONLY REQUIRED WHERE THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT FOOTPRINT WITHIN THE VCA (UPMC 18.25.100(F)).

c. The trimming is not located within a critical area or associated buffer, unless such activity is exempt from the requirements of UPMC 17.15.030;

d. The trimming retains branches that hang over the water when feasible;

e. The trimming does not include tree topping, which is prohibited; and

f. The trimming does not include clearing of trees or vegetation.

6. Vegetation shall be maintained over the life of the use or development.

7. VCAs for uses other than single-family residences shall be placed in a separate tract in which development, other than public access facilities, is prohibited; protected by execution of an easement dedicated to a conservation organization or land trust; or similarly preserved through a permanent protective mechanism acceptable to the City.

8. Construction of new single-family residences or alterations to existing single-family residences that trigger restoration or enhancement of VCAs shall require a title notice to be recorded with the Pierce County Auditor, on forms provided by the City, describing development limitations and preservation requirements within the VCA.

9. Aquatic vegetation control shall only occur when native plant communities and associated habitats are threatened or where an existing water-dependent use is restricted by the presence of weeds. Aquatic vegetation control shall occur in compliance with all other applicable laws and standards, including Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and Department of Ecology requirements.

G. Regulations – Vegetation Management Plan.

1. Clearing, grading and construction within the VCA shall only be authorized upon approval of a vegetation management plan, except when a proposal is deemed exempt from this plan requirement in accordance with subsection (G)(2) of this section. The vegetation management plan shall include or be subject to the following:

a. A map illustrating the distribution of existing plant communities in the area proposed for management. The map must be accompanied by a description of the vegetative condition of the site, including plant species, plant density, tree diameter at breast height; any natural or manmade disturbances, overhanging vegetation, and the functions served by the existing plant community (e.g., fish and wildlife values, slope stabilization);

b. A description of how mitigation sequencing in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2) was used and how the plan achieves no net loss of shoreline ecological functions the vegetation is providing;

c. A description of the shade conditions created by existing vegetation. This description shall include an inventory of overhanging vegetation as well as a determination of how much shade is created by standing trees in order to assess the level of function that overhanging vegetation may be providing in terms of shade, cover, food resources and other functions;

d. A detailed landscape map indicating which areas will be preserved and which will be cleared, including tree removal;

e. Drawings illustrating the proposed landscape scheme, including the species, distribution, and density of plants. Any pathways or nonvegetated portions and uses shall be noted;

f. A description of any vegetation introduced for the purposes of fish and wildlife habitat;

g. Loss of wildlife habitat shall be mitigated on site. If on-site mitigation habitat is not possible, off-site mitigation shall be authorized in accordance with UPMC 18.25.070(C)(5); and

h. Installation of vegetation shall meet the following standards:

(1) Native species that are of a similar diversity, density and type commonly found in riparian areas of western Washington, and of a similar diversity and type to that occurring in the general vicinity of the site prior to any shoreline alteration, shall be used unless nonnative substitutes are authorized by the Administrator based on limited availability of native materials and the appropriateness of nonnative vegetation relative to soil and climate conditions;

(2) At the time of planting, plant materials shall be consistent with the standards in Chapter 19.65 UPMC, Landscaping/Trees, where applicable;

(3) The applicant may be required to install and implement an irrigation system to ensure survival of vegetation planted. For remote areas lacking access to a water system, an alternative watering method may be approved;

(4) Planting in the fall or early spring is preferred over summer for purposes of plant establishment; and

(5) For a period of five years after initial planting, the applicant shall replace any unhealthy or dead vegetation as part of an approved vegetation management plan. A landscaping maintenance guaranty equal to the cost of the landscaping less any irrigation system may be required prior to final project approval or release of any landscape performance bond that may also be required for the project. At the end of the five-year period, the applicant shall request that the City inspect the landscaping to ensure all planted material is alive and healthy. Any plant material needing replacement shall be replaced during the spring or fall growing season following plant loss, but not greater than 180 days from time of loss, and inspected prior to the release of the maintenance guaranty.

2. The Administrator may waive the requirement for a vegetation management plan for clearing, grading, construction, the installation of improvements listed in subsections (D)(1)(i) and (j) of this section, and the installation of pedestrian access authorized in UPMC 18.25.050(F), within the shoreline jurisdiction of a single-family residential property when all of the following standards are met:

a. The amount of shoreline jurisdiction that would be affected by the alteration does not exceed 100 square feet;

b. The cumulative total of shoreline jurisdiction that would be affected by the proposed alteration plus the shoreline area for which a vegetation management plan has previously been waived by the Administrator does not exceed 100 square feet;

c. The alteration would not result in the removal of any existing woody vegetation within the VCA;

d. The alteration would result in no net loss of shoreline function;

e. Where the development footprint would be increased by the proposed alteration, vegetation within the VCA will be enhanced or restored in accordance with subsection (F)(1) of this section.

3. The Administrator may waive some, but not all, of the vegetation enhancement or restoration requirements when the applicant proposes to improve shoreline ecological functions of the shoreline, through the removal of invasive species, shoreline restoration/enhancement, or removal of hard armoring. The applicant must demonstrate:

a. The proposed alternative(s) to vegetation enhancement or restoration would achieve the same or greater benefit to shoreline ecology as vegetation enhancement or restoration than would otherwise be required; and

b. The alteration, when considered in conjunction with the proposed alternatives to vegetation enhancement or restoration, would result in no net loss of shoreline function.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.110 View protection.

A. Intent. Over four miles (65 percent) of University Place’s marine shoreline is under public ownership (Pierce County) or owned by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. The County’s Chambers Creek Properties provide opportunities for the public to enjoy views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains beyond. The Railroad effectively maintains an unobstructed linear corridor that preserves views from upland areas east of the tracks to the shoreline west of the tracks, due to the nearly complete absence of structures and substantial vegetation within the right-of-way. With the 2010 completion of the North Dock pedestrian overpass, which connects upland areas of the Chambers Creek Properties to several miles of beach on the waterward side of the railroad right-of-way, visual access to the shoreline has been greatly expanded. In addition, most of the freshwater shorelands within the Chambers Creek Canyon are publicly owned, either by Pierce County or the City of University Place. Future expansion of regional trail facilities within the canyon will expand opportunities for the public to enjoy the scenic qualities of the area.

The preservation and/or protection of scenic vistas, public views of the water and adjoining shoreline, and other aesthetic qualities of shorelines for public enjoyment is an important objective of this Shoreline Program. Protection of vistas and views can be achieved through multiple strategies including public ownership and use of shorelands, the inclusion of public access and viewpoints in private development, establishing key view corridors, establishing height limits and design standards, encouraging shoreline uses to orient towards the City’s shoreline resources, and requiring visual assessments where views may be impacted.

B. View and Aesthetic Policies.

1. Views and vistas to and from the water, by public and private entities, should be preserved to ensure that the public may continue to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline, including views of the water and views of shoreline areas from the water. Shoreline use and development activities should be designed and operated to minimize obstructions to the public’s visual access to the water and shoreline. Views and the physical form of the waterfront should be preserved by maintaining low structures near the water and at the tops of the bluffs, and by allowing non-view-blocking vertical development at the base of the bluffs.

2. New development should emphasize the water as a unique community asset.

3. To the extent feasible and consistent with the overall best interest of the State and the people generally, the public’s opportunity to enjoy the aesthetic qualities of shorelines of the State, including views of the water, should be advanced.

4. Shoreline use and development should not significantly detract from shoreline scenic and aesthetic qualities that are derived from natural or cultural features, such as shoreforms, vegetative cover and historic sites/structures.

5. New uses and developments in shoreline areas should be designed and constructed for a “human scale” and pedestrian orientation. View and public access corridors should be designed and developed to encourage pedestrian uses. The development of viewing areas should be encouraged wherever appropriate and feasible. Paths, benches, and picnic areas should be located to take full advantage of marine views. The use of rooftop surfaces for open space and public recreation purposes should be considered.

6. Shoreline use and development activities should be oriented to take the greatest advantage of shoreline views. Buildings should be designed to provide maximum view opportunities from within. Shoreline use and development that are adjacent to pedestrian accessways should orient building facades to those pedestrian routes and utilize facade treatments that maximize the enjoyment of shoreline areas.

7. Building design details such as form, scale, proportion, color, materials and texture should be encouraged to be compatible within shoreline areas wherever feasible. Buildings should incorporate architectural features that reduce scale such as increased setbacks, building modulation (vertical and horizontal), pitched roofs, angled facades, and reduced massing.

8. Uniform and recognizable design and signage elements should be provided for in public access and recreational areas.

D. View and Aesthetic Regulations.

1. No permit shall be issued pursuant to this Shoreline Program for any new or expanded building or structure of more than 35 feet above average grade level that will obstruct the view of a substantial number of residences in areas adjoining such shorelines except where this Shoreline Program does not prohibit the same and then only when overriding considerations of the public interest will be served.

2. Private uninterrupted views of the shoreline, although considered during the review process, are not expressly protected. Property owners concerned with the protection of uninterrupted views from private property are encouraged to obtain view easements, purchase intervening property and/or seek other similar private means of minimizing view obstruction.

3. Public shoreline views shall be protected by the use of measures, including, but not limited to, maintaining open space between buildings, clustering buildings to allow for broader view corridors, and minimizing building height, building lot coverage and floor area ratios.

4. When there is an irreconcilable conflict between water-dependent uses and physical public access and maintenance of views from adjacent properties, the water-dependent uses and physical public access shall have priority, unless there is a compelling reason to the contrary.

5. Buildings for which a shoreline substantial development permit, conditional use permit, or variance is required shall incorporate architectural features that reduce scale such as increased setbacks, building modulation (vertical and horizontal), pitched roofs, angled facades, and reduced massing.

6. All signs shall be located in such a manner that they minimize interference with public views. Freestanding signs which may disrupt views to the water, excluding traffic control signs, directional, and incidental signs, shall be placed on the landward side of development.

7. Where lighted signs and illuminated areas are authorized, such illuminating devices shall be shaded and directed so as to minimize, to the extent feasible, the negative impact of light and glare on neighboring properties, streets, public areas or water bodies. Signage shall comply with the illumination standards specified in UPMC 19.75.070(A)(6).

8. New development, uses and activities shall locate and screen trash and recycling receptacles, utility boxes, HVAC systems, electrical transformers and other appurtenances to minimize interference with public views. Building mechanical equipment shall be incorporated into building architectural features, such as pitched roofs, to the maximum extent feasible. Where mechanical equipment cannot be incorporated into architectural features, a visual screen shall be provided consistent with building exterior materials that obstructs views of such equipment but not the shoreline.

9. Utilities and accessory structures shall be designed and installed in such a way as to avoid impacts to scenic views and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline area.

10. Communication and radio towers shall not obstruct or destroy scenic views of the water. This may be accomplished by design, orientation and location of the tower, height, camouflage of the tower, or other features consistent with utility technology and the standards contained in Chapter 23.45 UPMC.

11. Fences, walls, hedges and other similar accessory structures shall be limited to four feet in height within the required building setback area from the shoreline, measured landward from the ordinary high water mark, except as otherwise permitted under this Shoreline Program, so as to not preclude or significantly interfere with the public’s view of the water.

12. Protection and/or enhancement of critical areas and their associated buffers shall be preferred over provisions for visual access, when there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two.

13. View protection does not justify the excessive removal of vegetation to create views or enhance partial existing views. Retaining vegetation and “windowing” or other pruning techniques shall be preferred options over vegetation removal. Tree thinning to enhance views shall be in accordance with UPMC 18.25.100(F)(5).

14. New development shall be located and designed to mitigate adverse impacts to views from public vistas, viewpoints, parks and scenic drives.

15. View corridors, as specified in Table 18.30.B, shall be provided concurrent with any new use or development. Modifications to existing use or development shall preserve existing view corridors whether or not they fully comply with the standard listed in Table 18.30.B.

16. Structures are not permitted in any required view corridor, except that weather protection features, public art, and areas provided primarily for public access, such as pedestrian bridges, may be located in or over these areas.

17. Buildings for which a shoreline substantial development permit, conditional use permit, or variance is required, when located on or adjacent to the water, shall employ materials that minimize reflected light.

E. Regulations – Visual Impact Assessment.

1. The applicant of a building or structure in excess of 35 feet above average grade level shall prepare and submit a visual analysis in conjunction with any development permit. Rooftop mechanical equipment and other structures that exceed the height limit of the underlying zoning classification pursuant to UPMC 19.45.050(C) are exempt from the visual analysis requirement provided the width of the equipment or structure does not exceed 20 percent of the length of the roof section of the building on which it is located. At a minimum, the analysis shall include an assessment of the following factors:

a. The nature, significance, and extent of existing public shoreline views across the property to include:

(1) The number of points from which such views exist, and the size and location of each;

(2) The content and quality of the particular view available from each such point, to include any territorial components that may be an integral part of the view; and

(3) The extent to which any views might be obscured or lost by seasonal or other changes in existing or anticipated vegetation or by like development on other property in the immediate area.

b. The nature, significance, and extent of public shoreline view loss or gain that would likely result from the proposed development to include:

(1) The number of existing viewpoints that would be impacted and the extent of view loss reasonably anticipated for each;

(2) Whether or not any existing views will be enhanced or new viewpoints created by the project; and

(3) Whether or not it appears that there will be a net gain or net loss of public shoreline views.

c. The extent to which public shoreline views are already being preserved or enhanced by the owner’s election, for whatever reason, to propose less than the full measure of development rights available to the subject.

d. The extent to which development on other properties in the immediate area has already degraded or preserved public shoreline views.

e. The extent to which public shoreline views from residences will be enhanced, preserved or degraded.

2. In evaluating the significance of existing public shoreline views, the following shall apply:

a. Public shoreline views from streets, sidewalks, parks or other public property shall be presumed of greater value than public shoreline views from privately owned property.

b. Public shoreline views of greater expanse shall be presumed of more value than those of significantly lesser expanse.

c. Public shoreline views from traveled portions of streets, not including sidewalks, shall be presumed of lesser value than those from other public areas.

d. New developments subject to visual impact assessment that cause full loss of public views shall be required to provide publicly accessible viewpoint/platforms. Such structures shall be located, designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with UPMC 18.25.050.

3. If the proposed structure would block or significantly compromise the view of a substantial number of residences in adjoining areas, the Examiner may limit the height of the structure or require design revisions or relocation to prevent the loss of views.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.25.120 Water quality.

A. Intent and Applicability. Water quality is affected in numerous ways by human occupation and development of shoreline areas. Typically, the increase in impermeable surfaces as a result of development increases stormwater runoff volumes, causing higher stormwater discharges at higher velocities that cause scouring and erosion of stream banks. The degradation of water quality adversely affects wildlife habitat and public health. Policies and standards for managing water quality within shoreline jurisdiction are provided in this section.

B. Policies.

1. All shoreline uses and activities should be located, designed, constructed, and maintained to avoid significant ecological impacts that alter water quality, quantity, or hydrology.

2. The City should require reasonable setbacks, buffers, and stormwater management and encourage appropriate low-impact development techniques and materials to achieve the objective of lessening negative impacts on water quality.

3. Reasonable measures for controlling erosion, stream flow rates, or flood waters through the use of stream control works should be located, designed, constructed, and maintained so that net off-site impacts related to water do not degrade the existing water quality and quantity.

4. As a general policy, the City should seek to improve water quality, quantity, and flow characteristics in order to protect and restore ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes of shorelines within shoreline jurisdiction. The City should implement this policy through the regulation of development and activities, through the design of new public works, such as roads, drainage, and water treatment facilities, and through coordination with other local, State, and Federal water quality regulations and programs.

5. Measures to treat runoff in order to maintain or improve water quality should be conducted on site before shoreline development creates impacts to water.

6. Shoreline use and development should minimize the need for chemical fertilizers, pesticides or other similar chemical treatments to prevent contamination of surface and ground water and/or soils, and adverse effects on shoreline ecological functions and values.

7. New developments in the shoreline jurisdiction should connect to the sanitary sewer system in areas where sewer service is available in accordance with City and Pierce County sanitary sewer regulations.

C. Regulations.

1. New developments in the shoreline jurisdiction shall connect to the sanitary sewer system and are prohibited from installing an on-site sewage system unless Pierce County determines that a sanitary sewer connection is infeasible and the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department determines that an on-site sewage system may be designed and installed in accordance with the department’s regulations.

2. The City shall work cooperatively with Pierce County and the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department to identify and correct sanitary sewer system failures.

3. Stormwater management facilities for new uses and development shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NPDES permit requirements and the most current edition of the King County Surface Water Design Manual.

4. All shoreline development, both during and after construction, shall minimize impacts related to surface runoff through control, treatment and release of surface water runoff such that there is no net loss of receiving water quality in the shoreline environment. Control measures include but are not limited to runoff-intercepting ditches, catch basins, settling wet ponds, sedimentation ponds, oil/water separators, filtration systems, grassy swales, planted buffers, and fugitive dust controls. Regional or significant public control structures shall be placed outside of shoreline jurisdiction where feasible, and when such location is not feasible, such structure shall be placed outside of the minimum required building setback, where feasible.

5. Wood treated with creosote or pentachlorophenol may not be used in any hydraulic project. Wood treated with other preservatives may be used, provided it meets industry post-treatment standards and is sufficiently cured to minimize leaching into the water or bed.

6. All structures that come in contact with water shall be constructed of materials, such as wood, rock, concrete, approved plastic composites or steel that will not adversely affect water quality or aquatic plants or animals. Materials used for decking or other structural components shall be approved by applicable State agencies for contact with water to avoid discharge of pollutants from wave splash, rain or runoff.

7. The application of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and other chemicals that could adversely affect water quality is prohibited except for those chemicals specifically approved by the Department of Ecology for aquatic applications, aquatic uses and development.

18.30.010 Shoreline use and development – Intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to set forth policies and regulations for specific common uses and types of development that occur within University Place’s shoreline jurisdiction. Where a use is not listed in Table 18.30.A, the provisions of UPMC 18.15.060, Unclassified uses, shall apply in addition to the general provisions in this chapter. All uses and activities shall be consistent with the provisions of the shoreline environment designation in which they are located.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.30.020 General provisions.

A. Applicability. The provisions in this section apply to all uses and development types that may be allowed within the shoreline jurisdiction.

B. Policies.

1. The City should give preference to those uses that are consistent with the control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment, or are unique to or dependent upon uses of the State’s shoreline areas.

2. The City should ensure that all proposed shoreline development will not diminish the public’s health, safety, and welfare, as well as the land or its vegetation and wildlife, and should endeavor to protect property rights while implementing the policies of the Shoreline Management Act.

3. The City should reduce use conflicts by prohibiting or applying special conditions to those uses which are not consistent with the control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment or are not unique to or dependent upon use of the State’s shoreline. In implementing this provision, preference should be given first to water-dependent uses, then to water-related uses and water-enjoyment uses.

4. Proposed use of the shoreline should be consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan. Conversely, upland uses on adjacent lands outside of immediate SMA jurisdiction (in accordance with RCW 90.58.340) should be consistent with the purpose and intent of this Shoreline Program as they affect the shoreline.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.30.030 Regulations.

A. Developments that include a mix of water-oriented and non-water-oriented uses shall be considered water-oriented uses if the Administrator finds that the proposed development gives preference to uses that avoid impacts to shoreline ecological functions and processes, are dependent on a shoreline location, and enhance the public’s ability to enjoy the shoreline. Consistent with WAC 173-26-241(3)(d), commercial uses authorized as water-oriented shall incorporate appropriate design language and operational elements to meet such definition.

B. All uses not explicitly allowed in this Shoreline Program shall require a conditional use permit. The Hearing Examiner may impose conditions to ensure that the proposed development meets the policies of this Shoreline Program.

C. All development and uses must conform to all of the provisions of this Shoreline Program.

D. All development and uses shall conform to the shoreline use table and the development standards table in UPMC 18.30.040 unless otherwise stated.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.30.040 Use and development standards tables.

Tables 18.30.A and 18.30.B indicate the allowable uses and development standards for allowed uses or activities. These tables shall be used in conjunction with the written provisions for each use. Footnotes provide additional clarification or conditions applicable to the associated use or shoreline environment designation.

Notes for Table 18.30.B – Development Standards

1 = Where a structure is located within two or more environmental designations, each segment of the structure shall conform to the specific applicable limit.

2 = Height limits do not apply to structures and improvements listed as exceptions in UPMC 19.45.050(C).

3 = Some listed uses are not allowed as new uses in particular environment designations. See Table 18.30.A.

4 = See UPMC 18.25.110 regarding view protection requirements.

5 = Marinas and other facilities located upland of OHWM.

6 = Maximum height for properties located west of the centerline of the Day Island Waterway or within 100 feet of the OHWM.

7 = Maximum height for properties located both east of the centerline of the Day Island Waterway and more than 100 feet from the OHWM or when located on the upland (easterly) side of 91st Avenue West (see Figure 11 in UPMC 19.45.100), subject to approval of visual impact assessment, per UPMC 18.25.110(E).

8 = Day Island South Spit Overlay Zone height limit.

9 = Day Island and Sunset Beach height limit.

10 = For development located within the Chambers Creek Properties, see the Master Site Plan design standards and guidelines for specific limits.

11 = Overwater structure height may be limited for specific structures, per UPMC 18.35.050.

12 = Where no specific maximum height is indicated for a particular use within an environmental designation the “all others” use category shall apply. This may include institutional or recreational uses, depending on the project intent.

13 = Four to six du/acre density range based on R1 Day Island Overlay zoning for conventional SFD and small lot development; 30 to 35 du/acre density range based on MU-M zoning for multifamily development on the mainland side of the Day Island Waterway.

14 = Density range based on R1 zoning for conventional SFD and small lot development.

15 = Critical area standards in UPMC 17.15.055 require structures to provide geologic hazard buffers and buffer setbacks from the top of Chambers Creek Canyon slopes. Compliance with these standards would place new dwellings outside of the 150' VCA required in the Natural SED, and for most properties, the dwelling would be located outside of shoreline jurisdiction. No further subdivision allowed within shoreline jurisdiction.

16 = Calculations are based on upland area only. Submerged tidal lands are not included in calculations.

19 = Day Island lot coverage limit; impervious area may be increased to 40 percent by restoring or enhancing the VCA in accordance with UPMC 18.25.100. Day Island South Spit is exempt from lot coverage limits.

20 = Sunset Beach lot coverage limit; may be increased to 55 percent by restoring or enhancing native vegetation in an area equal to the additional impervious surface area above 50 percent, consistent with UPMC 18.25.100.

21 = Properties on Sunset Beach and Day Island South Spit are exempt from VCA requirements. Properties on Day Island that have an existing SFD located within 10 feet of the OHWM or have at least 50 percent of the VCA occupied by an existing SFD and other primary structures are exempt from VCA requirements.

22 = A view corridor of not less than 30 percent of the width of the property when viewed from the water and any upland street ROW shall be maintained between the abutting street and waterway. See Figure 8.

23 = Some uses listed are not allowed as new uses in particular environment designations. See Table 18.30.A.

24 = Trails and shared use pathways shall comply with UPMC 18.25.050(F).

25 = Boardwalks may be allowed over-water in the Day Island Medium Intensity shoreline environment, and within the Urban Conservancy and Natural shoreline environments when authorized in accordance with Chambers Creek Properties Master Site Plan (when applicable).

26 = Pedestrian crossings over the BNSF railroad ROW may be authorized at Sunset Beach.

27 = Pedestrian crossings over the BNSF railroad ROW may be authorized in accordance with the Chambers Creek Properties Master Site Plan.

28 = Pedestrian bridge crossings over Chambers Creek may be authorized where they provide an integral link for the Chambers-Leach Creek regional trail system and comply with UPMC 18.25.070(F).

29 = Applies to primary structures and accessory structures, except for those accessory structures listed in UPMC 18.30.130(C)(4) for which reduced setbacks may be authorized.

30 = Setbacks from OHWM for new construction and additions; existing lawfully established structures located closer to OHWM than specified setback shall be considered “conforming” structures. These may be expanded, provided all new building volume (vertical and horizontal) is located outside of the VCA and building setback.

31 = Setbacks from OHWM for new construction and additions; existing lawfully established structures located closer to OHWM than specified setback shall be considered “conforming” structures. These may be expanded provided dwelling floor area, including any attached structures such as garages, carports and the like, does not exceed 1,600 square feet inclusive of addition(s).

32 = Utilities may be allowed within setbacks where necessary to connect upland utility lines with in-water utility lines.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.30.050 Agriculture.

A. Applicability. Agriculture includes, but is not limited to, the commercial production of horticultural, viticultural, floricultural, dairy, apiary, vegetable, or animal products or of berries, grain, hay, straw, turf, seed, or Christmas trees not subject to the excise tax imposed by RCW 84.33.100 through 84.33.140; or livestock, that has long-term commercial significance as well as the other definitions of agricultural use found in WAC 173-26-020(3). In all cases, the use of agriculture-related terms shall be consistent with the specific meanings provided in WAC 173-26-020. There are no agricultural lands or operations within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction.

B. Policies.

1. Commercial agriculture is not compatible with the City’s shoreline environment designations.

2. New agricultural uses should be prohibited.

C. Regulations.

1. The creation or establishment of new agricultural land, operations or activities is prohibited.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.30.060 Aquaculture.

A. Applicability. Aquaculture is the farming or culturing of fish, shellfish or other aquatic plants and animals in lakes, streams, marine waters and other natural or artificial water bodies. Aquaculture does not include the harvest of wild geoduck associated with the State-managed wildstock geoduck fishery or activities on private property for personal consumption.

There are no aquaculture activities existing within the shoreline jurisdiction. Aquaculture activities are not anticipated to occur within shoreline jurisdiction; in the southern half of University Place, the sale for human consumption of commercial shellfish is currently prohibited by the State Department of Health.

B. Policies.

1. Some forms of aquaculture are dependent on the use of the water area; when consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the environment, water-dependent aquaculture is an acceptable use of the water area. Future aquaculture uses are not anticipated within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction; however, some scale or form of aquaculture may be appropriate in locations within the City of University Place.

2. Aquaculture related to the recovery of native populations should be encouraged.

3. Development of aquaculture facilities and associated activities should assure no net loss to shoreline ecological functions or processes. Aquaculture facilities should be designed and located so as not to spread disease to native aquatic life, establish new nonnative species which cause significant ecological impacts, or significantly impact the aesthetic qualities of the shoreline or views from upland properties.

4. The City may support aquaculture uses and developments that:

• Protect or improve water quality; and

• Avoid and minimize damage to forage fish spawning areas and important nearshore habitats such as eelgrass and macroalgae; and

• Minimize interference with navigation and normal public use of surface waters; and

• Minimize the potential for cumulative adverse impacts, such as those resulting from in-water structures/apparatus/equipment, land-based facilities, and substrate disturbance/modification (including rate, frequency and spatial extent).

5. Aquaculture use and development should locate in areas where biophysical conditions, such as tidal flow, currents, water temperature and depth, will minimize adverse impacts to shoreline ecological functions.

C. Regulations.

1. Aquaculture may be authorized when part of an approved restoration or habitat management plan and when it complies with the provisions of UPMC 18.25.070.

2. Aquaculture for the purpose of recovering native populations may be authorized when authorized by the Department of Fish and Wildlife and/or other State or Federal agencies having jurisdiction. Fish hatchery facilities are a permitted use in all shoreline environment designations when they comply with all other applicable provisions of this Program.

3. Commercial shellfish and net pen/finfish aquaculture is prohibited in the Natural designation. In all other instances, commercial aquaculture shall be a conditional use.

4. Commercial aquaculture involving development of mini-seed nurseries, including those which use FLUPSY2 technology, are limited in size to those which can be installed in a marina slip or within an existing boathouse. No more than 10 percent of the slips at a marina shall be occupied by commercial aquaculture to ensure conflicts with existing water-dependent recreational uses are minimized.

5. Commercial aquaculture is allowed as a conditional use as outlined in Table 18.30.A where it can be located, designed, constructed, and managed to avoid all of the following:

• A net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

• Spreading diseases to native aquatic life.

• Adversely impacting native eelgrasses and macroalgae species.

• Significantly conflicting with navigation and public access.

6. Aquaculture facilities shall identify and use best management practices to minimize impacts such as light and noise from the construction and management of the facilities.

7. New aquatic species that are not previously cultivated in Washington State shall not be introduced into City waters without prior written approval of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, including import and transport permits under WAC 220-76-100 and 220-72-076.

8. Aquaculture wastes shall be disposed of in a manner that will ensure compliance with all applicable governmental waste disposal standards, including but not limited to the Federal Clean Water Act, Section 401, and Chapter 90.48 RCW, Water Pollution Control. No garbage, wastes, or debris shall be allowed to accumulate at the site of any aquaculture operation.

9. The rights of treaty tribes to aquatic resources within their usual and accustomed areas shall be addressed through direct coordination between the project proponent and the affected tribe(s) through the permit review process.

10. Applicants shall include in their shoreline permit applications all information required by State and Federal permit applications for new and expanded aquaculture uses and development. Additional studies or information may be required by the City, which may include but are not limited to monitoring and adaptive management plans and information on ecological and visual impacts. For floating and above-water facilities, the City shall reserve the right to require that a visual impact analysis be conducted using a method approved by the City. Generally, the methods for identifying and analyzing potential visual and cumulative impacts will follow the principles in the Aquaculture Siting Study, Washington State Department of Ecology publication number 86-10-000 (October 1986).

11. Aquaculture structures and activities that are not water-dependent (e.g., warehouses for processing or storage of products and parking lots) shall be located landward of vegetation conservation areas and critical area buffers, and shall be located, designed and constructed to avoid and minimize detrimental adverse impacts to the shoreline.

12. Aquaculture activities and facilities shall be located where they do not adversely impact forage fish spawning areas, native eelgrass and microalgae species, or other critical saltwater habitats, priority species or species of concern, or habitat for such species as outlined in UPMC 18.25.070(D) and (E).

13. When a shoreline permit is issued for a new aquaculture use or development, that permit shall apply to the initial siting, construction, and planting or stocking of the facility or farm. Authorization to conduct such activities shall be valid for a period of five years with a possible extension. After the aquaculture use or development is established under the shoreline permit, continued operation of the use or development, including, but not limited to, maintenance, harvest, replanting, restocking or changing the culture technique or species cultivated shall not require a new, renewed or revised permit unless otherwise provided in the conditions of approval or this Program. Permit revisions shall proceed in accordance with WAC 173-27-100. Changing of the species cultivated shall be subject to applicable standards of this Program.

14. A new permit is required when:

a. The physical extent of the use or development or associated overwater coverage is expanded by more than 10 percent compared to the conditions that existed as of the effective date of this SMP. If the amount of expansion or change in overwater coverage exceeds 10 percent, the revision or sum of the revision and any previously approved revisions shall require that the applicant apply for a new permit; or

b. The use or development proposes to cultivate a species not previously cultivated within University Place’s jurisdictional waters; or

c. New chemicals not previously approved as part of the existing permit are proposed for use.

15. Floating/hanging aquaculture structures and associated equipment, except navigational aids, shall use colors and materials that blend into the surrounding environment in order to minimize visual impacts.

16. Aquaculture that involves significant risk of cumulative adverse effects on water quality, sediment quality, benthic and pelagic organisms, and/or wild fish populations through potential contribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or escapement of nonnative species, or other adverse effects on ESA-listed species shall not be permitted.

17. Additional standards for commercial geoduck aquaculture:

a. In addition to the standards above, commercial geoduck aquaculture shall only be allowed where sediments, topography, land and water access support geoduck aquaculture operations without significant clearing or grading.

b. All permits shall take into account that commercial geoduck operators have the right to harvest geoduck once planted.

c. All subsequent cycles of planting and harvest shall not require a new CUP, subject to WAC 173-27-100.

d. A single CUP may be submitted for multiple sites within an inlet, bay or other defined feature, provided the sites are all under control of the same applicant and within the Program’s jurisdiction.

e. Commercial geoduck aquaculture workers shall be allowed to accomplish on-site work during low tides, which may occur at night or on weekends. Where such activities are necessary, noise and light impacts to nearby residents shall be mitigated to the greatest extent practicable.

f. Where an applicant proposes to convert existing non-geoduck aquaculture to geoduck aquaculture, a conditional use permit shall be required.

g. In addition to the requirements in WAC 173-26-241(3)(b), proposals and applications for commercial geoduck aquaculture shall comply with and contain all of the items identified in WAC 173-26-241(3)(b)(iv).

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.30.070 Boating facilities.

A. Applicability. The University Place community has had a long and continuous history of investing in and utilizing boating facilities located in the vicinity of Day Island.

18.35.060    Restoration and enhancement.

18.35.070    Shoreline stabilization.

18.35.080    Breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs.


18.35.010 General provisions.

Shoreline modifications are structures or actions that permanently change the physical configuration or quality of the shoreline, particularly at the point where land and water meet. Shoreline modifications include, but are not limited to, structures such as dikes, breakwaters, piers, docks, weirs, dredge basins, fill, bulkheads, or other actions such as clearing, grading, application of chemicals, or vegetation removal. Generally, shoreline modifications are undertaken to prepare for a shoreline use, support an upland use, or to provide stabilization or defense from erosion.

Proposals for shoreline modifications are to be reviewed for compliance with the applicable use policies and regulations in Chapter 18.30 UPMC and the applicable modification policies and regulations of this chapter. Deviations from the minimum development standards may be approved under a shoreline variance unless specifically stated otherwise. Shoreline modifications listed as prohibited are not eligible for consideration as a shoreline variance.

A. General Policies.

1. All new development should be located and designed in a manner that prevents or minimizes the need for shoreline modifications.

2. Shoreline modifications should be regulated to assure that individually and cumulatively, the modifications do not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

3. Preference should be given to those types of shoreline modifications that have a lesser impact on ecological functions.

4. Compensatory mitigation of impacts resulting from shoreline modifications should be required.

5. The enhancement of impaired ecological functions should be planned for while accommodating authorized uses. All feasible measures to protect ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes should be incorporated in the placement and design of shoreline modifications. To avoid and reduce ecological impacts, mitigation sequencing set forth in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2) should be used.

B. Regulations.

1. Shoreline modifications that do not support an authorized shoreline use are not allowed by the Shoreline Program, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such activities are necessary and in the public interest for the maintenance of shoreline environmental resource values.

2. Shoreline modifications shall not result in the loss of shoreline ecological functions or ecosystem-wide processes. All proposals for shoreline modifications shall take measures to avoid or reduce ecological impacts in accordance with the mitigation sequencing priorities set forth in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2).

3. Shoreline modifications individually and cumulatively shall not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes. This shall be achieved by giving preference to those types of shoreline modifications that have a lesser impact on ecological functions and requiring mitigation of identified impact resulting from said modifications.

4. Shoreline modifications shall comply with critical area and vegetation conservation standards in this Shoreline Program.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).

18.35.050 Moorage – Moorage buoys, docks (piers, ramps and floats) and recreational floats.

A. Policies.

1. New moorage, excluding docks accessory to single-family residences, should be authorized only when it can be demonstrated that there is a specific need to support a water-dependent or public access use.

2. Moorage associated with a single-family residence is considered a water-dependent use, provided it is designed and used as a facility to access watercraft, and other moorage facilities are not available or feasible.

3. Moorage facilities should be allowed in the following order of preference:

a. Preference should be given to buoys over docks (piers, ramps and floats); however, the placement of moorage buoys should be discouraged where sufficient dock facilities exist; and

b. Preference should be given to shared moorage facilities over single-user moorage where feasible.

4. The cooperative use of moorage facilities should be encouraged. New residential development of two or more dwelling units or lots should provide joint use moorage facilities when access is provided.

D. Regulations – Residential Docks (Piers, Ramps and Floats).

1. Prior to approval of a residential dock (pier, ramp or float), the applicant shall demonstrate why the use of a moorage buoy or shared moorage is not feasible.

2. Where moorage is proposed for new subdivisions or residential development of two or more dwelling units, it shall be shared.

3. Shared moorage proposed for lease to upland property owners and serving five or more boats shall be reviewed as a boating facility in accordance with the provisions of UPMC 18.30.070.

4. To prevent the proliferation of moorage facilities, only one type of moorage facility shall be allowed per waterfront lot.

5. A new, joint use dock (pier, ramp or float) may be authorized on a community recreation lot shared by a number of waterfront or upland lots. Individual recreational floats (not for moorage) may be authorized subject to the requirements of subsection (G) of this section.

18.35.060 Restoration and enhancement.

Restoration is the reestablishment or upgrading of impaired ecological shoreline processes or functions. This may be accomplished through measures including, but not limited to, revegetation, removal of intrusive shoreline structures, and removal or treatment of toxic materials. Restoration does not imply a requirement for returning the shoreline area to aboriginal or pre-European settlement conditions.

Enhancement includes actions performed within an existing degraded shoreline, critical area and/or buffer to intentionally increase or augment one or more functions or values of the existing area. Enhancement actions include, but are not limited to, increasing plant diversity and cover, increasing wildlife habitat and structural complexity (snags, woody debris), installing environmentally compatible erosion controls, or removing nonindigenous plant or animal species.

Restoration and enhancement projects may include shoreline modification actions such as modification of vegetation, shoreline stabilization, dredging, and filling.

A. Policies.

1. Shoreline restoration and enhancement should be considered as an alternative to structural stabilization and protection measures where feasible.

2. All shoreline restoration and enhancement projects should protect the integrity of adjacent natural resources including aquatic habitats and water quality.

3. Restoration and enhancement projects should be designed, constructed, and maintained in keeping with restoration priorities and other policies and regulations set forth in UPMC 18.25.080.

4. Restoration and enhancement projects should be designed to minimize maintenance over time.

5. Fill associated with shoreline restoration and enhancement should not extend waterward more than necessary to achieve the intended results.

B. Regulations.

1. Shoreline restoration and enhancement may be authorized if the applicant demonstrates that no significant change to sediment transport will result and that the restoration or enhancement will not adversely affect shoreline ecological processes, water quality, properties, or habitat.

2. Shoreline restoration and enhancement projects shall use best available science and management practices. Restoration shall be carried out in accordance with the restoration framework principles and concepts contained within the City’s Restoration Plan and in accordance with the policies and regulations of this Shoreline Program.

3. Restoration and enhancement projects shall be designed to minimize maintenance over time.

4. Restoration and enhancement projects shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to avoid the use of shoreline stabilization measures. Where such measures cannot be avoided, bioengineering shall be used rather than bulkheads or other structural stabilization measures, unless it can be demonstrated that there are no feasible options to achieve the intended result. The primary purpose of restoration and enhancement projects including shoreline modification actions must clearly be restoration of the natural character and ecological functions of the shoreline. These projects must address legitimate restoration needs and priorities.

5. Fill for restoration and enhancement projects shall not extend waterward more than the minimum necessary to achieve the intended result and shall not result in the creation of additional upland area, to the extent feasible.

6. Restoration and enhancement projects shall not significantly interfere with the normal public use of the navigable waters of the State without appropriate mitigation.

7. Instream structures may be authorized only when necessary for a restoration or enhancement project, to improve fish passage, or for authorized road or utility crossings and subject to the following requirements:

a. Projects shall be evaluated for their potential adverse impacts upon the physical, hydrological, and biological characteristics as well as effects on instream/riparian habitat;

b. Instream structures and associated facilities shall be designed, constructed and maintained in a manner that will not degrade the quality of affected waters or instream/riparian habitat value, and minimizes adverse impacts to surrounding areas;

c. The location and design of instream structures shall give due consideration to the full range of public interests, watershed functions and processes, and environmental concerns, with special emphasis on protecting and restoring priority habitats and species;

d. Instream structures shall be designed based on an analysis of the reach or reaches to avoid the need for structural shoreline armoring; and

e. Instream structures and associated facilities shall provide for the protection and preservation of natural and cultural resources including, but not limited to, sensitive areas such as wetlands, waterfalls, erosion/accretion shore forms, and natural scenic vistas.

C. Shoreline Environment Regulations.

1. Restoration and enhancement projects that include shoreline modification actions may be authorized in all shoreline environments, provided:

a. The project’s primary purpose is the restoration of natural character and ecological functions of the shoreline; and

b. The project is consistent with the implementation of a comprehensive restoration plan approved by the City and/or Department of Ecology, or the Administrator finds that the project provides an ecological benefit and is consistent with this Shoreline Program.

(Ord. 652 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


18.35.070 Shoreline stabilization.

Shoreline stabilization includes actions taken to address erosion impacts to property, dwellings, businesses, or structures caused by natural processes such as current, flood, tides, wind, or wave action. These actions include structural and nonstructural methods.

Nonstructural methods include building setbacks, relocation of the structure to be protected, groundwater management, and planning and regulatory measures to avoid the need for structural stabilization.

Structural methods include “hard” and “soft” measures, defined as follows:

• Hard structural shoreline stabilization (also referred to as “hard” armoring) means erosion control measures using hardened structures that armor and stabilize the shoreline from further erosion. Examples of hard armoring include concrete, boulders, dimensional lumber or other materials to construct linear, vertical or near-vertical faces. These include bulkhead, rip-rap, groins, revetments, and similar structures.

• Soft structural shoreline stabilization (also referred to as “soft” armoring) means erosion control and restoration practices that rely on less rigid materials and may contribute to restoration, protection or enhancement of shoreline ecological functions. Examples of soft armoring include a mix of gravel, cobbles, boulders, logs and native vegetation placed to provide stability in a nonlinear, sloping arrangement.

Generally, the harder the construction measure the greater the impacts on shoreline processes and biological functions.

A. Policies.

1. Remaining unarmored shorelines should be preserved and the proliferation of bulkheads and other forms of shoreline armoring should be prevented.

2. New development requiring structural shoreline armoring should not be allowed. Shoreline use and development should be located and designed in a manner so that structural stabilization measures are not likely to become necessary in the future.

3. Structural shoreline armoring should only be authorized when there are no feasible alternatives, and when it can be demonstrated that it can be located, designed, and maintained in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on shoreline ecology and system-wide processes, including effects on the project site, adjacent properties, and sediment transport.

4. The reconstruction or expansion of existing hard armoring should only be authorized where necessary to protect an existing primary structure and land supporting this structure that is in danger of loss or substantial damage, and where mitigation of impacts would not cause a net loss of shoreline ecological functions and processes.

5. The removal of bulkheads and other hard armoring and the restoration of the shoreline to a more natural condition should be encouraged. Where stabilization is necessary for the protection of private property, alternative measures that are less harmful to shoreline ecological functions should be employed.

6. Nonstructural stabilization measures, including relocating structures, increasing buffers, enhancing vegetation, and managing drainage and runoff are preferred over structural shoreline armoring.

7. Failing, harmful, unnecessary, or ineffective structures should be removed. Shoreline ecological functions and processes should be restored using nonstructural methods.

8. Shoreline stabilization and shoreline armoring for the purpose of leveling or extending property, or creating residential lawns, yards, or landscaping should not be allowed.

9. Shoreline stabilization measures, individually or cumulatively, should not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or system-wide processes. Preference should be given to structural shoreline stabilization measures that have a lesser impact on ecological functions, and requiring mitigation of identified impacts resulting from said modifications.

10. The City should promote nonregulatory methods to protect, enhance, and restore shoreline ecological functions and other shoreline resources. Examples of such methods include public facility and resource planning, technical assistance, education, voluntary enhancement and restoration projects, land acquisition and restoration, and other incentive programs.

11. Publicly financed or subsidized shoreline erosion control measures should not restrict appropriate public access to the shoreline except where such access is determined to be infeasible because of incompatible uses, safety, security, or harm to ecological functions. Where feasible, ecological restoration and public access improvements should be incorporated into the project.

B. Regulations – New Development.

1. New shoreline use and development, including subdivision of land, shall be located and designed to eliminate the need for concurrent or future shoreline stabilization. If this is not feasible based upon a geotechnical analysis, soft structural protection measures shall be given preference over hard structural protection measures. The use of hard structural stabilization measures will only be allowed when it is demonstrated that soft structural measures are not feasible and that they will not result in significant impacts to adjacent or down-current properties.

2. Structural stabilization shall be located, designed, and constructed to minimize adverse impacts to shoreline ecological functions and processes. Protection of adjacent property and existing development shall also be considered in the design and location of structural stabilization measures.

3. Structural stabilization shall be located and designed in compliance with the vegetation conservation standards and critical area requirements in UPMC 18.25.100.

4. Structural shoreline stabilization measures to support new development will not be allowed unless all of the conditions below can be met:

a. The need to protect the development from damage due to erosion is demonstrated through a geotechnical report. For non-water-dependent development, including single-family residences, the damage must be caused by natural processes such as tidal action, currents, and waves;

b. The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions such as loss of vegetation and drainage;

c. Nonstructural measures such as placing the development further from the shoreline for non-water-dependent development, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements are not feasible or sufficient;

d. The structure will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or processes;

e. Impacts to sediment transport will be avoided or minimized;

f. The structure will not cause adverse impacts to adjacent or down-current properties and shoreline areas; and

g. Publicly financed or subsidized shoreline erosion control measures will not restrict appropriate public access to the shoreline except where such access is determined to be infeasible because of incompatible uses, safety, security, or harm to ecological functions. Where feasible, ecological restoration and public access improvements will be incorporated into the project.

5. New development on steep slopes or bluffs shall be set back so that shoreline stabilization will not be needed for the life of the structure.

C. Regulations – New or Expanded Shoreline Stabilization Measures.

1. New or enlarged structural stabilization measures are not allowed except where necessary to protect or support existing or approved development, for human safety, for restoration or enhancement activities, or remediation of contaminated sites.

2. Structural shoreline armoring for the sole purpose of leveling or extending property or creating residential lawns, yards, or landscaping is not allowed. Where hard shoreline armoring already exists, property owners are encouraged to remove it and replace with soft armoring, or if conditions allow, return the shoreline to a natural condition.

3. New or enlarged structural shoreline stabilization measures for an existing, lawfully established development or primary structure are not allowed unless there is conclusive evidence, documented by a geotechnical analysis, that the structure is in danger from shoreline erosion caused by currents, waves, or tidal action. In addition, all of the following provisions shall apply:

a. Normal sloughing, erosion of steep bluffs, or shoreline erosion itself, without a scientific or geotechnical analysis, is not a demonstration of need; the geotechnical analysis shall evaluate on-site drainage issues and address drainage problems away from the shoreline edge before considering structural shoreline stabilization;

b. The design of the stabilization structure shall take into consideration erosion rates, on-site drainage issues, vegetation enhancement, and low-impact development measures as a means of reducing erosion;

c. The shoreline stabilization measures shall be designed, located, sized, and constructed to assure no net loss of ecological functions; and

d. In geologically hazardous areas, new stabilization structures are allowed only where no alternatives, including relocation or reconstruction of existing structures, are feasible, and less expensive than the proposed stabilization measure, and then only if no net loss of ecological functions will result.

4. The use of hard structural stabilization measures, such as bulkheads, is not allowed unless demonstrated in a geotechnical analysis that soft structural stabilization measures (vegetation) or nonstructural measures (increased setbacks) are not effective.

5. Where structural shoreline stabilization measures are necessary, the size of the stabilization structure shall be the minimum necessary. The Administrator may require that the size and design of the structure be modified to reduce impacts upon shoreline ecology.

6. Where hard armoring measures are necessary, materials shall be used in the order of priority listed in subsection (E)(7) of this section.

7. Where adverse impacts to shoreline ecological functions cannot be avoided, mitigation shall be required in accordance with mitigation sequencing priorities set forth in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2).

8. In order to determine appropriate mitigation measures, the Administrator may require environmental information and analysis, including existing conditions, ecological functions and anticipated impacts, along with a vegetation management plan outlining how proposed mitigation measures would result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

9. Shoreline stabilization measures that incorporate ecological restoration or enhancement through the placement of rocks, sand or gravel, and native shoreline vegetation are strongly encouraged. Soft shoreline stabilization that restores ecological functions may be authorized waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

10. Following completion of shoreline modification activities, disturbed areas shall be restored in accordance with vegetation conservation measures set forth in UPMC 18.25.100.

D. Regulations – Replacement and Repair.

1. For purposes of this section, “replacement” means the construction of a new structure to perform a shoreline stabilization function of an existing structure which no longer adequately serves its purpose. Additions to or increase in size of existing shoreline stabilization measures shall be considered new structures.

2. An existing shoreline stabilization structure may be replaced with a similar functioning structure if there is a demonstrated need to protect principal uses or structures from erosion caused by currents, tidal action, or waves. If a primary structure is located less than 25 feet from the ordinary high water mark, the property owner/applicant is not required to demonstrate need.

3. The replacement structure shall be designed, located, sized, and constructed to assure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

4. Replacement walls or bulkheads shall not encroach waterward of the ordinary high water mark or existing structure unless there are overriding safety or environmental concerns. In such cases, the replacement structure shall abut the existing shoreline stabilization structure. Where a net loss of ecological function associated with critical saltwater habitats would occur by leaving the existing structure, it shall be removed as part of the replacement measure.

5. Soft shoreline stabilization measures that provide restoration or shoreline ecological functions may be authorized waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

E. Design of Shoreline Stabilization Measures.

1. Shoreline stabilization measures shall be designed by a State-licensed engineer and shall conform to all applicable City and State policies and regulations, including the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife criteria governing the design of bulkheads.

2. The size of shoreline stabilization structures shall be the minimum necessary to protect the primary use or structure.

3. To protect their structural integrity, shoreline stabilization measures shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to allow drainage of surface or groundwater away from the structures.

4. Shoreline stabilization structures shall be located to tie in flush with existing bulkheads on adjacent properties, except when adjoining bulkheads do not comply with the standards set forth in the Shoreline Program.

5. Stairs may be built as an integral component of a bulkhead but shall not extend waterward of the bulkhead unless necessary to access the shoreline or an over-water use or structure that is authorized under the Shoreline Program.

6. Materials used for shoreline stabilization structures shall be durable, erosion-resistant, and not harmful to the environment. The following materials shall be prohibited: demolition debris, derelict vehicles, tires, concrete rubble, or any other materials that contain toxic substances or create visual blight along the shoreline.

7. Where hard armoring is approved, materials shall be used in the following order of priority:

a. Large stones, with vegetation planted in the gaps. Stone should not be stacked any steeper than a 2:1 slope;

b. Timbers or logs that have not been treated with toxic materials;

c. Stacked masonry block;

d. Pre-cast or cast-in-place reinforced concrete.

Other materials approved for use by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Ecology, or other agency with jurisdiction may be used in lieu of the materials in subsections (E)(7)(a) through (d) of this section.

8. Bioengineering is a preferred method of protecting upland property and structures or to maintain access to an authorized shoreline use.

9. Bioengineering shall be used when a geotechnical analysis confirms a need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure, but the need is not as immediate as within three years.

10. Bioengineering projects shall incorporate all of the following:

a. All bioengineering projects shall use a diverse variety of native plant materials, including trees, shrubs, and grasses, unless demonstrated infeasible for the particular site;

b. All cleared areas shall be replanted following construction and irrigated (if necessary) to ensure that all vegetation is fully reestablished within three years. Areas that fail to adequately reestablish vegetation shall be replanted with approved plant materials until such time as the plantings are viable;

c. The VCA setback established in Table 18.30.B shall be managed to allow bank protection plantings to become established for a minimum of three years. The setback shall exclude vehicles and activities that could disturb the site. Pedestrian access to the shoreline may be authorized in accordance with UPMC 18.25.100(D)(1)(b);

d. All bioengineering projects shall be monitored and maintained as necessary. Areas damaged by pests and/or the elements shall be promptly repaired; and

e. All construction and planting activities shall be scheduled to minimize impacts to water quality, fish and wildlife, aquatic and upland habitat, and to optimize survival of new vegetation.

F. Required Reports.

1. Geotechnical reports prepared pursuant to this section that address the need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure shall address the necessity for shoreline stabilization by estimating time frames and rates of erosion and report on the urgency associated with the specific situation. As a general matter, hard armoring solutions should not be authorized except when a report confirms that there is a significant possibility that such a structure will be damaged within three years as a result of shoreline erosion in the absence of such hard armoring measures, or where waiting until the need is immediate, would foreclose the opportunity to use measures that avoid impacts on ecological functions.

2. Where the geotechnical report confirms a need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure, but the need is not as immediate as the three years, the report may still be used to justify more immediate authorization to protect against erosion using soft armoring.

G. Shoreline Environment Regulations.

1. Hard structural shoreline stabilization may be authorized with a shoreline conditional use permit in the Day Island Medium Intensity, Shoreline Residential, and Urban Conservancy shoreline environments. Hard structural shoreline stabilization is not allowed in the Natural shoreline environment.

2. Soft shoreline structural stabilization may be authorized in the Day Island Medium Intensity, Shoreline Residential, Urban Conservancy and Natural shoreline environments subject to the provisions of this Shoreline Program.

3. Normal repair and maintenance of existing shoreline stabilization may be authorized in the Day Island Medium Intensity, Shoreline Residential, Urban Conservancy and Natural shoreline environments subject to the provisions of this Shoreline Program.

1. Jetties, breakwaters, groin systems or weirs should not be authorized unless no other practical alternative exists. If allowed, they should be located, designed, and maintained to avoid, then minimize, impacts to shoreline ecological functions and system-wide processes.

2. Existing private residential groins are critical structures for stabilizing shoreline areas at Sunset Beach and along the west side of Day Island. Maintenance and repair of these groins is supported in accordance with subsections (B) and (C) of this section.

B. Regulations – General.

1. Jetties and breakwaters are not allowed except as an integral component of a water- dependent use such as marina, and only when there is a documented need for the protection of navigation, water-dependent uses, public access, fisheries or habitat enhancement project, or a comprehensive beach management plan or other specific public purpose.

2. Where authorized, floating, portable, or submerged breakwater structures, or smaller discontinuous structures, shall be used only when it has been demonstrated that they will not impact shoreline ecology or processes such as littoral drift or cause erosion of down-drift beaches.

3. The location and design of breakwaters, jetties, groins, and weirs shall be subject to mitigation sequencing outlined in UPMC 18.25.070(C)(2).

4. The design of breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs shall conform to all applicable requirements established by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

5. The design of breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs shall be certified by a registered civil engineer.

6. Breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs shall not intrude into critical salt water habitats, salmon and steelhead habitats, or critical areas unless the following conditions are met:

a. An alternative location or alignment is not feasible;

b. The project is designed to minimize its impacts on critical salt water habitats and the environment;

c. All adverse impacts will be mitigated;

d. The project, including any required mitigation, will result in no net loss of ecological functions associated with the critical salt water habitat;

e. The facility is in the public interest and consistent with the State’s interest in resource protection and species recovery; and

f. If the project results in significant unavoidable adverse impacts, the impacts are mitigated by creating in-kind replacement habitat near the project. Where in-kind replacement mitigation is not feasible, rehabilitating degraded habitat may be required as a substitute.

7. Breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs shall be constructed of suitable materials. The use of solid waste, junk or abandoned automobiles, asphalt or any building demolition debris is not allowed.

8. The movement of sand and beach materials resulting from breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs shall be evaluated as a part of the permit review. Those projects which are found to block littoral drift or cause new erosion of down-drift shoreline shall be required to establish and maintain an adequate long-term beach feeding program. This may include artificially transporting sand to the down-drift side of an inlet with jetties, or artificial beach feeding in the case of breakwaters, groins, and weirs.

9. Breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs shall incorporate provisions for public access except where such structures are intended to protect existing single-family residences.

C. Regulations – Maintenance and Repair.

1. Maintenance and repair work shall comply with the general regulations provided in UPMC 18.35.080(B). An existing structure may be replaced with a similar structure if there is a demonstrated need to protect primary uses or structures from erosion caused by currents, tidal action, or waves. If a primary structure is located less than 25 feet from the ordinary high water mark, the property owner/applicant is not required to demonstrate there is a need for the maintenance or repair. For properties where the primary structure(s) are located more than 25 feet from the ordinary high water mark, the owner/applicant will need to demonstrate there is a need for the proposed maintenance or repair.

2. The replacement structure shall be designed, located, sized, and constructed to assure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

D. Shoreline Environment Regulations.

1. New breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs are not allowed in the Natural shoreline environment designation.

2. New breakwaters, jetties, and weirs may be authorized in the Marine Deepwater, Urban Conservancy, Shoreline Residential, and Day Island Medium Intensity shoreline environments subject to a shoreline conditional use permit. New groins are allowed in the Marine Deepwater, Urban Conservancy, Shoreline Residential, and Day Island Medium Intensity shoreline environments only when necessary to support specific public purposes such as water-dependent uses, public access or public shoreline stabilization. New private groins are prohibited in all shoreline environments.

3. Maintenance and repair of existing breakwaters, jetties, groins and weirs may be authorized in the Marine Deepwater, Natural, Urban Conservancy, Shoreline Residential, and Day Island Medium Intensity shoreline environments subject to the provisions of this Shoreline Program.

19.20.030 Zones.

A. Purpose. The purpose of zones is to divide the City into areas or zones to achieve the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. Foremost amongst the goals of the City’s Comprehensive Plan is to protect residential areas from incompatible land uses, encourage economic development, protect the environment, maintain the City’s character, and improve and maintain quality of life. Zones separate or combine various land uses, help maintain property values, protect public health, safety and welfare and aid in City administration. Use, density, building height, setbacks and sign types are examples of land uses regulated by zone.

B. Zones.

1. Residential 1 (R1). Single-family neighborhoods comprise a large percentage of the City’s land area. Consistent with community preferences, protection of single-family residential neighborhoods is a priority in the Comprehensive Plan. To protect and enhance the character of these neighborhoods, properties within them are zoned R1. A base density of four dwelling units per acre is allowed, with up to six units per acre permitted for small lot development through the administrative design review process, when designed consistent with the small lot design standards and guidelines adopted by reference in Chapter 19.53 UPMC. These standards and guidelines are intended to ensure that new development is integrated into the community and compatible with the surrounding context while providing functional, safe, vibrant and desirable neighborhoods. Duplexes may be developed at a base density of five dwelling units per acre. Uses allowed include attached and detached single-family/duplex housing, small lot housing, attached and detached accessory dwelling units, adult family homes, Level I group homes, schools, public parks, community and cultural services, family day care, religious assembly, appropriate home occupations, and minor utility distribution facilities. The character of R1 neighborhoods shall be protected and enhanced by eliminating and disallowing inappropriate uses; limiting traffic impacts; requiring compliance with screening, buffering and other design standards for adjacent high density residential, commercial, mixed use and industrial development; preserving and protecting the physical environment; and providing interconnecting pedestrian and bicycle facilities, including sidewalks and trails to schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

2. Residential 2 (R2). To achieve a mix of housing types and densities while maintaining healthy residential neighborhoods, the R2 classification applies to areas that have developed with a mix of single-family attached and detached housing. A base density of six dwelling units per acre is allowed, with up to nine units per acre permitted for small lot development through the administrative design review process, when designed consistent with the small lot design standards and guidelines adopted by reference in Chapter 19.53 UPMC. These standards and guidelines are intended to ensure that new development is integrated into the community and compatible with the surrounding context while providing functional, safe, vibrant and desirable neighborhoods. Uses allowed include attached and detached single-family/duplex housing, small lot housing, attached and detached accessory dwelling units, adult family homes, Level I group homes, schools, family day care, assisted living and nursing homes, religious assembly, public parks, community and cultural services, appropriate home occupations, and minor utility distribution facilities. The character of these neighborhoods shall be preserved and enhanced by eliminating and disallowing inappropriate uses; limiting traffic impacts; requiring compliance with screening, buffering and other design standards for adjacent high density residential, commercial, mixed use and industrial development; preserving and protecting the physical environment; providing opportunities for a wide range of high quality housing choices; and providing interconnecting pedestrian and bicycle facilities, including sidewalks and trails to schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

3. Multifamily Residential – Low (MF-L). Multifamily Residential – Low zones are located along major arterials and transit routes, close to shopping, public facilities and services, and in areas of existing lower density residential development. In the MF-L zone, a base density of 35 dwelling units per acre is allowed through the administrative design review process, when a project is designed consistent with the multifamily design standards and guidelines adopted by reference in Chapter 19.53 UPMC. Density may be increased to a maximum of 40 units per acre when an affordable housing component is included in a development. Uses allowed in the MF-L zone include multifamily housing, attached and detached single-family/duplex housing, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, mobile and manufactured housing, adult family homes, Level I group homes, schools, public and private parks, community and cultural services, family day care, religious assembly, appropriate home occupations, and minor utility distribution facilities. Compliance with design standards is required and screening, buffers, open space, landscaping, and other design elements shall be incorporated into all development to mitigate adverse impacts that may be associated with the transition between different densities and land uses. Pedestrian sidewalks, trails and bicycle facilities shall be provided for access to schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

4. Multifamily Residential – High (MF-H). Multifamily Residential – High zones are located along major arterials and transit routes, close to shopping, public facilities and services, and in areas of existing higher density residential development. In the MF-H zone, a base density of 55 dwelling units per acre is allowed through the administrative design review process, when a project is designed consistent with the multifamily design standards and guidelines adopted by reference in Chapter 19.53 UPMC. Density may be increased to a maximum of 60 units per acre when an affordable housing component is included in a development. Uses allowed in the MF-H zone include multifamily housing, attached and detached single-family/duplex housing, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, mobile and manufactured housing, adult family homes, Level I group homes, schools, public and private parks, community and cultural services, family day care, religious assembly, appropriate home occupations, and minor utility distribution facilities. Compliance with design standards is required and screening, buffers, open space, landscaping, and other design elements shall be incorporated into all development to mitigate adverse impacts that may be associated with the transition between different densities and land uses. Pedestrian sidewalks, trails and bicycle facilities shall be provided for access to schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

5. Mixed Use – Office (MU-O). It is the City’s intent to create a well-balanced, well-organized combination of land uses that recognizes historic development patterns, protects adjoining residential neighborhoods from incompatible uses, and discourages a continuous retail strip along Bridgeport Way. The MU-O classification serves as a transition zone providing separation between more intense commercial activities and residential areas, and between the Neighborhood Commercial area at 27th Street West and Bridgeport Way, and the Village at Chambers Bay beginning at 35th Street West and Bridgeport Way. A base density of 60 dwelling units per acre is allowed through the administrative design review process, when a project is designed consistent with the design standards adopted by reference in Chapter 19.50 UPMC. Density may be increased to a maximum of 65 units per acre when an affordable housing component is included in a development. Uses allowed include multifamily housing, attached single-family housing, adult family homes, Level I group homes, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, day care, religious assembly, professional offices, limited retail uses, public parks, community and cultural services, administrative government services, and minor utility distribution facilities. New multifamily will be allowed only in conjunction with other permitted commercial uses. Screening, buffers, landscaping, and other design elements shall be incorporated into all development to mitigate adverse impacts that may be associated with the transition between different densities and land uses. Sidewalks and public open spaces shall be provided to encourage a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere and connections with transit stops, schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

6. Mixed Use (MU). The MU classification applies to an area of compatible residential and commercial uses along arterial streets and provides a transition between the more intense Town Center (TC) zone and the R1 zone. The historic commercial center of University Place along 27th Street West, west of Bridgeport Way, is the primary MU area. A base density of 45 dwelling units per acre is allowed through the administrative design review process, when a project is designed consistent with the design standards adopted by reference in Chapter 19.50 UPMC. Density may be increased to a maximum of 50 units per acre when an affordable housing component is included in a development. MU areas located outside of the 27th Street West corridor west of Bridgeport Way may be developed to a higher base density of 60 dwelling units per acre and a maximum of 65 units per acre when an affordable housing component is included in a development. Uses allowed include multifamily housing, attached single-family housing, adult family homes, Level I group homes, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, day care, religious assembly, professional offices, general retail, personal services, restaurants, small food stores, lodging, family entertainment businesses, public and private parks, community and cultural services, administrative government and safety services, and minor utility distribution facilities. Developments that include a mix of retail, personal services, offices, and residential uses are encouraged. New multifamily will be allowed only in conjunction with other permitted commercial uses. Screening, buffers, landscaping, and other design elements shall be incorporated into all developments to mitigate adverse impacts that may be associated with the transition between different densities and land uses. Sidewalks, bicycle facilities, and public open spaces shall be provided to encourage a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere and connections with transit stops, schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

7. Neighborhood Commercial (NC). To help achieve a mix of commercial uses that primarily serves the needs of local residents and businesses, NC classifications apply to the intersections of 27th Street West and Bridgeport Way, Cirque Drive and Bridgeport Way, 67th Avenue West and Bridgeport Way, and Cirque Drive and Orchard Street. Specific restrictions apply to the 67th Avenue West and Bridgeport Way area that prohibit 24-hour business operations and fueling stations, limit vehicular site access, and require screening and buffering between this area and nearby residential properties. The NC areas are compact centers that provide a mix of neighborhood scale retail shopping, personal services, banks, professional offices, public parks, community and cultural services, administrative government and safety services, and service stations that serve the daily needs of the portion of the City where they are located. Residential development is limited to adult family homes, bed and breakfasts, and attached single-family housing. Screening, buffers, landscaping, and other design elements shall be incorporated into all development to mitigate adverse impacts that may be associated with the transition between the NC zones and adjoining residential zones. Landscaping, sidewalks and public open spaces shall be provided to encourage a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.

8. Town Center (TC). The Town Center serves as a focal point for the City and provides a sense of community and civic pride. The TC zone is centered on Bridgeport Way between 35th Street West and the 3800 block. The Town Center is a pedestrian-oriented area. Wide sidewalks, pedestrian connections to adjacent residential areas, landscaping, public open spaces, and public art are an integral part of the Town Center. Public facilities in the Town Center include the Civic Building, which houses the University Place branch library, police headquarters and other City offices, City Hall at Windmill Village, West Pierce Fire and Rescue facilities, and Homestead Park. Public facilities and services, retail stores, personal services, professional offices, restaurants, and some entertainment uses are encouraged to locate in the Village at Chambers Bay, which comprises a significant portion of the Town Center area. The TC zone requires a minimum density of 20 units per acre, has no maximum density, and requires projects to be designed consistent with the design standards adopted by reference in Chapter 19.52 UPMC. An overall maximum floor area ratio of 2.0 accommodates a relatively high intensity of use and development. New multifamily development will be allowed only when specific design standards are met, when additional amenities are provided, and when built in conjunction with a permitted commercial use. Design standards for new development, major redevelopment and major tenant improvements and public/private development partnerships help promote a dynamic economy and healthy community.

9. Community Commercial (CC). The CC zone is centered on Bridgeport Way between the 3800 block and 44th Street West. This area is slated to become increasingly pedestrian-oriented with redevelopment over time. Uses allowed include adult family homes, Level I group homes, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, day care, religious assembly, professional offices, general retail, personal services, restaurants, food stores, lodging, public and private parks, community and cultural services, administrative government services, and minor utility distribution facilities. Developments that include a mix of retail, personal services, offices, and residential uses are encouraged. New multifamily will be allowed only in conjunction with other permitted commercial uses. A base density of 60 dwelling units per acre is allowed when a project is designed consistent with the design standards adopted by reference in Chapter 19.52 UPMC. Density may be increased to a maximum of 65 units per acre when an affordable housing component is included in a development. Buffers, landscaping, and other design elements shall be incorporated into all developments to mitigate adverse impacts that may be associated with the transition between different densities and land uses. Sidewalks, bicycle facilities, and public open spaces shall be provided to encourage a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere and connections with transit stops, schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

10. Light Industrial – Business Park (LI-BP). The primary LI-BP area, which has historically been used for light manufacturing and light industrial uses, is located south of 27th Street West between Morrison Road on the west, 67th Avenue on the east, and Morrison Pond on the south. Additional light industrial and business park uses are located along the east side of 70th Avenue West north of 27th Avenue West. The LI-BP classification recognizes many of the existing uses in these areas as appropriate, while maintaining a separation of these uses from adjoining residential uses. Uses allowed in the LI-BP zone include light and clean industries, storage and warehousing, automotive repair, contractor yards, limited retail, restaurants, offices, and entertainment uses, parks, community and cultural services, administrative government and safety services, utility and public maintenance facilities, and public transportation services. Inappropriate uses that have a high potential to impact nearby residential and mixed use areas will be disallowed or eliminated over time. Development and redevelopment in the LI-BP zone shall include features such as sidewalks, bicycle facilities, open space, landscaping, functional and attractive signage, traffic control and privately coordinated management and maintenance. Buffers and design elements shall be incorporated into all new developments and substantial redevelopments to mitigate adverse impacts that may be associated with the transition to adjacent zones and land uses.

11. Parks and Open Space (POS). The purpose of the Parks and Open Space zone is to recognize those lands designated for City parks and public open space. Parks include developed City parks where typical uses include active and passive outdoor recreational activities, including but not limited to ball fields, sport courts, tot lots, trails, open space, and cultural activities. Park buildings and structures, concessionaires, general park operations and maintenance activities, storm drainage facilities, caretaker’s quarters, other compatible public uses and structures, and uses customarily incidental to parks are also allowed.

Open space includes undeveloped City park lands and critical areas such as wetlands, steep slopes, and stream corridors owned by the City. Until developed as park land, uses in these areas should be low impact, low intensity uses such as permanent open space, passive hiking trails, and passive interpretative trails.

12. Mixed Use – Maritime (MU-M). The Mixed Use – Maritime zone is intended to accommodate: marinas, yacht clubs with boat moorage and related facilities and activities, and other boating facilities. The MU-M zone is also intended to accommodate mixed use development that may include a variety of water-oriented commercial, transportation and light industrial uses, and moderate density residential uses, located in the vicinity of Day Island. A base density of 30 dwelling units per acre is allowed when a project is designed consistent with the design standards adopted by reference in Chapter 19.50 UPMC. Density may be increased to a maximum of 35 units per acre when an affordable housing component is included in a development. Additional purposes are to provide public access to the shoreline and recreational uses oriented toward the waterfront, and to accommodate non-water-oriented uses on a limited basis where appropriate. Under the MU-M zone, existing ecological functions are to be protected and ecological functions restored, where restoration is reasonably feasible, in areas that have been previously degraded, consistent with the intent of the Day Island Medium Intensity Shoreline Environment and other Shoreline Master Program requirements in UPMC Title 18, when applicable.

19.20.040 Overlay zones.

A. Purpose. The purpose of an “overlay zone” is to identify areas where uses allowed in the underlying zone are permitted subject to special regulatory standards to achieve the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. This is accomplished by establishing overlay zones with special or alternative standards as designated by the City’s Comprehensive Plan and this code.

B. Overlay Zones.

1. Public Facility Overlay (PFO). The public facility overlay (PFO) designation includes properties currently owned or operated by a public entity. Uses in the public facility overlay include but are not limited to fire district and school district properties. The purpose of the public facility overlay is to recognize that public facilities provide necessary services to the community and have their own unique set of circumstances. Factors including size, technological processes, requirements for municipal comprehensive facility planning and budgeting, capital improvement programs, and compatibility with surrounding land uses must be considered when developing public facilities. New, improved and redeveloped public facilities should incorporate buffers and landscaping into their plans to ensure compatibility with adjacent land uses and zones. Sidewalks, open public spaces and public art shall be provided to encourage a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere and connections with public transit stops, schools, shopping, services, and recreational facilities.

2. Chambers Creek Properties Overlay (CCPO). The Chambers Creek properties overlay is an area of land located in the southwest corner of the City that is owned by Pierce County. This property consists of a total of 930 acres with about 700 acres situated in the City. A master plan was developed over several years with the help of area residents, and was originally adopted by Pierce County and the City in 1997 with an update in 2005. In accordance with the Chambers Creek properties master site plan, the “properties,” as they are referred to by Pierce County, are currently developed with a mix of public facilities and services including the County’s principal wastewater treatment facility, the County’s Environmental Services Building, active and passive open spaces including Chambers Bay, an 18-hole links style golf course, ball fields, open meadows and an extensive trail system. Future development includes restaurants, a golf club house, lodging, a boat launch, more trails and an off-leash dog area. The development of the Chambers Creek properties is subject to a joint procedural agreement and design standards aimed at achieving County and City goals and promoting economic development.

3. Day Island/Day Island South Spit/Sunset Beach Overlay (DIO/DISSO/SBO). The purpose of the Day Island/Day Island South Spit/Sunset Beach overlay areas is to preserve the unique residential character of Day Island and Sunset Beach by recognizing and preserving historic development patterns. The Day Island Overlay also supports continued marina operations at the north end of Day Island. Many houses on Day Island and Sunset Beach were built with different building setbacks than current codes allow. There are also numerous encroachments on the public right-of-way, which should be corrected over time. A special set of development standards applies in this area to achieve its purpose.

4. Transition Properties Overlays (TPO). The purpose of transition properties overlays is to create a uniform set of design standards aimed at protecting single-family neighborhoods that abut commercial areas, and therefore need extra protection not provided by other standards due to unique circumstances. Four special protection areas have been identified by the City Council including Westwood Square, Menlo Park (two areas), and 28th Street. Design standards for these areas include limits on access, additional buffering and/or setback requirements, building modulation, and location of windows.

19.20.050 Zoning map.

Map Established. The official zoning map used as a basis for this zoning regulation shall be maintained by the Department and shall be that map entitled “City of University Place Zoning Map.” Each property in the City of University Place is classified under this code and is subject to the requirements of this code. Zoning classifications on the official zoning map shall use the symbols shown in UPMC 19.20.020, List of zones.

(Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 589 §1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 514 § 1, 2008; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 423 § 60, 2004; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.20.060 Interpretation of boundaries.

A. Interpretation of Boundaries. When uncertainty regarding zone classification boundaries arises, the following rules of interpretation shall apply:

1. Where zoning boundaries are indicated as following the centerline of streets, alleys or highways, the centerline shall be the boundary.

2. Where zoning boundaries do not show a zoning designation extending into a public right-of-way, alley, private road, railroad right-of-way, or other easement, the zone boundary and designation immediately abutting shall extend to the center of the right-of-way, alley, road, or easement. It is the intent of this statement that all lands in the City are zoned and are subject to the provisions of this title.

3. Where zoning boundaries are indicated as following lot or tract lines, the lot or tract lines shall be the boundary.

4. Shorelands shall be considered to be within the same zone as the abutting upland.

5. Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the zone classification applicable to the property abutting the vacated portion shall apply to the vacated or abandoned street or alley.

6. Where zoning boundaries divide a parcel created prior to August 31, 1995, the entire parcel shall be considered to be within the classification of the majority of the parcel, i.e., the portion which is greater than 50 percent of the lot area.

7. Where these rules do not clarify a boundary issue, the Director shall make the determination. The Director’s determination in these instances may be appealed according to UPMC Title 22, Administration of Development Regulations.

4. The building permit shall be valid until a permanent housing unit is incorporated into the public facility; at such time, the temporary unit shall be removed.

C. The Director may authorize a mobile or manufactured home as caretaker quarters in commercial and industrial zones subject to the following:

1. The initial approval of such caretaker’s quarters shall be for no more than one year.

In the event the Health Department requires the installation of separate water supply and/or sewerage disposal systems, said requirements shall not at a later time constitute grounds for the continuance or permanent location of a temporary housing unit beyond the length of time authorized in the permit or renewal of said permit.

3. Temporary housing units having a width in excess of 14 feet shall be permitted only on lots or tracts of land having a total area of one acre or more.

4. The temporary housing unit shall not be located in any required yard or open space required by this code nor shall the unit be located closer than 20 feet nor more than 100 feet from the principal dwelling on the same lot.

5. In the event the site contains trees or other natural vegetation of a type and quantity to make it possible to partially or totally provide screening on one or more sides of the temporary housing unit, the Director may require the temporary housing unit to be located so as to take advantage of the natural growing material available on the site to screen said unit from abutting property.

6. Prior to the issuance of a temporary housing permit, the City shall review the application and may require the installation of such fire protection/detection equipment as may be deemed necessary as a condition to the issuance of the temporary housing permit.

C. A six-foot-tall sight-obscuring fencing is required around the perimeter of the encampment; provided, that the fencing does not create a sight obstruction at the street or street intersections or curbs as determined by the City engineer, unless the Director determines that there is sufficient vegetation, topographic variation, or other site condition such that fencing would not be needed.

D. Exterior lighting must be directed downward and glare contained within the temporary tent encampment.

E. The maximum number of residents at a temporary tent encampment site shall be determined by the Director taking into consideration site conditions, but in no case shall the number be greater than 100 people.

F. On-site parking of the sponsor shall not be displaced unless sufficient required off-street parking remains available for the host’s use to compensate for the loss of on-site parking or unless a shared parking agreement is executed with adjacent properties.

G. A transportation plan must be developed which includes parking plan for encampment residents and transit services.

H. No children under 18 are allowed to stay overnight in the temporary tent encampment, unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. If a child under the age of 18 without a parent or guardian present attempts to stay at the encampment, the sponsor and the managing agency shall immediately contact Child Protective Services and shall actively endeavor to find alternative shelter for the child.

I. The sponsor or managing agency shall provide and enforce a written code of conduct, which not only provides for the health, safety and welfare of the temporary tent encampment resident, but also mitigates impacts to neighbors and the community. A copy of the code of conduct shall be submitted to the City at the time of application for the temporary use permit. Said code shall be incorporated into the conditions of approval.

J. The sponsor and the managing agency shall ensure compliance with Washington State laws and regulations, the City Municipal Code, and local health district concerning, but not limited to, drinking water connections, solid waste disposal, human waste, electrical systems and storm water quality. The sponsor and the managing agency shall permit inspections by State and/or local agencies and/or Departments to ensure such compliance and shall implement all directives resulting within the specified time period.

K. Building and/or fire permits may be required depending on the type, size, location or use of existing buildings, tents or other temporary structures. ADA facilities may be required.

L. The sponsor and managing agency shall assure all applicable public health regulations, including but not limited to the following, will be met at/for:

1. Sanitary portable toilets, which shall be set back at least 40 feet from all property lines;

2. Hand-washing stations by the toilets and food preparation areas;

3. Food preparation or service tents; and

4. Refuse and recycling receptacles.

M. Public health guidelines on food donations and food handling and storage, including proper temperature control, shall be followed and homeless encampment residences involved in food donations and storages shall be made aware of these guidelines consistent with the local health district requirements.

N. The sponsor and the managing agency shall designate points of contact for the City Police Department. At least one designated point of contact shall be on duty at all times. The names of the on-duty points of contact shall be posted on-site daily and their contact information shall be provided to the City Police Department.

O. Facilities for dealing with trash shall be provided on site throughout the encampment. A regular trash patrol in the immediate vicinity of the temporary tent encampment site shall be provided.

P. The sponsor and the managing agency shall take all reasonable and legal steps to obtain verifiable identification from current and prospective encampment residents and use the identification to obtain sex offender and warrant checks from appropriate agencies. The sponsor and the managing agency shall keep a log of names and dates of all people who stay overnight in the temporary tent encampment.

Q. The sponsor and the managing agency shall immediately contact the City Police Department if someone is rejected or ejected from the encampment when the reason for rejection or ejection is an active warrant or a match on a sex offender check, or if, in the opinion of the on-duty point of contact or on-duty security staff, the rejected/ejected person is a potential threat to the community.

R. Tents over 300 square feet in size and canopies in excess of 400 square feet shall utilize flame retardant materials.

S. The sponsor, the managing agency and temporary tent encampment residents shall cooperate with other providers of shelters and services for homeless persons within the City and shall make inquiry with these providers regarding the availability of existing resources.

(Ord. 609 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012).


19.36.040 Frequency and duration of temporary use.

The Director shall not grant a permit for the same site more than once in any calendar year; provided, that the Director is not authorized to issue a permit for the same site sooner than 180 days from the date the site is vacated as provided in UPMC 19.36.030(T). Temporary tent encampments may be approved for a period not to exceed 90 days. The permit shall specify a date by which the use shall be terminated and the site vacated and restored to its pre-encampment condition.

(Ord. 609 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012).


19.36.050 Permit required.

Establishment of a temporary tent encampment shall require approval of a temporary use permit, as described in this chapter, and compliance with all other applicable City regulations. The Director shall have authority to grant, grant with conditions or deny an application for a temporary use permit under this chapter; provided that the Director shall have no authority to modify the limits established in UPMC 19.36.040.

(Ord. 609 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012).


19.36.060 Application.

Application for a temporary use permit shall be made on forms prescribed by the City, and shall be accompanied by a fee established in the City’s current fee resolution and the following information; provided, that the Director may waive any of these items, pursuant to UPMC 22.05.050(F), upon request by the applicant and finding that the item is not necessary to analyze the application. An application to establish a temporary tent encampment shall be signed by both the sponsor and the managing agency (“applicant”).

A. A site plan of the property, drawn to scale, showing existing natural features, existing and proposed grades, existing and proposed utility improvements, existing rights-of-way and improvements, and existing and proposed structures, tents and other improvements (including landscaping and fencing at the perimeter of the proposed encampment and the property and off-street parking);

B. A vicinity map, showing the location of the site in relation to nearby streets and properties;

C. A written summary of the proposal, responding to the standards and requirements of this chapter;

D. The written code of conduct and a transportation plan as required by this chapter;

E. Statement of actions that the applicant will take to obtain verifiable identification from all encampment residents and to use the identification to obtain sex offender and warrant checks from appropriate agencies;

F. Project statistics, including site area, building coverage, number and location of tents and temporary structures, expected and maximum number of residents, and duration of the encampment;

G. A legal description of the subject property, including parcel number;

H. Photographs of the site;

I. A list of other permits that are or may be required for development of the property (issued by the City or by other government agencies), insofar as they are known to the applicant;

J. A list of any requirement under this chapter for which the applicant is asking to modify, as allowed under UPMC 19.36.070(D).

(Ord. 609 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012).


19.36.070 Decision and appeal.

A. Applications for temporary tent encampments shall be processed as a Type I permit in accordance with Chapter 22.05 UPMC.

B. Decision. The Director shall decide whether to grant, grant with conditions or deny a temporary use permit. Before any temporary use permit may be granted, the applicant shall show that:

1. The proposed use will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity of the proposed encampment;

2. The proposed use shall meet the performance standards that are required in the zoning district the encampment will occupy and the requirements of this chapter;

3. The proposed use shall be in keeping with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan;

4. All measures have been taken to minimize the possible adverse impacts which the proposed encampment may have on the area in which it is located.

Notice of Decision: A notice of the decision stating whether the permit is granted or denied, along with information regarding the procedure for appeal of the decision, shall be mailed as required for the notice of decision in accordance with Chapter 22.05 UPMC. If issued, the permit for the temporary tent encampment shall be issued jointly to the sponsor and managing agency and each shall be responsible for compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit and applicable City codes.

C. Conditions. Because each temporary tent encampment has unique characteristics, including, but not limited to, size, duration, uses, number of occupants and composition, the Director shall have the authority to impose conditions on the approval of a temporary use permit to ensure that the proposal meets the criteria for approval listed above. Conditions, if imposed, must be intended to minimize nuisance-generating features in matters of noise, waste, air quality, unsightliness, traffic, physical hazards and other similar matters that the temporary tent encampment may have on the area in which it is located. In cases where the application for temporary use permit does not meet the provisions of this chapter (except when allowed under subsection (D) of this section) or adequate mitigation may not be feasible or possible, the Director shall deny the application.

D. Modification of Requirements. The Director may approve a temporary use permit for a tent encampment that relaxes one or more of the standards in this chapter only when, in addition to satisfying the decision criteria stated above, the applicant submits a description of the standard to be modified and demonstrates how the modification would result in a safe encampment with minimal negative impacts to the host community under the specific circumstances of the application. In considering whether the modification should be granted, the Director shall first consider the effects on the health and safety of encampment residents and the neighboring communities. Modifications shall not be granted if their adverse impact on encampment residents and/or neighboring communities will be greater than those without modification. The burden of proof shall be on applicant.

E. Appeal. The Director’s decision may be appealed to the Hearings Examiner in accordance with UPMC 22.05.120.

19.40.050    Burden of proof.

19.40.060    Decision.


19.40.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a process to site necessary public uses that may otherwise be difficult to site. This process involves the community and identifies and minimizes adverse impacts. Essential public facilities are defined in Chapter 19.10 UPMC, Definitions. Essential public facilities which meet the definition but are not listed in Chapter 19.25 UPMC shall also be reviewed according to the essential public facility review process.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.40.020 List of essential public facilities.

A use or facility may be added to the list of essential public facilities based on one of the following criteria:

A. The use meets the definition of an essential public facility; and

B. The use is identified on the state list of essential public facilities maintained by the State of Washington Office of Financial Management.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.40.030 Applicability.

A. Listed Essential Public Facilities. All listed essential public facilities shall be reviewed through the essential public facility review process.

B. Unlisted Facilities. The director shall make a determination that a facility be reviewed pursuant to this section based on the following criteria:

1. The facility is a type difficult to site because of one of the following:

a. The facility needs a type of site of which there are few sites;

b. The facility can locate only near another public facility;

c. The facility has or is generally perceived by the public to have significant adverse impacts that make it difficult to site;

d. The facility is of a type that has been difficult to site in the past;

e. It is likely that the facility will be difficult to site; or

f. There is a need for the facility and University Place is in the facility service area.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 423 § 62, 2004; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.40.040 Essential public facilities review process.

A. Agencies planning on siting essential public facilities shall submit an application to the department. The application shall be on a form provided by the city and shall be accompanied by the following documents and information as are determined to be necessary by the director.

B. Essential public facilities shall be reviewed as follows:

1. Essential public facilities shall require a conditional use permit.

2. If an essential public facility is not listed within the zoning district, then the use shall be limited to the Light Industrial – Business Park zone or Chambers Creek properties. Essential public facilities that are not expressly listed in a zoning district are subject to either:

a. Conditional use permit process; and

b. Comprehensive plan/rezone process.

3. In addition to a conditional use permit, all essential public facilities shall be subject to review in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

C. An applicant may have one or more alternative sites considered during the same process.

D. The director has the authority to require the consideration of sites outside of the city of University Place. Alternative sites shall cover the service area of the proposed essential public facility.

E. An amplified public involvement process shall be required. The purpose of the public involvement process is to involve affected persons of likely and foreseeable impacts if the involvement process has the potential to lead to more appropriate design/location or if that process could lead to development of incentives to address modifications to the facility which would make the siting of that facility more acceptable.

F. The applicant shall propose an acceptable public involvement process to be reviewed and approved by the director.

G. Public involvement activities shall be conducted and paid for by the applicant.

H. The public involvement process shall be initiated by the applicant as early as possible.

I. The director may require a multidisciplinary review process if the facility serves a regional, countywide, statewide, or national need.

J. An analysis of the facility’s impact on city finances shall be undertaken. Mitigation of adverse financial impacts shall be required.

K. The following criteria shall be used to make a determination on the application:

1. The federal, state, regional, or local agency (applicant) shall provide a justifiable need for the essential public facility and for its location within the city of University Place.

2. The impact of the facility on the surrounding uses and environment, the city and, if applicable, the region.

3. Whether the design of the facility or the operation of the facility can be conditioned, or the impacts otherwise mitigated, to make the facility compatible with the affected area and the environment.

4. Whether the factors that make the facility difficult to site can be modified to increase the range of available sites or to minimize impacts in affected areas and the environment.

5. Whether the proposed essential public facility is consistent with the city of University Place comprehensive plan.

6. If a variance is requested, the proposal shall also comply with the variance criteria.

7. Essential public facilities shall also comply with all other applicable state siting and permitting requirements.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 423 § 63, 2004; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.40.050 Burden of proof.

The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed use meets all criteria set forth in UPMC 19.40.040(K).

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003).


19.40.060 Decision.

The Director or Hearings Examiner may approve an application for an essential public facility, approve with conditions or require modification of the proposal to comply with specified requirements or local conditions. The Director may deny an application for an essential public facility if the placement of the use would be unreasonably incompatible with the surrounding area or incapable of meeting the criteria required for approval or with specific standards set forth in this code.

19.45.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish density and dimensional standards for development.

(Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 589 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.45.020 Tables.

Interpretation of Tables. The density and dimension tables located at the end of this chapter are arranged in a matrix format. Development standards are listed down the left side of both tables and the zones and overlay zones are listed across the top. The matrix cells contain the minimum dimensional requirements of the zone. The footnotes in the matrix identify specific requirements applicable either to a specific use or zone or overlay zone. A blank box indicates that the cell is not applicable.

(Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 589 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 409 § 7, 2004; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.45.030 Density standards.

A. All density provisions shall be calculated in dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The density calculation shall be based upon the net acreage, subtracting out land that, by City, State or Federal regulation, is unbuildable, including:

1. Critical areas including, but not limited to, wetlands, floodways, landslide hazard areas, and fish and wildlife habitat areas. On-site density transfer provided for in UPMC 17.35.050 shall be factored into the calculation;

2. Land below the ordinary high water mark; and

3. Land set aside by dedication or easement for public or private streets. Property within City-acquired easements per subsection (B) of this section, easements for shared driveways serving no more than two units or lots, or easements for alleys is not excluded from density calculations and is counted as buildable acreage.

Land that may be difficult or expensive to build upon, but where development is not prohibited, is included as buildable acreage. (See also UPMC 19.10.030, Definitions, “Density.”) When calculating density, no rounding is used.

B. Where the City has acquired an easement for street improvements adjoining an existing public street right-of-way, the area of the easement shall be used in density and minimum lot size calculations to determine the number of dwelling units allowed.

C. Base densities are established in UPMC 19.45.100 for each zoning district that allows residential use. Compliance with base density and maximum density standards is required for dwelling units in the MF-L, MF-H, MU-O, MU, MU-M, NC, CC, and TC districts. New lots created through a short plat or conventional subdivision in the R1 and R2 districts shall comply with minimum lot size requirements to achieve a density that is equivalent to the base density.

D. Densities may be increased above the specified base density to the maximum density specified in UPMC 19.45.100 for small lot developments that achieve reduced lot sizes in exchange for the provision of open space and greater amenities. For small lot developments that are not subject to minimum lot size standards, compliance with maximum density standards is required.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 662 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 646 § 2 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 566 § 2, 2010; Ord. 559 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 514 § 3, 2008; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.45.040 Setback standards.

A. A setback is the minimum required distance between any structure and a specified line such as a lot, public right-of-way, private road, easement or buffer line that is required to remain free of structures unless otherwise provided. A setback is typically measured from the property line, which may coincide with a public street right-of-way. Where a property line is located within a private street easement, the setback is measured from the edge of the easement. Where the City has acquired an easement for street improvements adjoining an existing public street right-of-way, the setback is measured from the public street right-of-way/property line. A minimum eight-foot setback measured from the edge of a driveway access easement is required. An eight-foot setback is required from portions of hammerhead turnaround easements used only for emergency vehicle access. A setback is measured to the leading edge of a structure or the foundation of a building. Once a determination has been made as to whether a particular yard constitutes a front, side or rear yard, and a structure has been placed on the lot in accordance with applicable setback requirements, the established yard determination shall be maintained. See Figure 1.


[IMAGE]


B. Pipestem Lots. The owner of a pipestem where the pipestem is either part of the lot or an easement to the lot may select one of the following setbacks:

1. Minimum 15 feet from all property lines for both principal and accessory structures.

2. A 25-foot setback from a line drawn parallel to the street, at the street end of the pipestem, with all other applicable side and rear yard setbacks for the zone. See Figure 2.


[IMAGE]


C. Where the City has acquired easements for right-of-way purposes, the City may reduce the minimum required setback from the edge of the right-of-way or easement.

D. Designation of Required Setbacks. All lots must contain at least one front yard setback except pipestem lots when the provision of subsection (B)(1) of this section is applied. A front yard setback shall be required abutting each street. Corner lots and through lots may have two or more front yards. All lots must contain one rear yard setback except for through and pipestem lots when the provision of subsection (B)(1) of this section is applied. All other setbacks will be considered side yard setbacks.

1. Corner Lots Exception. If a lot abuts the intersection of two or more streets, the front yard setback on one side of the lot may be reduced to 15 feet, provided the reduced yard does not abut an arterial street. Garages and carports shall be designed to ensure a minimum distance of 25 feet from the garage door to the front property line. See Figure 3a. If a lot abuts a curving street that has no distinct intersection to define two street frontages, the midpoint on the curved front property line shall define the two front yards. See Figure 3b.

Figure 3a: Corner Lot Yards and Setbacks
[IMAGE]


Figure 3b: Curving Street Corner Lot
[IMAGE]


 

E. Through Lots. In the case of a through lot, a front yard setback is required abutting each street right-of-way. However, no rear yard setback is required. See Figure 4.


[IMAGE]


F. Front Yard Setback Averaging. Averaging may be used to reduce a front yard setback requirement when a principal building has been legally established on an abutting lot(s) within the required yard. This provision shall not apply if the abutting lot(s) has received a reduced setback based upon a discretionary land use approval. This exception shall be calculated as follows: See Figure 5.

1. Averaging shall be calculated by adding the existing front yard setbacks of the abutting lots together and dividing that figure by two.

2. In the case of a corner lot or when an abutting lot is vacant, averaging shall be calculated by adding the front yard setback of the abutting developed lot with the minimum front yard setback of the zone in which the construction is proposed and dividing that figure by two. 


[IMAGE]


G. Slopes. If the topography of a lot is such that the minimum front yard setback line is eight feet or more above the street grade, and there is no reasonable way to construct a driveway up to the dwelling unit level, a garage/carport may be built into the bank and set at least five feet back from the right-of-way.

H. Detached Accessory Structures – Exceptions.

1. Detached accessory structures including, but not limited to, garages, carports, garden sheds, and other accessory buildings may be placed in the required side and/or rear yard setback or a front yard which abuts an alley or serves as a rear yard where no access is provided (except accessory RV storage gates) from the yard to the street subject to the following requirements. See Figure 6.

a. The total area of structures shall be no larger than 600 square feet in gross floor area;

b. Maintain five-foot minimum side and rear yard setbacks;

c. Have no portion of the structure, such as eaves, closer than three feet from any property line;

d. Be no greater than 18 feet in height at top of ridge and 10 feet at the top wall plate where the roof structure connects to the wall; and

e. Be no closer than five feet to the primary structure.

2. Large children’s play equipment such as swing sets, big toys, and swimming pools (above- and in-ground) shall be set back a minimum of five feet from a side and/or rear property boundary.

3. Children’s play equipment, excluding swimming pools, may be placed in the required front yard; provided, that a minimum 15-foot front yard setback is maintained.

4. Detached accessory structures located within a small lot or multifamily development shall comply with the “Design Standards and Guidelines for Small Lot and Multifamily Development” adopted pursuant to Chapter 19.53 UPMC.

5. Detached accessory structures, play equipment, and related improvements located within a shoreline vegetation conservation area shall comply with the requirements in UPMC 18.25.100(E) and 18.30.130(C).


[IMAGE]


6. Mechanical equipment, including air conditioning units, heat pumps, swamp coolers and other HVAC equipment, shall be set back at least five feet from any side or rear property line and shall not encroach into required front yard setbacks.

I. Bus Shelters. School district or transit authority bus shelters may be located within a front yard setback when located on private property if they do not exceed 50 square feet of floor area and one story in height; provided, all applicable site distance requirements are met.

J. Projection Exception.

1. Projections including, but not limited to, fireplace structures, bay or garden windows, building wall modulations and enclosed stair landings may project into any setback, provided such projections are:

a. Limited to two per required yard, separated from each other by at least 10 feet.

b. Not wider than 10 feet.

c. Not more than two feet into an interior side or rear yard setback.

d. Not more than two feet into the setback that extends landward from a shoreline vegetation conservation area buffer established per UPMC 18.25.100(C)(3), except for building wall modulations, which are not allowed to encroach into this setback.

e. Not more than three feet into a front yard setback.

2. Uncovered decks with floors that do not exceed 30 inches from average finished grade measured at the perimeter of the deck may project into any setback, provided such projections do not extend more than six feet into a front yard setback, three feet into a side yard setback, and 15 feet into a rear yard setback. In no case shall a deck encroach further into a yard than 50 percent of the setback. Decks located within a shoreline vegetation conservation area buffer shall comply with the standards specified in UPMC 18.25.100(E)(3).

3. Unenclosed covered porches with floors that do not exceed 30 inches from average finished grade measured at the perimeter of the porch may project six feet into a required front yard setback. Steps providing access to the porch may further encroach into the required setback as needed to meet code.

4. Patio covers and unenclosed covered decks or porches with floors that do not exceed 30 inches from average finished grade measured at the perimeter of the patio cover, deck or porch may project 10 feet into a required rear yard.

5. Wheelchair ramps may project into any required setback.

6. Eaves may extend 24 inches into a required setback.

7. Patios, paved walkways and driveways may extend to property lines.

8. Projection exceptions for small lot or multifamily development shall comply with the “Design Standards and Guidelines for Small Lot and Multifamily Development” adopted pursuant to Chapter 19.53 UPMC.

9. Projection exceptions for properties located within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction shall comply with the vegetation conservation area requirements in UPMC 18.25.100(E), when applicable.

K. Rear Yards Exception. In the case of triangular or otherwise irregularly shaped lots, a line 10 feet in length entirely within the lot, parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot line, may be considered the “rear lot line” at the owner’s discretion. See Figure 7.


[IMAGE]


L. Exemption for Personal Wireless Telecommunication Facilities. Setback exemptions for personal wireless telecommunication facilities are provided in Chapter 23.45 UPMC.

M. Variances to Exceptions Not Permitted. An exception is not allowed, except for eaves, when a variance has already been granted for the same purpose. For example, a side yard projection exception may not be used if a side yard variance has been granted to extend the same structural component into the required side yard setback.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 662 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 628 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 514 § 3, 2008; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.45.050 Height standards.

“Height of fence or wall” means the measured distance between the finished grade on the low side of the fence or wall to the top of the fence or wall.

“Maximum height of fence or wall” means the maximum allowed height of wall measured at any point along the wall.

“Retaining wall – cut” means a retaining wall that serves to protect an alteration or excavation of an existing slope of native soils material resulting in a new face or slope (see Diagrams 1 and 3).

“Retaining wall – fill” means a retaining wall built to support fill soils to achieve a new ground surface (see Diagrams 2 and 3).

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 628 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 571 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 559 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.45.080 Floor area ratio (FAR) standards.

A. The intent of FAR standards is to ensure the size of new homes in small lot and cottage developments and on existing substandard lots of record will be scaled proportionally to the size of the lots on which they are situated so that new infill development will be generally consistent in scale and proportion with previously constructed homes and neighborhoods in the City. FAR standards should be used in conjunction with other bulk requirements and design standards and guidelines to be effective in achieving this intent.

B. FAR is the ratio of the total floor area of buildings on a site to the size of the land at that location. FAR is the total building square footage divided by the total site area square footage, except as noted below.

C. Floor area for purposes of calculating FAR and maximum floor area does not include the following:

1. Attic floor area with less than five feet of ceiling height, as measured between the finished floor and the supporting members for the roof, and attics with structural roof trusses and usable attic space that is completely contained within the roof area (excluding dormers).

2. Basement floor area with a ceiling height less than four feet above the average finished grade, as defined in UPMC 19.10.030. Ceiling height will be measured to the top of the structural members of the floor above.

3. The first 600 square feet of detached accessory building floor area on a lot.

4. Uncovered and covered decks, porches, and walkways.

D. Floor area with a ceiling height greater than 16 feet shall be calculated at twice the actual floor area toward allowable FAR.

E. FAR is calculated using a site’s buildable area, including private street area, and excluding area located waterward of the ordinary high water mark and critical areas and their required associated buffers.

F. FAR shall not exceed the standards established in UPMC 19.45.100.

G. FAR standards shall not apply to substandard lots of record located within the Day Island South Spit Overlay and Sunset Beach Overlay.

(Ord. 628 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.45.090 Minimum lot size standards.

A. Minimum lot sizes are established in UPMC 19.45.100 for the R1 and R2 districts. These standards apply to new lots created through the short plat or subdivision process. Minimum lot size varies depending on the type of residential use and the zone in which a property is located.

When determining the number of lots that would be permitted within a short plat or conventional preliminary plat while meeting the applicable minimum lot size standard, the calculation shall be based upon the net acreage as defined in UPMC 19.45.030. For example, if a one acre subdivision (43,560 square feet) in the R1 district dedicates 17+/- percent of gross acreage to street right-of-way, approximately 36,000 square feet of lot area (net acreage) would remain for development. This net acreage could be subdivided into four 9,000-square-foot lots that meet the R1 minimum lot size standard. This would equate to the R1 base density of four units per gross acre. For a one acre subdivision in the R2 zone, the same 36,000 square feet of lot area (net acreage) could be subdivided into six 6,000-square-foot lots that meet the R2 minimum lot size standard. This would equate to the R2 base density of six units per gross acre.

B. For small lot developments that provide additional open space and greater amenities in exchange for design flexibility in the R1 and R2 districts, minimum lot size standards do not apply. Instead, compliance with density standards per UPMC 19.45.030 and 19.45.100 is required.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 4 (Exh. A), 2009).

19.50.010 Purpose.

The following design standards are intended to promote integrated development and pedestrian-oriented design and to improve the character and quality of development in the Commercial, Mixed Use, and Mixed Use – Office zones.

A. Design standards help guide architects, developers and property owners to know what is expected of their development projects, and what could make their designs responsive to the plans and policies adopted by the City, as outlined in the City’s Vision and Comprehensive Plan and other City documents.

B. Examples or illustrations of how certain design standards can be achieved are included. The graphic examples are just that – examples. They are not the only acceptable solutions. Applicants and project designers may consider designs, styles and techniques which are not pictured in the examples but fulfill the intent of the design standards.

C. The design standards also provide ways to reduce negative impacts of development on abutting and adjacent properties.

D. The standards help establish a character for the commercial and mixed use areas which includes varied uses and is pedestrian-friendly. Impacts of the automobile are reduced, while easy access and movement through the area are maintained. The standards will implement the intent of the City of University Place Comprehensive Plan.

Prior to making such a decision, the Director shall seek a recommendation from the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall act as an advisory ad hoc design review committee. The Planning Commission may take public comment and shall make an advisory recommendation to the Director based upon the proposal’s consistency with the findings that follow:

a. That the departure from the design standards is consistent with both the Comprehensive Plan and with the intent statements of the design standards.

b. That departure from the strict application of the design standards will not have a significant negative impact on the public, or surrounding properties, or on the character of the zone.

c. That the proposal creates an equal or better environment, results in an equal or better use of land and an equal or better design than that which could be produced through the strict application of the design standards.

d. That the departures from the design standards are compensated by the provision of additional design features and amenities in the development plan that would not normally be required. The additional design features and amenities must be of equal or greater design benefit and function.

Based on a recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Director may approve all or part of an applicant’s request for a departure from the strict application of the design standards, approve with additional requirements above those specified in this code, or require modification of the proposal to comply with specified requirements or local conditions.

The Director shall deny a request for modification from the design standards if the proposal does not meet or cannot be conditioned to meet the required findings in this section.

19.52.160 Crime prevention through environmental design.

Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) is situational crime prevention based on changing and managing the physical environment to produce behavioral effects that will reduce the incidence and fear of crime, thereby improving the quality of life and enhancing profitability for business.

A. Guidelines.

1. Create territories that clearly delineate private space from semi-public and public spaces, and develop a sense of ownership. Ownership creates an environment where appearances of strangers and intruders stand out and are more easily identified.

2. Design spaces to allow for continued use and intended purposes. 

3. Use pavement treatments, landscaping, art, signage, screening and fences to define and outline ownership of space.

4. Promote natural surveillance by creating environments where there is plenty of opportunity for people engaged in their normal behavior to observe the space around them. Areas can be designed so they are more easily observed through:

a. Design and placement of physical features to maximize visibility, including building orientation, windows, entrances and exits, parking lots, refuse containers, walkways, landscape trees and shrubs, use of wrought iron fences or walls, signage and other physical obstructions.

b. Placement of persons or activities to maximize surveillance possibilities.

5. Maintain lighting that provides for nighttime illumination of parking lots, walkways, entrances, exits and related areas to promote a safe environment.

6. Provide access control, to limit access and increase natural surveillance, especially into areas where people are not easily observed. When present, intruders are more readily recognized through:

a. The use of sidewalks, pavement, gates, lighting and landscaping to clearly guide the public to and from entrances and exits.

b. The use of gates, fences, walls, landscaping and lighting to prevent or discourage public access to or from dark or unmonitored areas.

c. Maintain landscaping, lighting treatment and other features to reinforce territories, natural surveillance and access control.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A (CC8), 2017).


19.52.170 Setbacks.

Building to the back of the sidewalk, courtyard or plaza facilitates easy pedestrian access. Varying building setback and projection provides horizontal articulation and architectural interest.

A. Standards.

Comprehensive Plan policies encourage a diversity of housing types that respond to market demand for a greater choice of housing options than is currently available in the community. An objective is to accommodate housing at moderately higher densities in specific areas of the City than has traditionally been constructed in single-family neighborhoods. The design standards and guidelines direct two such types of housing, small lot and multifamily development, to be built to high standards and achieve pedestrian-oriented designs that encourage interaction among neighbors. They also provide strategies to efficiently and effectively manage and protect the City’s existing natural systems, including water quality, habitat and biological resources, from the harmful effects of land development and stormwater runoff. The guidelines and standards are intended to ensure that low impact development components are integrated into the designs of future small lot and multifamily development. The goal is for this new housing to become a valued addition to the City’s existing residential neighborhoods and enhance the community’s positive identity.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 1)).


19.53.060 Purpose and objectives.

The primary purpose of this document is to provide design professionals, property owners, residents, staff, and decision-makers with a clear and common understanding of the City’s expectations for the planning, design and review of small lot and multifamily development proposals in University Place.

The design standards and guidelines provide a framework to evaluate new development projects against the City’s objective to ensure that these projects are well designed, integrated compatibly into the neighborhood context, and contribute to an enhanced community aesthetic.

These guidelines are intended to do the following:

A. Provide a basis for making fair and consistent decisions in design review;

B. Ensure compatibility of new homes within existing neighborhoods;

C. Provide incentives for investment;

D. Enhance property values; and

E. Serve as a design tool and reference document for residents, designers, property owners, staff and decision-makers. 

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 1(A)).


19.53.070 Applicability and use types.

A. The design standards and guidelines apply to “small lot” single-family and “multifamily” developments. “Small lots” typically are those less than 6,000 square feet, and small lot developments encourage diversity in the size of dwelling units by promoting and preserving smaller homes on smaller lots. “Multifamily” buildings are designed for occupancy by three or more families in three or more dwelling units, and multifamily developments can be designed to accommodate rental or owner-occupied units. The standards and guidelines apply to new small lot developments in R1 Residential and R2 Residential zones and new multifamily developments in Multifamily Low (MF-L) and Multifamily High (MF-H) zones. They will also apply to infill single-family dwellings on existing substandard lots of record and qualifying modifications to existing small lot and multifamily development. Provisions are organized by and based on development type, rather than zoning designation. 

B. For a complete listing of qualifying and exempt residential projects, see UPMC 19.53.030.

C. Qualifying residential projects will be subject to administrative design review in accordance with UPMC 19.85.050 to ensure conformance with the design standards and guidelines. In some cases, design provisions are mandated and in other cases there is more flexibility in how a project can meet a particular design objective. Generally, the following rules apply to language used in Articles IV and V of this chapter:

1. “Shall” or “must” indicates a design standard and means that conformance is mandatory.

2. “Should” or “encouraged” means the guideline is intended to be a recommendation about how to implement the goals of the design standards and guidelines.

D. The design standards and guidelines shall be used in conjunction with other documents adopted by the City that contain goals, development parameters, and more specific regulations relative to a particular type of development. Projects shall comply with applicable provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, zoning code and other municipal code requirements. When provisions included in the design standards and guidelines conflict with other requirements of this title, these standards and guidelines shall apply unless otherwise provided. 

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 1(B))).


19.53.080 Design review process.

One of the paramount goals of the City’s Comprehensive Plan is to retain or create the qualities that comprise livable, memorable and diverse community life. Zoning and other numerical standards and formulas are inadequate tools, by themselves, for building a livable community in that they cannot ensure quality of physical design. Design review is intended to be a complementary means of retaining, enhancing, or creating a sense of community through its physical structures. Administrative design review is a discretionary process established to determine the compliance of a development proposal with applicable design standards and guidelines. The design review process ensures that there is a harmonious balance between the natural and built environments in a community. It is also used to ensure quality development in accordance with the City’s design objectives and to ensure that the appearance of development will be compatible and harmonious with the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties.

Applicants should review this document’s stated purpose and objectives, design goals and concepts section, and design standards and guidelines section, to understand the rationale and spirit of the guidelines. Applicants should contact the City early in the project planning and design process to determine application and processing requirements and discuss key issues particular to a specific site. 

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 1(C))).

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 1(D))).


19.53.100 Definitions.

Articulation: The manner in which portions of a building form are expressed (materials, color, texture, pattern, modulation, etc.).

Authentic architectural style: Architecture that encompasses many styles within an architectural theme, a holistic approach. Possessing appropriate architectural characteristics, massing, and detail consistent with a specific architectural style.

Canopy: A roofed structure constructed of fabric or other material placed to extend outward from a building providing a protective shield for doors, windows, and other openings, supported by the building and supports extended to the ground directly under the canopy or cantilevered from the building.

Compatible: Capable of existing together without conflict or detrimental effects.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 5(A))).

Article III. Design Goals and Concepts


19.53.110 Purpose.

This article provides overall design goals and design concepts for the achievement of good urban design Citywide. Specific goals for each development type are provided in Article IV, followed by standards and guidelines to achieve the design goals. The standards are intended to mandate necessary design components in small lot and multifamily projects that will help to create or preserve good urban fabric. The guidelines are intended to encourage high-quality building and site design while allowing flexibility for designers on a site-specific basis. 

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 2)).


19.53.120 Overall design goals.

The design standards and guidelines have been created to help protect and improve the existing character of University Place’s established residential neighborhoods. Overall design goals for small lot and multifamily developments are listed below.

A. Preserve and enhance the existing character of established residential neighborhoods by encouraging development that creates a strong community image and a harmonious appearance;

B. Promote new construction that respects and responds to the character of the surrounding built and natural environments and is compatible with existing and evolving residential neighborhoods’ site development patterns, mass and scale, and streetscape appearance;

C. Encourage new small lot and multifamily developments that balance diversity of style with respect for the surrounding context;

D. Decrease the visual prominence of the automobile and related facilities, such as streets, driveways and parking areas, in residential neighborhoods;

E. Encourage greater variety in housing types, housing choices, site planning and density mixes in order to provide more diversity and visual interest in the City’s residential development, while preserving the City’s predominantly single-family residential character;

F. Foster consideration of neighbors’ concerns regarding privacy, scale, massing and streetscape;

G. Provide design parameters for residential structures so that the projects are harmoniously integrated as they relate to the architecture in the vicinity in terms of colors and materials, scale and building design. Designs should be sensitive to and compatible with historic and architecturally significant buildings in the vicinity, and should enhance important community gateways and view corridors;

H. Encourage development that contributes to the character of University Place by establishing linkages to community focal points, such as open space, parks, schools and civic buildings;

I. Strengthen the pedestrian realm by encouraging landscaping and building elements, such as enhanced paving materials, accent lighting, streetscape furniture and adequate sidewalk space, which will contribute to pedestrian environments that are attractive and physically safe; 

J. Maximize stormwater infiltration within developments and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off site through the use of LID techniques; and

K. Encourage new development that is urban, environmentally sustainable and energy efficient in scale, treatment and character.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 2(A))).


19.53.130 Neighborhood design concepts.

University Place is an established community with existing neighborhoods that have a rich and diverse history. It is a primary objective of these guidelines to ensure that new small lot and multifamily developments are compatible with the adjacent homes and surrounding neighborhood. Information in this section is intended to explain the concept of neighborhood design.

A. What Is a Neighborhood? Neighborhoods are defined as a place with a character and a boundary. They are the strategic building blocks of a community. A neighborhood can be considered at two levels:

1. The immediate context or how the house or other residential structure relates to the adjacent houses and buildings (see Figure 19.53.130-1); and

2. The neighborhood context or how the house or other residential structure relates to the visual character and scale of other houses and buildings in the general vicinity (see Figure 19.53.130-2).
[IMAGE]

Immediate Context

Figure 19.53.130-2

Neighborhood Context

B. What Are the Limits of a Neighborhood? For the purposes of these guidelines, neighborhood is defined as the block in which the subject property is located and the area of influence around the residence. For areas of the community that do not have an established block pattern, the neighborhood may be considered an area framed by arterial or collector streets, topographic or other natural features, or typified by one or more common characteristics. The nature of a neighborhood is often determined by the patterns shared between the houses and other structures that formed that neighborhood. These patterns or characteristics include similarities in mass, scale, complexity of form, topography, relationship to the street and to each other (see Figure 19.53.130-3).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.130-3

Immediate neighborhood of this house

C. How Does a House or Other Residential Structure Contribute to the Neighborhood Character? The scale and mass, window and door patterns, roof and architectural style of a building all make up the character of the building. Following are some of the common architectural elements that contribute to the character of an individual house and other residential structures and the neighborhood:

1. General height and mass of buildings in the neighborhood;

2. General location of buildings on the street and the way those buildings meet the street – porches, walkways, landscaping;

3. Setback, parking and garage patterns;

4. Architectural style of a house or houses in a neighborhood;

5. Arrangement of major building forms;

6. Location of entries;

7. Roof forms;

8. Number of stories;

9. Materials;

10. Window type;

11. Landscaping;

12. Historic buildings or features;

13. Topography.

The City recognizes and values the unique characteristics of its existing neighborhoods. This section is not intended to dictate a single solution to every type of neighborhood development application. Rather, these guidelines introduce good neighborhood design concepts and general provisions that can be applied to varying degrees within the distinct types of neighborhoods throughout the City.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 2(B))).


19.53.140 Low impact development concepts.

Low impact development (LID) is a more sustainable land development approach (compared with conventional designs) that begins with a site planning process that identifies critical natural resource areas for preservation. LID mimics a site’s predevelopment hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff close to its source.

Development patterns based on conventional zoning codes often result in “sprawl” with its associated large impervious areas, loss of natural resources and habitat, increase in nonpoint source pollution, and alteration of hydrologic systems. Conventional developments often start with clearing and leveling of the entire parcel. Construction of wide, paved roads and over-designed large parking lots typically follows. These sprawling impervious areas eliminate vegetation and prevent water from infiltrating into the ground (see Figures 19.53.140-1 and 19.53.140-2). The result is the conveying of polluted runoff to water bodies. In order to deal with stormwater that runs off these sites, structural controls such as catch basins, pipes, and detention ponds are used. Instead of “greenscapes,” conventional landscaping of these developments brings additional concerns including the introduction of non-native plants, use of herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers, and excessive water consumption.

The LID approach provides opportunities to build homes while conserving natural areas and drainage patterns. LID is accomplished as a two-step process; first – thoughtful site planning and, second – incorporation of “natural” stormwater best management practices (BMPs).

Thoughtful site planning begins with the identification of critical site features such as wetlands, habitat areas, or drinking water protection areas that should be set aside as protected open space. Natural features, such as vegetated buffers and view sheds, will also play an integral role in any LID planning exercise. After the critical open space areas are identified and set aside, sustainable development areas are then identified as “building envelopes.”


[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.140-2

A clustered development with smaller setbacks and preserved natural areas (left) contrasts with a conventional subdivision where all the trees have been removed.

Within the delineated building envelopes, a broad range of design techniques or BMPs, such as shared driveways, permeable pavers, and bioretention, are used to reduce the level of impervious cover and improve the quantity and quality of stormwater drainage. Other LID design techniques include green roofs, roof rainwater collection systems, rain gardens, grassed swales, stormwater infiltration systems, and alternative landscaping. Through these techniques, natural drainage pathways are conserved, open space is preserved, and the overall impact from development is significantly reduced.

Often LID techniques provide benefits beyond those related to water and drainage. For example, green roofs also muffle noise by reducing reflective sound, mitigate “urban heat island” effects by creating microclimates that cool and humidify air in their immediate area, absorb dust and smog as well as nitrates and other aerosol contaminants from air and rainfall, and generally provide natural habitat for wildlife including birds, butterflies, and insects.

LID techniques implement development practices that are sustainable and can result in: multifunctionality, lower construction costs, environmental and social benefits, reduced off-site costs, more functional use of open space land, better integration of the built environment with the natural environment, reduced energy costs and increased property values.

Design guidelines in Articles IV and V related to LID are identified with a “” symbol. 

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 2(C))).


19.53.150 Design elements.

Article IV. The design standards and guidelines in Article IV are organized into two housing type categories – small lot development and multifamily development, and three design elements for each housing type. This section explains the importance of each element in building stronger neighborhoods.

A. Site Planning and Design. Site planning and design standards and guidelines are intended to improve site planning to enhance the image of the City, reflect unique site characteristics, and provide strong neighborhood environments; promote a superior appearance for both small lot single-family and multifamily developments; minimize modifications to topography, preserving existing vegetation whenever possible; minimize the creation of impervious surfaces; create appropriate provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation; develop site plans that preserve and integrate healthy and mature existing trees into the overall development scheme to establish optimum environmental conditions by providing shade, air purification, management of stormwater runoff, etc.; protect natural site features, open space, and historic structures to the maximum extent possible in order to maintain the local character, and use and incorporate such features and areas as community amenities; and provide useable open space, or maintain significant natural areas, for the use and enjoyment by residents of the new developments.

The site planning and design section features the following subcategories:

1. Building siting and orientation;

2. Grading and stormwater management;

3. Lot standards;

4. Front yards/entrances;

5. Parking and garage placement and design;

6. Individual outdoor spaces;

7. Common open spaces;

8. Utility areas and accessory structures.

B. Building Design. Building design guidelines are intended to create and add to the visual interest of University Place’s streets; ensure quality and consistency in building architectural character and style; ensure compatibility with adjacent development, as applicable; avoid featureless building massing; provide building design details to reduce the visual scale of large multifamily buildings; achieve unity of design through the use of similar materials and colors; ensure use of building materials that are durable and attractive; encourage the provision of private open spaces for residents’ enjoyment; and ensure accessory structures are compatible in design with the primary buildings they serve.

Additions to existing structures should be designed to be compatible with the architectural style of the structure and surrounding neighborhood. Small lot residential buildings should be designed to avoid large, featureless facades. Multifamily developments should be designed to be compatible with surrounding single-family neighborhoods. 

The building design section features the following subcategories:

1. Mass, scale and form;

2. Architectural style;

3. Facades and entries;

4. Roofs;

5. Materials and colors;

6. Windows and doors, porches and balconies;

7. Other design elements.

C. Lighting. Lighting guidelines are intended to eliminate adverse impacts of light spillover; provide attractive lighting fixtures and layout patterns that contribute to a unified exterior lighting design; encourage energy efficiency, and provide exterior lighting that promotes safe vehicular and pedestrian access to and within a development, while minimizing impacts on adjacent properties and the nighttime sky.

Article V. The design standards and guidelines in Article V apply to landscape design that is common to small lot and multifamily projects. Landscaping guidelines encourage designers to consider creative ways to screen and buffer unsightly uses; separate incompatible uses; enhance a project’s open space and buildings, reinforce streetscape character and respond to site and surrounding context.

The landscaping article features the following elements:

1. General landscape design;

2. Front yard landscape design;

3. Landscaping and planting requirements;

4. Parking area landscaping.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 2(D))).

Article IV. Small Lot and Multifamily Design Standards


19.53.160 Small lot and multifamily developments – Purpose and organization.

Residential design standards and guidelines within this article apply to two types of residential development: (1) small lot developments, and (2) multifamily developments. The standards and corresponding design guidelines are organized by design elements described in UPMC 19.53.150.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 3)).

Article IV-A. Small Lot Developments


19.53.170 Purpose and organization.

A. Small Lot Developments. Small lot developments are single-family residential projects on “small lots.” Small lot single-family development encourages diversity in the size of dwelling units by promoting and preserving smaller homes on smaller lots (see Figure 19.53.170-1). Small lot developments may include a mix of attached and detached units provided the number of attached units does not exceed one-third of the total units within a project.


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.170-1

Top: Poulsbo Place; Middle and Bottom: Seabrook

B. Three design elements for small lot development are listed below. Each element includes specific approval standard(s) and corresponding design guidelines to ensure that small lot projects meet the City’s design expectations. 

The standards and guidelines emphasize pedestrian-oriented streetscapes that are not dominated by garages, which includes improving the pedestrian qualities of neighborhood streets by addressing issues related to street-level uses: blank walls near sidewalks, sidewalks and street landscaping.

1. Design Element 1: Site Planning and Design.

2. Design Element 2: Building Design.

3. Design Element 3: Lighting. 

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 3)).


19.53.180 Site planning and design.

A. SL1: Building Siting and Orientation.

Design Objective: To define the focus of activity that occurs at the front door or along the street and establishes a sense of community for a neighborhood by providing opportunities for people to gather. Building siting and orientation should encourage streetscapes that facilitate interaction among residents.

SL1.1. Approval Standards.

SL1.1.1. Site design elements shall display a clear and unified organization of building, landscaping and circulation elements that support the functions of the site. Site plans shall effectively demonstrate how the elements of the site relate to the street front and provide for compatibility with adjacent uses.

SL1.1.2. Placement of buildings shall consider the existing context of the surrounding area. Small lot developments shall respect privacy and solar access through appropriate siting of structures. Building setbacks around the perimeter of the site shall be consistent with the development standards of the underlying zoning district. Variation is permitted where the perimeter of the site abuts dedicated open space, stormwater facilities or railroad rights-of-way.

SL1.1.3. A pair of attached units shall be separated from another pair of attached units on the same block face by one or more detached units. Attached units on a street corner may be placed next to attached units on an adjacent street corner on the same block face if separated by an alley.

SL1.2. Design Guidelines.

SL1.2.1.  Project elements (lots, buildings, access drives, parking, walkways, and service areas) should be located to protect, enhance, or minimize impacts to natural site features. For example, buildings should be designed to fit the natural slope, rather than forcing the slope to fit the building design. Terraced parking lots and multi-tiered buildings are other examples of effective design solutions that minimize impacts to a site’s natural features. 

SL1.2.2. New developments should be integrated with the existing neighborhoods adjacent to them. Designs should avoid the separation caused by high, solid fencing and walls, or blank walls of buildings (see Figures 19.53.180-1 and 19.53.180-2). Traffic calming measures such as traffic circles, curb extensions and bulb-outs should be used where streets connect to existing neighborhoods.

Undesirable Design: Houses separated from the street by high solid walls

SL1.2.3. Buildings should be oriented to the street to create an inviting streetscape. Interesting streetscapes promote pedestrian activity in and around the site. Buildings at or near the street can help create interaction between adjacent uses. 

SL1.2.4. Small lot residential projects should provide one living/family/community living room at the front of the home facing onto the street (see Figure 19.53.180-3);
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-3

Single-family homes in Seabrook oriented to the street and sidewalk

SL1.2.5. Residential development adjacent to designated open space areas should maintain visual access to the open space from residential units, common buildings, and/or streets (buildings should not back up to open space areas creating areas hidden from public view). Projects should also provide for future connections to currently undeveloped properties via public or private streets, internal drives and biking and walking trails (see Figure 19.53.180-4). 


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-4

Single-family homes in Seabrook oriented to internal pedestrian trail

SL1.2.6. Buildings may be oriented to open space areas, provided that street frontages are developed consistent with guideline SL1.2.3 (see Figure 19.53.180-5).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-5

Single-family homes in Seabrook oriented to linear park stormwater feature

SL1.2.7. Perimeter residences that are part of new developments should be oriented to existing streets, minimizing the extent of sound walls or rear yard walls, except where necessary due to acoustical requirements (see Figures 19.53.180-6 and 19.53.180-7).

Desirable: 

Walls should have a rhythm rather than a single monotonous design along the entire length. Landscaping and periodic entries or gateways soften appearances of walls, minimize driving and walking distances and integrate bike paths along the major roads.

 

SL1.2.8. Increase privacy on adjoining properties by employing the following techniques:

a. Locating/reorienting direction of windows or decks to minimize views directly into adjoining structures and outdoor gathering places (see Figure 19.53.180-8). 
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-8

Techniques to reduce privacy impacts and increase solar access

b. Use structural features (e.g., raised planter boxes on parapet walls, nontransparent glazing) to restrict view angles to long rather than short distance view (see Figure 19.53.180-9). 
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-9

Control view into adjacent properties through use of structural features

c. Use smaller upper floor windows or use selective glazing at privacy sensitive locations.

d. Use landscaping to reduce potential privacy impacts.

SL1.2.9. Pursuant to the zoning code, minimum-required building separations should not be reduced. If possible, increase setbacks for living areas that require more privacy. Where necessary to achieve greater privacy, re-orient the directions of windows or decks or adjust window size or sill height (e.g., use transom windows, skylights or other alternative glazing).

B. SL2: Grading and Stormwater Management.

Design Objective: To minimize modifications to topography, preserve existing vegetation whenever possible, minimize the creation of impervious surfaces, and maximize stormwater infiltration within the development site and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off-site through the use of LID techniques. 

SL2.1. Approval Standards.

SL2.1.1.  Structures, roadways and other site improvements (drainageways and storage areas) shall be designed to blend with the natural topography to the extent practicable, with a minimum of site disturbance and grade changes. 

SL2.1.2.  LID techniques shall be used to the extent practicable, as determined by a development site’s soil characteristics, to maximize stormwater infiltration within the site and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off site.

SL2.1.3. Stormwater facilities that are required to supplement LID facilities may include either stormwater ponds or underground vaults. Stormwater ponds shall be designed as a landscape amenity and planted with grass or native plants (see Figure 19.53.180-10). Stormwater ponds shall not be fenced, and shall not exceed a four horizontal to one vertical slope. Stormwater ponds may be used to meet open space requirements if designed utilizing the KCSWDM (see Figure 19.53.180-11). Stormwater ponds shall be designed in accordance with the King County Integrated Pond Manual. Maintenance of stormwater pond landscaping and open space amenities, beyond basic annual weed removal performed by the City, shall be the responsibility of a homeowner association (HOA) or other private entity.

Figure 19.53.180-11

Usable detention pond in public open space

SL2.1.4. To encourage front yard landscaping and minimize the visual impact of driveways and other hardscape, a maximum of 50 percent of the front yard between the facade of the home and front property line shall be paved or covered with impervious surface. 

SL2.1.5. Filling and grading shall be done in accordance with Chapter 13.25 UPMC and the King County Surface Water Design Manual (KCSWDM) to control stormwater runoff impacts to adjacent properties.

SL2.2. Design Guidelines.

SL2.2.1.  Small lot developments should integrate existing natural features, required open space, and existing historic structures or cultural resources located on site into the overall design and layout of the development. Existing natural features, as well as the required common open space, should be used to create community amenities and provide physical separations and buffers from adjacent development, where needed. The site plan should reflect natural hydrology and minimize impervious surfaces. 

a.  Preserve or design into the infrastructure naturally vegetated areas that are in close proximity to parking areas, buildings, and other impervious expanses in order to slow runoff, filter out pollutants, and facilitate infiltration.

b.  Direct runoff into or across vegetated areas to help filter runoff and encourage groundwater recharge.

c.  Use native plants (or adaptable species) to establish an adaptable and low maintenance landscape that requires less irrigation and is appropriate for the climatic conditions.

d.  Use devices such as bioretention cells, vegetated swales, infiltration trenches, and dry wells to increase storage volume and facilitate infiltration. 

e.  Plant bioswales with native grass to further improve water quality. Bioswales are encouraged throughout the development to treat runoff, improve water quality, and minimize or eliminate the size of detention ponds (see Figure 19.53.180-12).

f.  Disconnect impervious areas from the storm drain network and maintain natural drainage divides to keep flow paths dispersed. Maximize infiltration using: biofilters, green strips, swales and permeable materials in lieu of hardscapes.

SL2.2.2.  Surface water and pollutant runoff should be reduced by maximizing the use of pervious surfaces and vegetative groundcover.

a.  Use of permeable paving, pavers, turf stone, brick, and decomposed granite is encouraged.

b.  Use of natural topographic features or built swales for filtration of site drainage is encouraged.

c.  Porous concrete, porous paving stones, reinforced turf, crushed gravel with soil stabilizers, and paving blocks with planted joints are examples of acceptable materials that can be used for driveways, pathways, sidewalks, and patios.

SL2.2.3.  Development impacts should be reduced by minimizing a site’s impervious surface footprint. This can be achieved by encouraging new development where houses have smaller footprints and are clustered closer together, share driveways with neighboring homes and much of the native vegetation has been preserved.

SL2.2.4.  Existing trees and vegetation should be preserved whenever possible to act as buffers between adjoining developments and as community amenities within the development per Chapter 19.65 UPMC. Buildings, parking areas, and other structures should be set back from such features a sufficient distance to ensure their continued quality and natural functions (see Figure 19.53.180-12).

SL2.2.5. The “effective” impervious surface for the entire site should be minimized to the extent practicable while achieving urban densities consistent with the goals of accommodating small lot development and expanding housing choice in the community. 

C. SL3: Lot Standards. 

Design Objective: To strengthen the mutual relationship between housing units, roads, open space and pedestrian amenities for creating small lot developments that protect the privacy of individuals while creating pedestrian-oriented environments.

SL3.1. Approval Standards.

SL3.1.1. Building placement shall be configured to support the neighborhood’s existing site patterns, including building location, setbacks and yard areas, where existing patterns are clearly established and consistent. 

SL3.1.2. Standards for Lot Size and Width.

a. Lot Size. There is no minimum lot size. Lot size shall be determined through the administrative design review process.

b. Lot Width. Minimum 40-foot-wide lots for homes with front-loaded and side-loaded garages. No minimum width for lots with alley-loaded and other garage designs.

SL3.1.3. Setbacks shall ensure separation of homes and private spaces while allowing moderate density. Small-lot homes shall complement existing setback patterns in terms of distance to the street and spacing between homes while considering the smaller lot sizes and need for more private usable open space.

SL3.1.4. If used, reciprocal side and/or rear yard use easements shall be delineated on the site plan.

SL3.1.5. If a side yard use easement is used, the wall facing the side yard shall be constructed as a “privacy wall.” Privacy walls shall not have doors entering into the yard space of the adjacent home, nor have windows that are within five feet of ground level. 

SL3.2. Design Guidelines.

SL3.2.1. Building Setbacks.

a. Front on Neighborhood Street: 10 feet to primary building, six feet to porch, eight feet to stoop. There shall be at least a 20-foot setback from the face of a garage to the back of the sidewalk. A variety of setbacks is strongly encouraged, with single-story facades having smaller setbacks and two-story facades having greater setbacks (see Figure 19.53.180-13).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-13

Variations in front and side yard setbacks break up long linear patterns

b. Front on Access Lane: five feet to building, zero feet to porch or stoop. Stairs and roof overhangs associated with a porch or stoop shall not encroach into the public right-of-way. There shall be at least a 20-foot setback from the face of the garage to the back of a curb, except where a sidewalk/pathway is constructed, the setback shall be at least 20 feet from the sidewalk/pathway.

c. Interior Side: five feet for detached units; eight feet for attached units. Architectural projections such as fireplace structures, bay windows or garden windows may project into a five-foot required side yard only if the building is protected with an automatic fire sprinkler system.

e. Rear: four feet to adjacent common open space, otherwise 10 feet.

f. Alleyway: two feet from alleyway tract or easement (see Figure 19.53.180-14).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-14

Alleyway lot

g. Front on a Pedestrian Easement or Common Open Space: four feet to building or one foot to porch or stoop.

h. Side on a Pedestrian Easement or Common Open Space: four feet.

i. Decks: Decks are considered part of the building and shall not intrude into required setbacks. 

j. Perimeter: Same as the development standards of the underlying zoning district. A reduction may be permitted where the perimeter of the site abuts dedicated open space, stormwater facilities or railroad rights-of-way.

k. Homes that front on a common open space shall have all portions of the first floor within 150 feet of emergency vehicle access.

SL3.2.2. To facilitate development of small-lot single-family homes, rear alleys are the preferred alternative for accessing garages, off-street parking, utilities and trash facilities. Alleys shall be provided to serve all lots except where topography, site dimensions or other constraints preclude their use.

SL3.2.3. Use Easements.

a. Reciprocal side and/or rear yard use easements may be used to maximize the use of small yard areas (see Figures 19.53.180-15 and 19.53.180-16 for examples of side and rear yard use easements).

b. The design of use easements should not negatively affect the building foundations.

c. Given the intimate relationship between adjacent houses, the layout of each home on its lot should be designed to maximize this outdoor space.

E. SL5: Parking and Garage Placement and Design.

Design Objective: To create residential development where a variety of garage placements ensure that the garages and parking areas are subordinate to the main home/living area and do not dominate the views of residential development from public streets and sidewalks.

SL5.1. Approval Standards.

SL5.1.1. The driveway and the garage shall be secondary to the livable portions of the house, landscaping and pedestrian entry as seen from the street (see Figure 19.53.180-18).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-18:

Undesirable: Homes with garage and driveway dominated design

SL5.1.2. All garages shall be located in an area to minimize the presence of the automobile.

SL5.1.3. On-site garages shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from the front building facade with a minimum 20-foot driveway length from the face of the garage to the back of the sidewalk or access lane. Garages accessed by an alleyway are not required to provide a 20-foot driveway.

SL5.1.4. Shared detached garages shall not be located further than 160 feet from any of the housing units to which it is assigned. Shared detached garages shall not exceed 44 feet in width and shall maintain at least an eight-foot separation from any dwellings.

SL5.1.5. Private detached garages shall maintain a minimum five-foot separation from any dwellings.

SL5.1.6. A tandem driveway space is allowed on a lot and shall extend a minimum of 20 feet from back of sidewalk or 20 feet from back of access lane.

SL5.1.7. The width of the driveway (excluding curb returns) shall not exceed 10 feet for single lane and 16 feet for double lane driveways. An individual driveway shall serve a maximum of four units.

SL5.1.8. Two resident parking stalls are required for each detached small lot unit and 1.5 resident parking stalls are required for each attached small lot unit.

[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-19:

Garages with common access

SL5.2.2. On-site garages may include both attached and detached structures.

SL5.2.3. Shared detached garages are allowed and can be used to meet resident parking requirements. Each housing unit shall be assigned a garage space and may share the structure with other homes.

SL5.2.4. A detached garage may be designed as a carriage house that includes a second floor accessory dwelling unit provided the building uses the same architecture as the principal building (see Figure 19.53.180-20). 
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-20:

Homes in Seabrook: Detached garage with accessory dwelling unit using architecture that is same as the principal residence

SL5.2.5. Driveways should be designed and located to minimize the appearance of the driveway and garage relative to pedestrian access, landscape, and livable portions of the home. Priority should be placed on the relationship of the rooms of the house or outdoor spaces to the street rather than the relationship of the garage to the street (see Figures 19.53.180-21, 19.53.180-22 and 19.53.180-23 for acceptable garage locations).

SL5.2.7. Garages should follow an architectural style similar to the homes. If sides are visible from streets, lanes, sidewalks, pathways, trails, or other homes, architectural details shall be incorporated in the design to minimize the impacts of the facade. Blank walls lacking windows, articulation or modulation are not permitted when facing a street. 

SL5.2.8. At least one garage stall per unit is encouraged.

F. SL6: Individual Outdoor Spaces.

Design Objective: To provide private outdoor space that encourages a sense of ownership by residents.

SL6.1. Approval Standards.

SL6.1.1. Outdoor spaces such as yards, decks, terraces, and patios shall be delineated from common space. Delineation may consist of walls, fences, berms, hedges, and landscaping (see Figure 19.53.180-28).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-28

Example of private open space in small lot neighborhood

SL6.1.2. Each unit shall have a minimum of 250 square feet of private yard with no dimension less than eight feet in width. For developments of three or fewer dwelling units, a minimum of 750 square feet of private yard shall be required.

SL6.1.3. Outdoor spaces used to meet these standards shall not be located within required landscape buffer areas. 

SL6.1.4. Outdoor spaces shall not be located adjacent to dumpster enclosures, loading/service areas, or other incompatible uses.

SL6.2. Design Guidelines.

SL6.2.1.   Planting areas should include the use of native plants when feasible.

SL6.2.2. Where landscape areas are provided, plant materials should be a mixture of deciduous and evergreen varieties. Designs are strongly encouraged to include a minimum 20 to 25 percent of plant varieties that will provide seasonal color, texture and/or other special interest.

SL6.2.3. Backyard patios and reciprocal use easements may be included in the calculation of private outdoor space. 

G. SL7: Common Open Spaces.

Design Objective: To visually unify a development, link development clusters and provide enhanced pedestrian friendly circulation within the development. 

SL7.1. Approval Standards.

SL7.1.1. Projects shall be sited to maximize opportunities for creating usable, well-integrated open space.

SL7.1.2. Pocket Parks.

a. A minimum of one half-acre park or central open space area (pocket park) shall be required for developments exceeding 10 acres of net developable acreage. The remaining required common open space shall be provided through additional park area, common greens, or pedestrian entry easements. If a small lot development has less than 10 acres of buildable land, a park, common green, pocket park and/or pedestrian entry easement may be used to meet the common open space requirements.

b. Pocket parks shall be visible and open to the street or be designed to serve clusters of approximately six to 12 homes (see Figure 19.53.180-29).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-29

SL7.1.3. Common Open Space.

a. For small lot developments of four or more units, each unit shall provide at least 350 square feet of common open space. Developments of three or less dwelling units have no common open space requirement.

b. Common open space shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, and serve a minimum of four homes.

SL7.1.4. Pedestrian Easement. A pedestrian entry easement can be used to meet common open space requirements if it has a minimum width of 20 feet with a minimum five-foot wide sidewalk (see Figure 19.53.180-30).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-30

SL7.2. Design Guidelines.

SL7.2.1.  Stormwater ponds may be used to meet the common open space requirement if designed to be dry for 90 percent of the year. Such ponds shall be designed as a landscape amenity and shall not be fenced.

SL7.2.2.  In common open space areas, grass-crete or other pervious surfaces may be used for the purpose of meeting the 150-foot distance requirement for emergency vehicle access.

SL7.2.3. Open space areas should be used to visually unify a development, link development clusters and provide enhanced pedestrian circulation within the development. 

SL7.2.4. Common open space should be centrally located so that it is a focus for the neighborhood and be easily viewed from the street and homes for informal surveillance and security (see Figure 19.53.180-31). 
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.180-31

Common open space that is centrally located to the development

SL7.2.5. Clustering of buildings is encouraged to minimize small, narrow, unassigned strips in front of and between buildings. 

SL7.2.6. The location of all open space areas should take into account climatic factors such as sun orientation and prevailing winds. 

SL7.3. Public Trail and Park Improvements in Lieu of Common Open Space.

Design Objective: Provide incentives for projects that support development of public trails and parks identified within the City’s Parks, Recreation and Open Space (PROS) Plan.

SL7.3.1. On-site public trail construction and dedication may, at the City’s discretion, substitute on a square footage basis for common open space when the proposed trail is identified within the City’s PROS plan. The following requirements shall be met:

a. The trail must be identified within the PROS Plan.

b. The trail shall be constructed to City standards.

c. The trail must be dedicated to, and accepted by, the City as a public trail.

d. Trail dedication and construction shall reduce the required common open space on a square footage basis. For example, if the area of land dedicated for trail purposes is 50,000 square feet, an equivalent 50,000 square foot reduction in common open space shall be granted.

SL7.3.2. Improvement of off-site public parks and trails may, at the City’s discretion, be used to reduce common open space requirements when the proposed park or trail is identified within the PROS plan and the following requirements are met:

a. The public park or trail to be improved must be identified within the PROS plan, located on land owned by University Place, and be located no greater than 600 feet from the development. In the case of off-site trail improvements, a direct connection from the development to the trail must be provided.

b. The park or trail must be improved to City standards.

c. The park or trail improvements must be dedicated to, and accepted by, the City.

d. Public park and trail improvement shall reduce the required common open space by an area equivalent in value to 120 percent of the estimated value of the improvement. The monetary value of the off-site improvement shall be determined by the City based upon an estimate of the cost to University Place for the construction of similar improvements. The monetary value of the common open space area shall be determined by University Place based upon the market value of the land for residential use with utilities and other non-structural improvements in place.

H. SL8: Utility Areas and Accessory Structures.

Design Objective: To minimize the impact of utility locations and accessory structures. 

SL8.1. Approval Standards.

SL8.1.1. Above ground utility boxes shall be placed in alleyways or away from public gathering spaces to the extent practicable and shall be screened with landscaping, which may include fencing or berms. This provision does not apply to meters attached or placed next to buildings.

SL8.1.2. No more than one detached garage or other accessory structure shall be permitted per lot and shall be architecturally consistent with the principal structure.

SL8.1.3. Detached garages shall not exceed 18 feet to top of roof in height or more than 600 square feet in area.

SL8.1.5. Greenhouses, sheds, and other accessory structures (other than garages and carriage houses) shall not exceed 12 feet to top of roof in height or 150 square feet in area. 

SL8.1.6. Accessory structures shall be no closer than three feet from the interior side or rear property line or two feet from an alleyway. 

SL8.1.7. Overhangs and roof drainage may not encroach over property lines.

SL8.1.8. Accessory structures are not allowed in front yards.

SL8.2. Design Guidelines.

SL8.2.1. Utility boxes should be grouped, if possible.

SL8.2.2. Mailboxes may be clustered in accordance with U.S. Postal Service (USPS) standards. Clustered mailboxes shall be architecturally enhanced with materials and details typical of nearby small lot development architecture and carefully placed to not adversely affect the privacy of residents and serve the needs of the USPS (see Figure 19.53.180-32).


[IMAGE]

19.53.190 Building design.

A. SL9: Mass, Scale and Form.

Design Objective: To encourage residential development that establishes streetscape variety, avoids monotonous facades, is pedestrian in scale and compatible with surrounding properties.

SL9.1. Approval Standards.

SL9.1.1. Primary building forms shall be the dominating form while secondary formal elements shall include porches, principal dormers, or other significant features (see Figure 19.53.190-1). 
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-1

Primary building form should define the overall form of the house

SL9.1.2. The scale, mass and height of a new house or second/upper story additions shall be compatible with the existing neighborhood pattern specifically in relation to height and massing of adjacent homes. 

SL9.1.3. The primary building elevation oriented toward the street or common green shall have at least one articulation or change in plane. A minimum of at least one side articulation shall occur for side elevations facing streets or public spaces.

SL9.1.4. Primary articulations shall be a minimum of two feet in depth and extend at least 20 percent of the length of the building facade. Side articulations shall be a minimum of one foot in depth and extend at least 20 percent of the length of the building facade (see Figure 19.53.190-2).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-2

Primary and secondary building articulations avoid a monotonous streetscape appearance

SL9.1.5. Each home shall have a covered porch or main entry oriented towards the public realm.

SL9.1.6. Roof profiles shall define the form, scale and proportion of the home and building and reduce bulk.

SL9.1.7. The following bulk regulations shall apply:

	Maximum Size for Dwelling	Attached unit: 1,500 square feet. Detached unit: 2,000 square feet. Attached garages are included. Detached garages and carriage house ADU floor area are excluded. 

	Floor Area Ratio (FAR)	Maximum FAR for individual lots shall not exceed 0.45. Average FAR for all homes within a small lot development shall not exceed 0.40. FAR is calculated using a site’s buildable area, including private street area and excluding critical areas and their required associated buffers. See UPMC 19.45.080 for FAR standards.

	Maximum Height for Dwelling	30 feet (where minimum roof slope of 6:12 for all parts of the roof above 20 feet is provided). Otherwise, 20 feet.

	Maximum Height for Accessory Structure	18 feet for nonresidential structures. 21 feet for accessory structure containing a carriage house ADU.

	Maximum Size for Accessory Structure 	600 square feet on ground floor. Additional area allowed on second floor to accommodate a carriage house ADU.

SL9.2. Design Guidelines.

SL9.2.1. Use new two-story home designs and second story additions that minimize structural massing of the second floor – particularly in existing neighborhoods that are predominantly single-story. Avoid two-story homes with disproportionately large masses, monumental forms and sharp contrasts in height (see Figure 19.53.190-3).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-3

Avoid creating tall two-story exterior walls that are less compatible with single-story neighbors

SL9.2.2. Design of individual homes should provide interest and balance of bulk and mass. Design techniques include:

a. Second story setbacks stepped back from the first floor wall plane on at least two sides. On corner lots, the second story wall planes should be stepped back from the first floor wall planes along the street frontages (see Figures 19.53.190-4 and 19.53.190-5);
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-4

Interlocking upper and lower forms can make building composition more interesting


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-5

Setbacks of upper floors reduces visual appearance

b. Use horizontal elements to soften vertical elements (e.g., roof forms, decks);

c. Keep second floor exterior wall heights as low as possible;

d. Use roof forms that reduce bulk (e.g., use a number of hips and valleys); and 

e. Minimize use of tall, two-story design elements with no architectural relief.

SL9.2.3. Avoid creating long or tall blank walls, particularly on the front and side of the home. By breaking up the appearance of long side walls with steps in the building wall, windows, and/or other substantial articulation, the apparent building mass can be reduced (see Figures 19.53.190-6, 19.53.190-7, 19.53.190-8 and 19.53.190-9). Use changes in materials and appropriate architectural detailing that add scale to long walls.

[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-9

The massing of these homes is complementary, although individual building massing is unique. Homes in Seabrook employ a variety of roof forms and ridgeline orientations to the street, upper floor setbacks and other design elements to reduce apparent building mass.

SL9.2.4. Building massing should be varied by employing a variety of techniques, such as recessed and projecting porches, bay windows, dormers and varying planes or setbacks. As appropriate to the style of the house, the roof forms should be varied (see Figures 19.53.190-10 and 19.53.190-11).

B. SL10: Architectural Style.

Design Objective: To ensure that residential design contributes to the overall architectural character of University Place.

SL10.1. Approval Standards.

SL10.1.1. The architectural style of the house or building shall enhance the character of the neighborhood. 

SL10.1.2. The architectural form of the house or building shall be carefully designed to articulate the style of the house or building. 

SL10.2. Design Guidelines.

SL10.2.1. New homes should be designed with an identifiable architectural style that enhances the character of the existing neighborhood. Additions to existing homes should be designed to be compatible with the architectural style of the existing home. (Please refer to “A Field Guide to American Houses” by Virginia and Lee McAlester.)

SL10.2.2. Consider using the design vocabulary of a particular architectural style to define a home’s visual form. This can be achieved in the following ways:

a. Avoid an interior design-driven floor plan that does not consider the impacts to exterior building mass and rooflines. Floor plans and roof layouts should coordinate well to create the best three-dimensional design. 

b. Architectural elements of buildings (such as openings, doors, windows, etc.) and architectural features (like roof elements, columns, dormers, etc.) should be in proportion to the overall home design. 

SL10.2.3. Building articulation should be varied for visual interest and to provide relief from close adjacency of homes. Breaking up the building into smaller component parts will make it compatible to human scale and this can be achieved by employing a variety of techniques as follows:

a. Divide building into portions or segments compatible with the adjacent residential scale. Facades of long buildings shall be architecturally subdivided into shorter segments every 25 to 30 feet maximum. 

b. Long walls (over 10 to 15 feet) should have architectural detail or be staggered to provide shade and shadow. Vertical two-story elevations should contain some architectural relief such as windows or decks, unifying architectural elements such as a sill or header line in the surface of the wall (see Figure 19.53.190-15).

c. Use a few simple, well-proportioned building masses accented with a few smaller architectural elements, such as bay windows or dormers. Using too many elements can create a cluttered appearance. 

d. Accentuate the ground floor of the building by making it more substantially visual than upper stories. This can be achieved by using entry porticos and front porches or other articulation at the ground level. 

e. Use upper story setbacks or partial indentations for upper story features, such as balconies, outdoor moldings or cornices, to accentuate the horizontal levels of a building.

SL10.2.4. Building elevations should not be replicated across the street from each other or on adjacent parcels (see Figure 19.53.190-16).

SL12.1.5. Roof Color. A variety of roof colors shall be used within the development.

SL12.2. Design Guidelines.

SL12.2.1. Avoid bright color, reflective roofing material.

SL12.2.2. Overhangs and eaves should be detailed and proportioned to complement the architectural style of the home. For example, eaves ranging in size from 24 to 36 inches would be appropriate for a craftsman home. 

E. SL13: Materials and Colors.

Design Objective: To ensure that an appropriate range of building materials is used that enhances the quality of residential development.

SL13.1. Approval Standards.

SL13.1.1. Consistent pattern and application of exterior materials shall be used on new homes and additions in order to enhance the appearance and character in the existing neighborhood.

SL13.1.2. The combination of materials on a building facade shall be appropriate to its style and design.

SL13.1.3. Where more than one material is used, the following techniques shall be used:

a. Vertical Changes. Changes in materials in a vertical wall, such as from brick to wood, shall wrap the corners no less than 24 inches. The material change shall occur at an internal corner or a logical transition such as aligning with a window edge or chimney. Material transition shall not occur at an exterior corner (see Figure 19.53.190-26).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-26

Vertical material changes

b. Horizontal Changes. Transition in material on a wall surface, such as shingle to lap siding, will be required to have a material separation, such as a trim band board (see Figure 19.53.190-27).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-27

Horizontal material changes

c. Acceptable Exterior Wall Material. Wood, cement fiberboard, stucco, EIFS, brick and stone may be used. Simulated stone, wood, stone, or brick may be used to detail homes.

d. Trim may be wood, cement fiberboard, stucco, or stone materials. Trim is required around all doors and windows. The trim must be three and one-half inches wide minimum and used on all elevations.

e. Provide multiple colors on buildings to reflect material changes and individuality of the residence.

(1) Muted deeper tones, as opposed to vibrant primary colors, shall be the dominant colors.

(2) Although grey and beige are not excluded, these colors shall not be the dominant color used on homes or other structures within a development.

(3) Color palettes for all new structures, coded to the home elevations, shall be submitted for approval.

SL13.2. Design Guidelines.

SL13.2.1. Materials and colors should enhance the character and quality of residential development and be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood setting.

SL13.2.2. A variety of materials should be used to emphasize a differentiation between the various components of the building. The combination of materials on a building facade shall be appropriate to its style and design and be visually appealing to the pedestrian (see Figure 19.53.190-28).

 

	
[IMAGE]
	Figure 19.53.190-28

Homes in Seabrook: All exterior building colors and materials should be subtle and compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. These homes are visually appealing to a pedestrian because of the colors and materials used in this development.

SL13.2.3. Materials and colors should not be used to create a distinctly unique appearance for each attached unit within a single building. Materials and colors should be applied consistently to each attached unit within a building. 

SL13.2.4. Accent materials should not be used as the only exterior material on a home. They may be used to add interest and variety at a more intimate scale, such as along architectural elements such as cornices, or on portions of buildings or walls or details such as trim. Accent materials include stucco, brick, ceramic tile, stone and stone veneer (see Figures 19.53.190-29 and 19.53.190-30).

The use of a single material, stucco, and single or similar colors, has assisted in creating monotony in a neighborhood.

F. SL14: Other Design Elements.

Design Objectives: Design chimneys that reflect the architectural style of the homes. Design columns, trim work, and corner boards to add visual detail to the house, and integrate the gutters and downspouts into the home’s color scheme.

SL14.1. Approval Standards.

SL14.1.1. Chimneys above the roof shall be at least 20 inches by 24 inches as measured in the plan.

SL14.1.2. Wood-framed chimney enclosures are permitted; however, metal termination caps shall not be left exposed. These tops shall be shroud in a metal chimney surround. 

SL14.1.3. Columns (see Figure 19.53.190-31).

a. Character columns shall be round, fluted, or strongly related to the home’s architectural style.

b. Exposed four-by-four- and six-by-six-inch posts are prohibited.

SL14.1.4. Corners (see Figure 19.53.190-31).

a. Beveled and mitered corners are preferred where siding is used.

b. Metal corner clips or corner boards may also be used at corners where siding is used. Corner boards shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in width.

SL14.1.5. Gutters shall be painted or be of an integral color to closely match the body color or trim color. Gutters may also have a traditional metal appearance provided through the use of copper, aluminum, galvanized material or other metal.


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.190-31

Corner boards and columns

SL14.2. Design Guidelines.

SL14.2.1. Chimney form and shape should reflect the proportions of masonry tradition. Skinny long chimneys out of concert with the house proportions or not naturally anchored into the roof forms and walls are unacceptable.

SL14.2.2. Overly stylistic chimneys are discouraged. Chimney shape and profile should appropriately reflect the stylistic direction of the rest of the house.

SL14.2.3. Columns, trim, and corner boards should reflect the architectural character of the home.

SL14.2.4. Corner boards should be painted a home’s body color to deemphasize their visibility unless a contrasting trim color is traditionally used for a particular architectural style. For example, a craftsman style home typically would deemphasize its corner boards by avoiding the use of contrasting color paint. 

SL14.2.5. Gutters and downspouts should reflect the architectural character of the home. For example, half-round gutters are a traditional application for many traditional architectural designs.

G. SL15: Interior Sprinklers.

Design Objective: To enhance the safety of residents in the event of a fire. 

SL15.1. Design Guidelines.

SL15.1.1. Sprinklers are encouraged to be installed in all living spaces when not otherwise required by regulation.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 3(SL9 – SL15))).


19.53.200 Lighting.

SL16: Lighting.

Design Objective: To design lighting that provides safety, character and aesthetic benefits for the neighborhood, minimizes light pollution and encourages energy efficiency.

SL16.1. Approval Standards. 

SL16.1.1. Exterior lighting shall be designed as an integral part of the building and landscape design. All exterior lighting shall be prevented from projecting light upward either by placement beneath building eaves or by an integral shield of the fixture’s interiors as recommended by the manufacturer. 

SL16.1.2. Site plans and architectural plans shall include the location of fixtures, their design and the nature and level of the illumination they will provide.

SL16.1.3. The lighting for neighborhood streets, access lanes, alleyways, common greens, and parks shall be low intensity and shall be from the same family of fixtures.

SL16.1.4. Street lighting on neighborhood streets and access lanes within the boundary of a development shall be required.

a. Lighting facilities and fixtures shall be located outside public right-of-way unless owned, operated, and maintained by a power utility franchised by the City.

b. All street lighting fixtures shall be a maximum height of 16 feet. 

SL16.1.5. Sidewalks and pathways not otherwise illuminated by street lighting shall be lit with ornamental lighting fixtures. All pedestrian lighting fixtures shall be a maximum height of 12 feet.

SL16.1.6. If alley lights are mounted on the garage, they shall be no higher than eight feet above ground and directed away from adjacent backyards and structures.

SL16.1.7. Lighting shall be limited to illumination of surfaces intended for pedestrians, vehicles, or key architectural features.

SL16.1.8. Street lights shall be placed on all internal roadways and perimeter roadways abutting the development per the design standards in UPMC 13.20.630. 

SL16.2. Design Guidelines.

SL16.2.1. Illumination levels should be provided to address security concerns, especially for parking lots, pedestrian paths, outdoor gathering spaces, at building entries and any other pedestrian accessible areas.

SL16.2.2. The light source for externally illuminated signs should be positioned so that light does not shine directly on adjoining properties, cause glare, or shine in the eyes of motorists or pedestrians.

SL16.2.3. Lighting should relate to the pedestrian scale of residential neighborhoods and should be considered a design element, rather than simply utilitarian. It should contribute to the character of development and should not impact adjacent development (see Figures 19.53.200-1 and 19.53.200-2).

SL16.2.4. Lighting sources should be kept as low to the ground as possible while ensuring safe and functional levels of illumination.

SL16.2.5. Area lighting should be directed downward or employ control features to avoid light being directed off site as well as to avoid lighting of the night sky.

SL16.2.6. In general, the location of lighting should respond to the anticipated use and not exceed the amount of illumination required by users.
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.200-1

Encouraged: Pedestrian-scaled decorative light fixtures add to the intimacy and character of a neighborhood.
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.200-2

Strongly discouraged: oversized utilitarian fixtures such as this “cobra head” example, which is out of scale with the surrounding homes and lends little character to the neighborhood.

SL16.2.7. Illumination over an entire area or the use of overly bright lighting is strongly discouraged. The use of a number of smaller lights (like bollard lighting) is preferable to larger, more intense lights (cobra head light fixtures).

SL16.2.8. Lighting for pedestrian movement should illuminate changes in grade, path intersections and other areas along paths which, if left unlit, would cause the user to feel insecure. Recommended minimum levels of illumination along pedestrian paths between destinations is 0.5 foot-candles. At pedestrian destination points such as entryways, plazas and courtyards, lighting levels should typically achieve illumination of one foot-candle.

SL16.2.9. The placement of light standards, whether for street lights or garden lights, should not interfere with pedestrian movement. Illumination should be concentrated along the pedestrian paths leading to parking areas and in the specific areas where cars are parked.

SL16.2.10. In order to conserve energy and reduce long-term costs, energy-efficient, Energy Star-certified lamps should be used for all lighting, and hours of operation should be monitored and limited to avoid waste. Low voltage lighting, and lighting activated through the use of photocells, motion sensors and automatic timers, should be used where feasible. 

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 3(SL16))).

Article IV-B. Multifamily Developments


19.53.210 Purpose and organization.

Multifamily developments are residential projects, with three or more units per building and multiple units on one parcel. Multifamily developments can be designed to accommodate rental or owner-occupied units (see Figure 19.53.210-1).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.210-1

Examples of small and large multifamily projects. Entrances are accentuated and the roofline is broken up to reduce the potential for monotony. Units are configured vertically, rather than horizontally, creating many views onto the street. Balconies provide private usable open space. A variety of complementary exterior finish materials is used to create visual interest.

These guidelines and standards are intended to: improve site planning to enhance the image of the City, reflect unique site characteristics, and provide strong neighborhood environments; develop site plans that preserve and integrate healthy and mature existing trees into the overall development scheme to establish optimum environmental conditions by providing shade, air purification, management of stormwater runoff, and other benefits; protect natural features and open space as much as possible to maintain the local character, and use and incorporate such features and areas as community amenities; and provide useable open space, or maintain significant natural areas, for the use and enjoyment by residents of the multifamily development.

Three design elements for multifamily development are listed below. Each element includes specific approval standard(s) and corresponding design guidelines to ensure that qualifying multifamily projects meet the City’s design expectations. 

Design Element 1: Site Planning and Design.

Design Element 2: Building Design.

Design Element 3: Lighting.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 3(B))).


19.53.220 Site planning and design.

A. MF1: Building Siting and Orientation.

Design Objective: Ensure that buildings relate appropriately to surrounding developments and streets; create a cohesive visual identity for the neighborhood and attractive street scene; promote efficient site layout in terms of vehicular and pedestrian circulation; and fit within the context of low impact development design.

MF1.1. Approval Standards.

MF1.1.1. Building Organization.

a. Multifamily buildings shall be clustered or grouped to form neighborhoods.

b. Multifamily buildings shall be organized around a common open space, public open space (e.g., a greenway), natural features located on the site (e.g., a stream corridor), or community amenities such as swimming pools or other recreational facilities. To the extent practicable, buildings should be oriented or arranged in a manner to enclose required common open spaces.

MF1.1.2. Building Orientation and Placement.

a. Individual buildings within a multifamily development shall be oriented to primary perimeter streets, including thoroughfares, or boundaries; or through-access drives. Specifically: 

i. Pedestrian building entrances shall face the street and be clearly visible from the street.

ii. Buildings shall not present blank walls lacking articulation, modulation, or window and door openings, to streets, access drives or parking areas (see Figure 19.53.220-1).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-1

Undesirable: Buildings with blank walls or with lack of articulation facing the street

iii. Building entries that face onto a common open space that is oriented towards the street are acceptable.

iv. Buildings shall also provide windows that face the street to provide “eyes on the street” for safety (see Figure 19.53.220-3). See UPMC 19.53.230(D), MF10: Windows and Doors, Porches and Balconies, for specific requirements.

b. Placement of buildings shall consider the existing context of the surrounding area. Multifamily developments shall respect privacy and solar access through appropriate siting of structures. Building setbacks around the perimeter of the site shall be consistent with the development standards of the underlying zoning district.

MF1.1.3. Privacy Assurance. When any portion of a building or structure within a multifamily development is located adjacent to property used or zoned for lower-density residential, the following standards shall apply to ensure the privacy of nearby residents:

a. To the maximum extent practicable, multifamily structures with fewer units or structures with one-story “end” units should be situated adjacent to property with low-density residential uses (see Figure 19.53.220-2).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-2

Desirable: Multifamily structures with fewer units or structures with one-story “end” units should be situated adjacent to property with low-density residential uses
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-3

In this multifamily project, units are configured vertically, rather than horizontally, creating many views onto the street.

b. Accessory structures, including garages and recreational facilities, shall be set back at least 25 feet from the adjacent low-density residential uses, and the developer shall provide a buffer between the structure and adjacent property. The buffer may be a fence, wall, heavy landscaping, or combination thereof. Fences and walls used for buffer purposes shall be a maximum of six feet in height, with finished side facing out.

MF1.2. Design Guidelines.

MF1.2.1. Residential development adjacent to designated open space areas should maintain visual access to the open space from residential units, common buildings, and/or streets (buildings should not back up to open space areas creating areas hidden from public view). Projects should also provide for future connections to currently undeveloped properties via public or private streets, internal drives and biking and walking trails.

MF1.2.2. Multifamily projects should be placed along the street or at street intersections with views from the units onto the street (see Figure 19.53.220-3).

MF1.2.3. Building Orientation to Street Edges.

a. Buildings along a public street should be oriented to avoid multiple parallel orientations to a public street (see Figure 19.53.220-4). Instead, a variety of building orientations, including perpendicular and canted, or intervening open spaces should be provided to lessen the mass of buildings along the street.
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-4

Undesirable: Buildings with multiple parallel building orientations with rear elevations facing street

b. Multiple buildings may line up parallel to a public street if:

i. A building entrance faces the perimeter street;

ii. Individual building length along the street frontage is a maximum of 100 feet; and

iii. Common open space is centrally located in the interior of the site and accessible by all units.

B. MF2: Grading and Stormwater Management.

Design Objective: To minimize modifications to topography, preserve existing vegetation whenever possible, minimize the creation of impervious surfaces, and maximize stormwater infiltration within the development site and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off site through the use of LID techniques. 

MF2.1. Approval Standards.

MF2.1.1.  Structures, roadways and other site improvements (drainageways and storage areas) shall be designed to blend with the natural topography, with a minimum of site disturbance and grade changes. 

MF2.1.2.  LID techniques shall be used to the maximum extent feasible, as determined by a development site’s soil characteristics, to maximize stormwater infiltration within the site and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off site.

MF2.1.3. Stormwater facilities that are required to supplement LID facilities may include either stormwater ponds or underground vaults. Stormwater ponds shall be designed as a landscape amenity and planted with grass or native plants (see Figure 19.53.220-5). Stormwater ponds shall be privately owned and maintained, shall not be fenced, and shall not exceed a four horizontal to one vertical slope. Stormwater ponds may be used to meet open space requirements if designed utilizing the KCSWDM.
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-5

MF2.1.4. Filling and grading shall be done in accordance with Chapter 13.25 UPMC and the King County Surface Water Design Manual (KCSWDM) to control stormwater runoff impacts to adjacent properties.

MF2.2. Design Guidelines.

MF2.2.1.  Multifamily developments should integrate existing natural features, required open space, and existing historic structures or cultural resources located on site into the overall design and layout of the development. Existing natural features, as well as the required common open space, should be used to create community amenities and provide physical separations and buffers from adjacent development, where needed. The site plan should reflect natural hydrology and minimize impervious surfaces. 

a.  Preserve or design into the infrastructure naturally vegetated areas that are in close proximity to parking areas, buildings, and other impervious expanses in order to slow runoff, filter out pollutants, and facilitate infiltration.

b.  Direct runoff into or across vegetated areas to help filter runoff and encourage groundwater recharge.

c.  Use native plants (or adaptable species) to establish an adaptable and low maintenance landscape that requires less irrigation and is appropriate for the climatic conditions.

d.  Use devices such as bioretention cells, vegetated swales, infiltration trenches, and dry wells to increase storage volume and facilitate infiltration. 

e.  Plant bioswales with native grass to further improve water quality. Bioswales are encouraged throughout the development to treat runoff, improve water quality, and minimize or eliminate the size of detention ponds (see Figure 19.53.220-6). 
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-6

Vegetated bioswale

f.  Disconnect impervious areas from the storm drain network and maintain natural drainage divides to keep flow paths dispersed. Maximize infiltration using: biofilters, green strips, swales and permeable materials in lieu of hardscapes.

g.  Incorporate perennial streams, wetlands, and associated riparian corridors into site plans and site design as major amenities, with trails, seating, and appropriate supplemental vegetation. Buildings, parking areas, and other structures should be set back from such features a sufficient distance to ensure their continued quality and natural functions (see Figure 19.53.220-7).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-7

Perennial streams, wetlands, and associated riparian corridors shall be incorporated into the overall site design of multifamily development

MF2.2.2.  Surface water and pollutant runoff should be reduced by maximizing the use of pervious surfaces and vegetative groundcover.

a.  Use of permeable paving, pavers, turf stone, brick, and decomposed granite is encouraged.

b.  Use of natural topographic features or built swales for filtration of site drainage is encouraged.

c.  Porous concrete, porous paving stones, reinforced turf, crushed gravel with soil stabilizers, and paving blocks with planted joints are examples of acceptable materials that can be used for driveways, pathways, sidewalks, and patios.

MF2.2.3.  To the maximum extent feasible, the layout of multifamily developments shall follow and respect the natural topography of the site. Berms, channels, swales, and similar man-made changes to the landscape shall be designed and graded to be an integral part of the natural landscape and to provide a smooth transition in changes of slope.

MF2.2.4.  Existing trees and vegetation should be preserved whenever possible to act as buffers between adjoining developments and as community amenities within the development per Chapter 19.65 UPMC (see Figure 19.53.220-8). Buildings, parking areas, and other structures should be set back from such features a sufficient distance to ensure their continued quality and natural functions.


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-8

Existing trees and vegetation should be preserved whenever possible

MF2.2.5. The “effective” impervious surface should be minimized to the extent practicable while achieving urban densities consistent with the goals of accommodating multifamily development and expanding housing choice in the community. 

C. MF3: Parking.

Design Objective: To ensure that parking areas do not dominate the views of residential development from public streets and sidewalks.

MF3.1. Approval Standards.

MF3.1.1. Carports, parking areas and parking structures shall be internalized in building groupings or oriented away from street frontage.

MF3.1.2. Parking areas and freestanding parking structures (detached garages or carports) shall not occupy more than 30 percent of each public street frontage. Freestanding parking structures that are visible from public streets shall be sited to be perpendicular to the street to reduce visual impacts on the streetscape. Blank walls lacking windows, articulation or modulation are not permitted when facing a street (see Figure 19.53.220-9).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-9

Undesirable: Shared detached garage is oriented parallel to the street and presents blank wall to the sidewalk

MF3.1.3. Total number of required parking spaces shall be broken up into smaller “blocks” of parking, with no more than 10 parking spaces per parking block (see Figure 19.53.220-10).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-10

Desirable: Parking for this multifamily project is broken into smaller parking “blocks” with direct access to buildings

MF3.1.4. Parking garages and driveways shall not dominate the streetscape and substantially diminish or eliminate on-street parking (see Figures 19.53.220-11 and 19.53.220-12). They shall be designed and sited to complement, not subordinate, the pedestrian entry.

Figure 19.53.220-11

Undesirable: Parking is the dominant feature when viewed from the street. The ground floor building facade is devoted mostly to garage doors and the frontage has a continuous driveway apron with no curbside parking.
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-12

Desirable: These garages face an internal driveway and are deemphasized through the use of overhanging balconies, landscaping and accent building elements and materials. The tandem parking configuration of the garages also limits their visibility.

M3.2. Design Guidelines.

MF3.2.1. Design and locate parking areas such that the walk from the designated parking to the dwellings is short and direct. Ideally, residents will be able to view their parking stalls from their residence. All resident and visitor parking spaces shall be clearly identified.

MF3.2.2. Buffer residential units from the parking lot by:

a. Providing a landscaped screen with a minimum height of three feet (berm, hedge, wall, or other);

b. Providing a minimum 10-foot-wide landscaped area between paved areas and residential units.

MF3.2.3. Use a combination of on-street and off-street parking for multifamily development. Parallel parking along local streets within multifamily projects is strongly encouraged (see Figure 19.53.220-13).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.220-13

Desirable: Parking along the primary access road is accommodated with pop-ins that take the cars out of the roadway to allow for better circulation and reduced right-of-way width. A landscaping strip is placed between the parking area and the sidewalk to protect the pedestrians.
[IMAGE]


D. MF4: Common Open Spaces.

Design Objective: To create areas of common open space that are easily accessed by residents; provide focal points for community recreation and interaction and add to the overall quality of life for residents.

Design Objective: To encourage residential development that is scaled to the pedestrian and is compatible with surrounding properties.

MF7.1. Approval Standards.

MF7.1.1. Multifamily building design shall incorporate visually heavier and more massive elements at the building base, and lighter elements above the base. A second story, for example, should not appear heavier or demonstrate greater mass than the part of the building supporting it.

MF7.1.2. The massing of larger residential buildings shall be broken down to convey a sense of “home,” and give individuality to each unit that lies within it. Design techniques to reduce mass include:

a. Articulation such as dormers, overhangs, balconies, wall projections, and porches;

b. Varied roof form as appropriate to the style of the building, such as: hipped roofs, gabled roofs, varying roof pitches, and roof dormers;

c. Material changes to create variations; and

d. Staggered and jogged unit plans.

MF7.1.3. Building massing shall be subdivided into portions or segments compatible with the adjacent residential scale.

MF7.1.4. Facades of long buildings shall be architecturally subdivided into shorter segments every 25 to 50 feet maximum, using the methods identified in the design guidelines, below.

MF7.1.5. Each vertical module of units shall incorporate architectural features that help to individually distinguish them, such as wall breaks, projections, distinct color schemes and individual roof treatments.

MF7.1.6. Roof profiles shall define the form, scale and proportion of the building and reduce bulk.

MF7.2. Design Guidelines.

MF7.2.1. Building design should resemble the scale of single-family residential architecture as much as possible, and units should be differentiated by using one or more of the following methods:

a. Separate building volumes or facade protrusions.

b. Window bays or balconies.

c. Porches and entrance vestibules.

d. Individual roof volumes and other roof articulation.

MF7.2.2. Building facades should incorporate the following features to architecturally distinguish modules of housing units (see Figure 19.53.230-1):


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.230-1

Examples of building modulation through vertical architectural features, offsetting portions of buildings or individualized roof forms

a. Vertical Architectural Features.

i. Apply a vertical slot or recess between facade segments with a six-inch minimum recess depth and a 15-inch minimum width.

ii. Apply a vertical pilaster between facades with a three-inch minimum protrusion and a 15-inch minimum width. 

iii. Project a part of the building, such as a tower, above the main building volume.

b. Building Wall.

i. Vary the offset of portions of the building along the main facade, using elements such as bays or building volumes to create the offset.

ii. Change the color or material of segments across the facade. Material changes should always be accompanied by a change in plane and separated by framing or other means. 

c. Individualized Roof Forms.

i. Use individual roof pitches to break up the form. For example, a single building could express individual units through a series of smaller gabled dormers.

ii. Subdivide flat roofs into recognizable segments with shifts in height and cornice treatments at street facades.

MF7.2.3. When located adjacent to one- or two-story single-family homes, the design of multi-unit structures along the project edge should be designed to transition in scale (see Figure 19.53.230-2). Building massing should be legible as individual residences or small groups of units. This can be achieved by:
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.230-2

Poor transition: Newer multifamily homes surround an existing single-family dwelling, causing architectural disparity as well as loss of privacy for the single-family home.

a. Subdividing perimeter buildings into segments compatible with adjacent residential scale (e.g., upper story setbacks);

b. Accentuating the ground floor of the building by making it thicker or more substantial visually than upper stories;

c. Using entry porticos and front porches or other articulation at the ground level;

d. Using upper story setbacks or partial indentations for upper story features, such as balconies, outdoor moldings or cornices, to accentuate the horizontal levels of a building;

e. Separate building volumes or facade protrusions; and

f. Individual roof volumes and other roof articulation (see Figures 19.53.230-3 and 19.53.230-4).
[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.230-6

Do not do this

This multifamily project lacks architectural style and detailing. The building appears massive and uninviting as it backs onto the street.

C. MF9: Facades and Entries.

Design Objective: To provide a distinctive, quality, architectural character in new multifamily developments. In particular, architectural details help to reduce the visual scale of large multifamily buildings and ensure that residential development relates to the human scale, facilitates opportunities for pedestrian activity on adjoining public streets and contributes to a community-oriented character for residential neighborhoods.

MF9.1. Approval Standards.

MF9.1.1. All building entries adjacent to a collector or residential (local) public street or to a public street or private drive with on-street parking shall be pedestrian-scaled. Pedestrian-scaled entries are those that provide an expression of human activity or use in relation to building size. Doors, windows, entranceways, and other features such as corners, setbacks, and offsets can be used to create pedestrian scale.

MF9.1.2. Buildings with long facades must use design techniques to break up long continuous building walls, reduce the architectural scale of the building and add visual interest. The following standards apply to buildings with long facades (see Figure 19.53.230-7).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.230-7

Maximum facade width standards

3. Area of Illumination.

MF13.1.5. The light source for externally illuminated signs must be positioned so that light does not shine directly on adjoining properties, cause glare, or shine in the eyes of motorists or pedestrians.

4. Prohibited Lights.

MF13.1.6. No outdoor lights shall be permitted that blink, revolve, flash or change intensity.

MF13.12 Design Guidelines.

1. Lighting Design.

MF13.2.1. Pedestrian-scaled decorative light fixtures, such as gooseneck lighting, are strongly encouraged (see Figure 19.53.240-1).
[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.240-1

Encouraged: Pedestrian-scaled decorative light fixtures add to the intimacy and character of a neighborhood.

MF13.2.2. Lighting should generally be designed to include cut-offs to minimize the lighting of the sky.

MF13.2.3. In order to conserve energy and reduce long-term costs, energy-efficient, Energy Star-certified lamps should be used for all lighting, and hours of operation should be monitored and limited to avoid waste.

2. Lighting Height.

MF13.2.4. Lighting sources should be kept as low to the ground as possible while ensuring safe and functional levels of illumination.

MF13.2.5. Area lighting should be directed downward or employ control features to avoid light being directed offsite as well as to avoid lighting of the night sky.

3. Area of Illumination.

MF13.2.5. Lighting should be located to minimize the impact of lighting upon adjacent buildings and properties, especially residential uses. In general, the location of lighting should respond to the anticipated use and not exceed the amount of illumination required by users.

MF13.2.6. Illumination over an entire area or the use of overly bright lighting is strongly discouraged. The use of a number of smaller lights is preferable to larger, more intense lights.

MF13.2.7. Lighting for pedestrian movement should illuminate changes in grade, path intersections and other areas along paths which, if left unlit, would cause the user to feel insecure. Recommended minimum levels of illumination along pedestrian paths between destinations is 0.5 foot-candles. At pedestrian destination points such as entryways, plazas and courtyards, lighting levels should typically achieve illumination of one foot-candle.

MF13.2.8. The placement of light standards, whether for street lights or garden lights, should not interfere with pedestrian movement.

4. Parking Area Illumination.

MF13.2.9. Illumination should be concentrated along the pedestrian paths leading to parking areas and in the specific areas where cars are parked.

MF13.2.10. Illumination should achieve a lighting level of one foot-candle on the parking lot surface.

5. Lighting Efficiency.

MF13.2.11. In order to conserve energy and reduce long-term costs, energy-efficient, Energy Star-certified lamps should be used for all lighting, and hours of operation should be monitored and limited to avoid waste. Low voltage lighting, and lighting activated through the use of photocells, motion sensors and automatic timers, should be used where feasible.

(Ord. 559 § 6 (Exh. A § 3(MF13))).

Article V. Landscape Design Standards and Guidelines


19.53.250 Purpose.

Landscaping standards and guidelines are intended to provide visual enhancement of the City; to protect and promote the appearance, character and economic value of property; to reduce visibility of paved areas and other unsightly views from adjacent properties and public lands; to moderate climatic effects; to minimize noise and glare; to enhance public safety by defining spaces to influence traffic movement; to reduce stormwater runoff; and to provide visual transition between neighboring properties. Landscaping is an important aspect of the creation of space and scale and enables builders to create a transition between homes and the street while mitigating the impact of denser housing.

A. L1: General Landscape Design.

Design Objective: To ensure development plans include landscape elements that contribute positively to the character of small lot and multifamily neighborhoods.

L1.1. Approval Standards.

L1.1.1. Landscaping shall be an integral part of the overall site design, rather than camouflage unused or unusable spaces or poor architectural design.

L1.1.2. Larger, more mature plant materials shall be used as much as possible to ensure that some immediate effect on the project’s appearance will be attained within two years of planting.

L1.1.3. All landscaped public or common areas and front yard landscaping within a development shall be required to have automatic irrigation systems or xeriscape concepts to ensure plant survival.

L1.2. Design Guidelines.

L1.2.1.  Landscape improvements should be utilized to better integrate a development with its setting by:

a. Enhancing pedestrian scale of buildings;

b. Screening views of unsightly elements, such as utility boxes and backflow devices; 

c. Softening hard edges visually;

d. Providing a transition between different use areas; 

e. Creating an attractive aesthetic environment;

f. Creating usable pedestrian areas;

g. Reducing energy consumption; and

h. Defining specific areas and enhancing architectural features (see Figure 19.53.250-1).

Landscaping integrates site design with existing trees to provide screening and shade.

L1.2.2.  Where feasible, significant existing trees and other landscape elements should be preserved and incorporated into development and landscape plans. Landscape plans should exhibit a well-coordinated design concept. Plant materials should be utilized in an orderly manner which defines the site’s spatial organization and function, relates to the buildings and structures and incorporates the various site elements including existing vegetation.

L1.2.3.  Landscape areas shall utilize xeriscape concepts which: minimize the amount of turf area, use plant material that has a low water demand and use a segmented irrigation system calibrated to the specific water demands of various turf, plant and tree groups.

L1.2.4.  Swales are strongly recommended to reduce water quality impacts associated with site runoff (see Figure 19.53.250-2).


[IMAGE]


Figure 19.53.250-2

Low wall accompanied by landscaping and swale between street and sidewalk.

L1.2.5. Xeriscape Guidelines.

a.  All landscaping should employ features and techniques that in the aggregate reduce the demand for and consumption of water, including appropriate low-water-using plants, nonliving groundcover, a low percentage of lawn coverage, a high degree of paving permeability and water conserving irrigation techniques and systems.

b.  The use of turf should be minimized or substituted altogether with groundcovers. Turf should be excluded from median or sidewalk strips, steep slopes, and other areas which are difficult to irrigate and maintain. Low-water-using grass varieties are encouraged.

c.  Water efficient irrigation systems, such as drip, low output sprinkler heads, zonal systems and automatic timers, should be provided. Planting should be according to water needs, and the irrigation system matched to these needs.

d.  Plant varieties should be low water consuming, suited to the local soil and climate and grouped according to their water requirements. For instance, sprinklers for turf areas should be installed with a separate irrigation valve from irrigation valves used for other vegetation.

e.  Mulches should be used generously and reapplied as part of a regular maintenance program to add nutrients and reduce evaporation, soil compaction and weeds. Mulches comprised of fully composted organic matter should be used in lieu of bark mulches, which do not provide much nutrient value to planting beds. 

L1.2.6. The following are common planting design concepts that should be used whenever possible:

a. Specimen trees used in informal grouping and rows at major focal points;

b. A wide variety of plant species;

c. Extensive use of flowering vines both on walls and arbors;

d. Pots, vases, wall or raised planters;

e. The use of plantings to create shadow and patterns against walls;

f. Trees to create canopy and shade, especially in parking areas;

g. The use of flowering trees in informal groups to provide color;

h. Informal massing of colorful plantings;

i. The use of distinctive plants as focal points; and

j. Berms, plantings, and low walls to screen parking areas from view of public rights-of-way while allowing filtered views of larger buildings beyond.

L1.2.7.  In general and where feasible, plant preservation should take precedence over transplanting, transplanting over planting new, and planting native over ornamental species.

L1.2.8.  The use of plant species native to the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest is strongly encouraged to reduce water consumption and lower maintenance costs. Noninvasive naturalized species that have adapted to the climatic conditions of the region may be used to supplement native plants.

L1.2.9. Existing topsoil should be used where feasible. The clearing and site preparation of larger development areas should save and stockpile existing topsoil for plant adaptation.

L1.2.10. Planting areas between walls or fences and streets should be landscaped with a hierarchy of plant sizes (taller near the wall or fence to shorter near the street) in natural formations and groupings. 

B. L2: Yard Landscape Design.

Design Objective: To ensure development plans include yard landscape elements that contribute positively to the character of residential neighborhoods.

L2.1. Approval Standards.

L2.1.1. Front yard landscaping shall reinforce other design elements of the home through the use of vines on trellises, hedges, or low fences or walls (see Figure 19.53.250-3).

	CHECKLIST FOR SMALL LOT DEVELOPMENT RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS	Y	N	Comments

	Design Element 1: Site Planning and Design

	SL1: Building Siting and Orientation 

	Site design elements display a clear and unified organization of building, landscaping and circulation elements that support the functions of the site.	 	 	 

	The placement of buildings considers the existing context of the surrounding area. 	 	 	 

	Attached units are separated from other attached units on the same block face by one or more detached units.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines SL1.2.1 – SL1.2.9 for design guidelines that help meet the “Site Planning and Design” criterion)	 	 	 

	SL2: Grading and Stormwater Management

	Structures, roadways and other site improvements (drainage ways and storage areas) are designed to blend with the natural topography, with a minimum of site disturbance and grade changes. 	 	 	 

	Low impact development (LID) techniques are used to the extent practicable, as determined by a development site’s soil characteristics, to maximize stormwater infiltration within the site and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off site.	 	 	 

	Stormwater ponds are designed as a landscape amenity and planted with grass or native plants.	 	 	 

	Stormwater ponds are not fenced, and do not exceed a 4 horizontal to 1 vertical slope.	 	 	 

	Stormwater ponds are designed in accordance with the King County Integrated Pond Manual.	 	 	 

	A maximum of 50 percent of the front yard between the facade of the home and front property line is paved or covered with impervious surface. 	 	 	 

	Filling and grading is in accordance with Chapter 13.25 UPMC and the King County Surface Water Design Manual (KCSWDM).	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines SL2.2.1 – SL2.2.5 for design guidelines that help meet the “Grading and Stormwater Management” criterion)

	The building placement is configured to support the neighborhood’s existing site patterns, including building location, setbacks and yard areas.	 	 	 

	Minimum lot width for homes with front-loaded and side-loaded garages is 40 feet. No minimum is specified for alley-loaded and other garage designs.	 	 	 

	The building setbacks ensure separation of homes and private spaces while allowing moderate density. Small-lot homes complement existing setback patterns in terms of distance to the street and spacing between homes while considering smaller lot sizes and the need for private open space.	 	 	 

	If necessary, reciprocal side and/or rear yard use easements are delineated on the site plan.	 	 	 

	If necessary, where a side yard easement is used, the wall facing the side yard is constructed as a “privacy wall.” In this case privacy walls do not have doors entering into the yard space of the adjacent home, nor have windows that are within 5 feet of ground level. 	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines SL3.2.1 – SL3.2.3 for design guidelines that help meet the “Lot Standards” criterion)	 	 	 

	SL4: Front Yards / Entrances

19.53.270 Checklist for multifamily development residential projects.

	Project Name: _____________________________

	Date of Review: ____________________________

	CITY OF UNIVERSITY PLACE DESIGN CRITERIA AND STANDARDS	Proposed Project

	CHECKLIST FOR MULTIFAMILY LOT DEVELOPMENT RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS	Y	N	Comments

	Design Element 1: Site Planning and Design

	MF1: Building Siting and Orientation 

	Multifamily buildings are clustered or grouped to form neighborhoods.	 	 	 

	Multifamily buildings are organized around a common open space, public open space (e.g., a greenway), natural features located on the site (e.g., a stream corridor), or community amenities such as swimming pools or other recreational facilities. 	 	 	 

	Individual buildings within a multifamily development are oriented to primary perimeter streets, including thoroughfares, or boundaries; or through-access drives. 	 	 	 

	Pedestrian building entrances face the street and are clearly visible from the street.	 	 	 

	Buildings do not present blank walls lacking articulation, modulation, or window and door openings, to streets, access drives or parking areas.	 	 	 

	Buildings provide windows that face the street to provide “eyes on the street” concept for safe streets.	 	 	 

	Placement of buildings considers the existing context of the surrounding area. Multifamily developments respect privacy and solar access through appropriate siting of structures.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF1.2.1 – MF1.2.2 for design guidelines that help meet the “Building Siting and Orientation” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF2: Grading and Stormwater Management

	Structures, roadways and other site improvements (drainage ways and storage areas) are designed to blend with the natural topography, with a minimum of site disturbance and grade changes.	 	 	 

	Low impact development (LID) techniques are used to the extent practicable, as determined by a development site’s soil characteristics, to maximize stormwater infiltration within the site and minimize the amount of stormwater that is transferred off site.	 	 	 

	Stormwater ponds are designed as a landscape amenity and planted with grass or native plants.	 	 	 

	Stormwater ponds are not fenced, and do not exceed a 4 horizontal to 1 vertical slope.	 	 	 

	Filling and grading is in accordance with Chapter 13.25 UPMC and the King County Surface Water Design Manual (KCSWDM) to control stormwater runoff impacts to adjacent properties.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF2.2.1 – MF2.2.5 for design guidelines that help meet the “Grading and Stormwater Management” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF3: Parking

	Carports, parking areas and parking structures are internalized in building groupings or oriented away from street frontage.	 	 	 

	Parking areas and freestanding parking structures (detached garages or carports) do not occupy more than 30 percent of each public street frontage. Freestanding parking structures that are visible from public streets are sited to be perpendicular to the street to reduce visual impacts on the streetscape. 	 	 	 

	Total number of required parking spaces is broken up into smaller “blocks” of parking, with no more than 10 parking spaces per parking block.	 	 	 

	Parking garages and driveways do not dominate the streetscape and substantially diminish or eliminate on-street parking.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF3.2.1 – MF3.2.3 for design guidelines that help meet the “Parking” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF4: Common Open Spaces

	New development sets aside a percentage of the net site acreage as common open space for the use and enjoyment of the development’s residents. The minimum amount of open space (as a percentage of net land area) is 17%. 	 	 	 

	Open space areas are clearly identified on the development plan. Common outdoor spaces shall provide at least 6 amenities from the design standards list to accommodate a variety of ages and activities.	 	 	 

	To the maximum extent practicable, common open space land is compact and contiguous unless the land is used as a continuation of an existing greenway, trail, or other linear park, or unless specific topographic features require a different configuration.	 	 	 

	Common open space is organized to create integrated systems of open space that connect with open space, parks, schools, etc. 	 	 	 

	Common open space is accessible to all residents of the development.	 	 	 

	A variety of common open spaces is provided throughout the neighborhood in the form of parks, common greens, pocket parks, and pedestrian easements.	 	 	 

	Where common open space is bordered by private rear or side yards, opaque fences and walls are not erected in such yards bordering the open space. 	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF4.2.1 – MF4.2.2 for design guidelines that help meet the “Common Open Spaces” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF5: Accessory Structures 

	The design of the mailboxes and mailbox enclosures is consistent with the architectural style of the development and matches the colors and materials of other on-site buildings.	 	 	 

	Mailboxes are clustered and lockable consistent with U.S. Postal Service (USPS) standards.	 	 	 

	Trash enclosures are of sufficient size to house the number and size of trash bins and containers needed to accommodate the waste generated by the building user, including trash, cardboard, cans and bottles, food waste, green waste and other recyclables.	 	 	 

	Trash enclosures are integrated into the site plan to minimize enclosure visibility and accommodate truck access.	 	 	 

	Trash enclosures are constructed of durable materials and the color, texture, and architectural detailing is consistent with the overall site and building design.	 	 	 

	Backflow prevention devices are included in the plans for design review and are screened from public view by the use of landscaping, berms, low walls and other such screening devices.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF5.2.1 – MF5.2.7 for design guidelines that help meet the “Accessory Structures” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF6: Signage

	Signage contributes to the development’s identity as a unique environment. Professionally designed, creative signage is strongly encouraged, especially for internal directions and building identification.	 	 	 

	Clear legible entry signage is provided to identify the development. Internal circulation signage and visitor parking areas are also clearly indicated. 	 	 	 

	Building numbers and individual unit numbers are readily visible from the nearest street or access way, in a consistent location, well lit at night, and compatible with the overall design of the development.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF6.2.1 – MF6.2.3 for design guidelines that help meet the “Signage” criterion)	 	 	 

	Design Element 2: Building Design 

	MF7: Mass, Scale and Form

	Multifamily building designs incorporate visually heavier and more massive elements at the building base, and lighter elements above the base.	 	 	 

	The massing of larger residential buildings is broken down to convey a sense of “home,” and give individuality to each unit that lies within it.	 	 	 

	Building massing is subdivided into portions or segments compatible with the adjacent residential scale.	 	 	 

	Facades of long buildings are architecturally subdivided into shorter segments every 25 to 50 feet.	 	 	 

	Each vertical module of units incorporate architectural features that help to individually distinguish them, such as wall breaks, projections, distinct color schemes and individual roof treatments.	 	 	 

	Roof profiles define the form, scale and proportion of the building and reduce bulk.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF7.2.1 – MF7.2.3 for design guidelines that help meet the “Mass, Scale and Form” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF8: Architectural Style

	Architectural style of the building enhances the character of the neighborhood.	 	 	 

	The architectural form of the building is carefully designed to articulate the style of the building.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF8.2.1 – MF8.2.2 for design guidelines that help meet the “Architectural Styles” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF9: Facades and Entries

	All building entries adjacent to a collector or residential (local) public street or to a public street or private drive with on-street parking are pedestrian-scaled. Pedestrian-scaled entries are those that provide an expression of human activity or use in relation to building size. Doors, windows, entranceways, and other features such as corners, setbacks, and offsets are used to create pedestrian scale.	 	 	 

	Buildings with long facades use design techniques to break up long continuous building walls, reduce the architectural scale of the building and add visual interest. 	 	 	 

	Fronts of buildings are articulated through the use of bays, insets, balconies, porches, or stoops related to entrances and windows.	 	 	 

	When there are common entries, they are clearly identifiable and visible from the street, with well-defined walkways from pedestrian routes to building entries.	 	 	 

	Front yards include an entrance sequence between the sidewalk and the building including elements such as trellises, site furnishings, low hedges, landscaped borders, and special paving.	 	 	 

	Facades facing streets are not dominated by garage doors and driveways, or present blank walls lacking articulation, modulation, or window and door openings.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF9.2.1 – MF9.2.2 for design guidelines that help meet the “Facades and Entries” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF10: Windows and Doors, Porches and Balconies

	All multifamily building elevations contain windows, except when necessary to assure privacy for adjacent property owners.	 	 	 

	All windows within a building and across a facade relate in design, operating type, proportions and trim.	 	 	 

	Windows are used as architectural elements that add relief to the facade and wall surface.	 	 	 

	Windows employ design details, if appropriate to the architecture, such as mullions, to break the scale of the facade into smaller components.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF10.2.1 – MF10.2.8 for design guidelines that help meet the “Windows and Doors, Porches and Balconies” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF11: Materials and Color

	Consistent pattern and application of exterior materials is used on new buildings and additions in order to enhance the appearance and character in the existing neighborhood.	 	 	 

	The combination of materials on a building facade is appropriate to its style and design.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF11.2.1 – MF11.2.6 for design guidelines that help meet the “Material and Color” criterion)	 	 	 

	MF12: Roof Design

	Roof materials relate to the design and architectural style of the building.	 	 	 

	Pitched roofs on multifamily buildings have a minimum slope ratio of 6:12.	 	 	 

	On buildings where sloping roofs are the predominant roof type, each building has a variety of roof forms. For instance, a gable or hip configuration is used with complimentary sheds, dormers, and other minor elements. Other roof forms will be considered on a case-by-case basis.	 	 	 

	Roof forms are designed to correspond and denote building elements and functions such as entrances and arcades.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guideline MF12.2.1 for a design guideline that helps meet the “Roof Design” criterion)	 	 	 

	Design Element 3: Lighting

	MF13: Lighting Design

	Exterior lighting is designed as an integral part of the building and landscape design.	 	 	 

	Site plans and architectural plans include the location of fixtures, their design and the nature and level of the illumination they will provide.	 	 	 

	Illumination levels are provided to address security concerns, especially for parking lots, pedestrian paths, outdoor gathering spaces, at building entries and any other pedestrian accessible areas.	 	 	 

	The height of luminaries is in scale with the building and site design and in no case shall the height exceed 16 feet in height from grade.	 	 	 

	The light source for externally illuminated signs is positioned so that light does not shine directly on adjoining properties, cause glare, or shine in the eyes of motorists or pedestrians.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines MF13.2.1 – MF13.2.11 for design guidelines that help meet the “Lighting Design” criterion)

	CITY OF UNIVERSITY PLACE DESIGN CRITERIA AND STANDARDS	Proposed Project

	CHECKLIST FOR LANDSCAPING AND PLANTING REQUIREMENTS	Y	N	Comments

	L1: General Landscape Design 

	Landscaping is an integral part of the overall site design, rather than functioning as a camouflage for unused or unusable spaces or poor architectural design.	 	 	 

	Larger, more mature plant materials are used as much as possible to ensure that some immediate effect on the project’s appearance will be attained within two years of planting.	 	 	 

	All landscaped public or common areas and front yard landscaping within a development have automatic irrigation systems or xeriscape concepts to ensure plant survival.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines L1.2.1 – L1.2.10 for design guidelines that help meet the “General Landscape Design” criterion)	 	 	 

	L2: Yard Landscape Design

	Front yard landscaping reinforces other design elements of the home through the use of vines on trellises, hedges, or low fences or walls.	 	 	 

	Fences and hedges are not placed near neighborhood streets, access lanes, or alleyways in such a way to create a safety or entering sight distance concern and they complement building and site design.	 	 	 

	Front Yard Decorative Fences: Front yard fences are decorative and help to define semi-private areas in the front of the building or between the building and a common open space area. 	 	 	 

	a.	The maximum height is 3 feet except that decorative posts and gates may have a maximum height of 4 feet.	 	 	 

	b.	Front yard decorative fences are located at least 1 foot from sidewalks and walkways to allow for planting between edge of sidewalk and fence.	 	 	 

	c.	Front yard decorative fences provide a balance of solid surfaces and voids, such as picket or open rail fence styles.	 	 	 

	d.	Front yard decorative fences are constructed of wood, simulated wood, iron, masonry, or steel picket or comparable. Solid privacy fences, vinyl fences and chain link are prohibited.	 	 	 

	Hedges:	 	 	 	 

	a.	The maximum height of a hedge in a front yard, corner side yard, or area between the building and a common open space area is 3 feet. 	 	 	 

	b.	The maximum height of hedges in interior and rear yards of multifamily developments is 6 feet, except when located abutting a common open space area the maximum may be 3 feet. 	 	 	 

	c.	The maximum height of hedges in rear yards of small lot developments is 6 feet, except when located abutting a common open space area the maximum may be 3 feet. Hedges are not allowed in interior side yards in small lot developments.	 	 	 

	Privacy Fencing: Privacy fencing is permitted in rear yards and is in character with the building’s architecture. 	 	 	 

	a.	The maximum height of privacy fencing is 6 feet, provided that portions above 4 feet are visually permeable through the use of open rails, ironwork, trellis or other treatment to encourage interaction between neighbors. 	 	 	 

	b.	Privacy fencing adjacent to a public space is set back a minimum of 1 foot from the property line.	 	 	 

	c.	Planting is provided along fences that face a street or public spaces.	 	 	 

	d.	If privacy fencing is located along an alleyway, a gate is provided for access to the alleyway.	 	 	 

	e.	Privacy fencing is constructed of wood, simulated wood, iron, masonry, or steel picket or comparable. Vinyl or chain link fencing is not permitted.	 	 	 

	Walls, hedges, and fences used to define outdoor private spaces that are not located within a required yard are a maximum of 6 feet. Portions above 4 feet in height are visually permeable through the use of open rails, ironwork, trellis or other treatment to encourage interaction among neighbors.	 	 	 

	At least one tree having a minimum caliper size of 2 inches or height of 8 feet is planted in the front yard of each small lot development home that has a front yard setback of 15 feet or greater unless this would conflict with an approved street tree planting plan.	 	 	 

	Shrubs:	 	 	 

	a.	A continuous row of shrubs is planted adjacent to that portion of a foundation facing a public space. Spacing reflects the varying growth habits of the selected species and ensures effective screening of the foundation. The use of a mix of species and varieties within a foundation planting area is encouraged.	 	 	 

	b.	Shrubs have an average size of 2-gallon for native plants and 3-gallon for non-native.	 	 	 

	Entry walks have a minimum width of 3 feet.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines L2.2.1 – L2.2.4 for design guidelines that help meet the “Yard Landscape Design” criterion)	 	 	 

	L3: Parking Area Landscaping

	All parking areas provide interior landscaping for shade purposes and aesthetic enhancement.	 	 	 

	Curbed planter areas are provided at the end of each parking aisle to protect parked vehicles from the turning movements of other vehicles.	 	 	 

	Parking lots are landscaped with broad branching shade trees at a minimum ratio of 3 trees per 10 parking spaces for single-loaded stalls, 6 trees per 20 parking spaces for double-loaded stalls and one tree for every 3 parking spaces for smaller parking bays.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines L3.2.1 – L3.2.6 for design guidelines that help meet the “Parking Area Landscaping” criterion)	 	 	 

	L4: Landscaping and Planting Requirements

	Planting Calculation and Installation:

If the calculation of the number of plantings results in a fraction of 0.5 or greater, the fraction is rounded up to the next whole number. If the calculation of the number of plantings results in a fraction of less than 0.5, the fraction is rounded down to the previous whole number. Existing trees may be used to meet the tree requirements in the planting calculations. 	 	 	 

	Parks:	 	 	 	 

	a.	One 2-inch caliper or 8-foot tall canopy or ornamental tree is planted for every 2,000 square feet of park area. 	 	 	 

	b.	Shade trees are provided adjacent to play structures and at other elements in the park, such as sport courts and benches.	 	 	 

	c.	A pathway, with a minimum width of 3 feet, connects parks to neighborhood streets, access lanes or other pedestrian connections.	 	 	 

	Common Greens and Pocket Park:	 	 	 

	a.	One 2-inch caliper or 8-foot tall canopy or ornamental tree is planted for every 1,000 square feet of common green or pocket park area.	 	 	 

	b.	The common greens and pocket parks are planted with plants that reflect the character and the intended use of the greens.	 	 	 

	c. 	A pathway, with a minimum width of 3 feet, connects common greens or pocket parks to neighborhood streets, access lanes or other pedestrian routes.	 	 	 

	Pedestrian Easements:

Trees are required along all pedestrian easements to provide shade.	 	 	 

	a.	Trees have a minimum caliper of 2 inches at time of planting unless the City determines that a particular species or cultivar, which is available only in a smaller size, is the preferred selection for a specific location.	 	 	 

	b.	Trees are spaced 20 to 30 feet on center, depending on the form and spacing requirements for the selected trees. 	 	 	 

	c.	Trees are placed so as not to block sight distance or create a safety concern.	 	 	 

	d.	Generally, tree species are selected from the City’s Approved Street Tree Palette (UPMC 13.20.1060), which is contained in the City’s Streetscape Design Standards and Guidelines adopted pursuant to this chapter. The City may approve trees not on the Approved Street Tree Palette (UPMC 13.20.1060) provided a registered landscape architect or certified arborist demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the proposed tree species will not cause damage to infrastructure or create nuisance conditions. 	 	 	 

	Shrubs are planted within a minimum 15 percent of easement space.	 	 	 

	a.	Shrubs are spaced to reflect the varying growth habits of the selected species.	 	 	 

	b.	Shrubs have an average size of 2-gallon for native plants and 3-gallon for non-native.	 	 	 

	Groundcover or perennials must fully cover the remaining landscape area. Plantings are designed to achieve a minimum planting area coverage of 90 percent of required coverage within 3 years of installation.	 	 	 

	(Refer to Design Guidelines within L4.1 – L4.4 for design guidelines that help meet the “Landscaping and Planting Requirements” criterion)

19.55.010 Purpose.

The purpose of overlay zones is to establish special standards for certain areas of the City characterized by unique historical development patterns or which may require special standards due to other unique circumstances applicable to the properties and to implement the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan regarding economic development and protection of residential neighborhoods.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.55.020 Transition properties overlay zone standards.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the transition properties overlay zone standards is to provide extra protection for selected residential neighborhoods that abut or are across the street from commercial development.

B. Future development or redevelopment of nonsingle-family uses (attached or detached) of properties designated as transition properties shall be subject to the following standards:

1. There shall be a 25-foot minimum setback from all local streets;

2. Level I landscaping is required within the front yard setback abutting all local streets as defined in Chapter 13.20 UPMC, Article II, and in rear yard setbacks abutting R1 property. A landscape easement of the same width on abutting property may be used to satisfy this requirement;

3. Vehicle access shall not be permitted onto local streets unless provided specifically by ordinance;

4. A solid 100 percent sight-obscuring six-foot-high fence or wall shall be located within or along the required setback along all local streets. The location of the fence or wall shall be approved by the Director. For the purposes of this section, a cyclone fence with slats is not a sight-obscuring fence;

5. On-site lighting shall be shielded or directed away from abutting or adjacent residential uses;

6. Whenever a commercial building abuts the landscape requirement, or when the lower story of a commercial building is used for nonresidential purposes, only high (those that do not provide easy viewing) windows may be used on the side of the building abutting a residential use. This does not apply to residential uses.

(Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 423 § 70, 2004; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.55.030 Day Island/Day Island South Spit overlay zones.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the Day Island/Day Island South Spit overlay zones is to preserve the unique residential character of Day Island and support continued marina operations at the north end of Day Island by allowing flexibility in building setbacks and other development standards.

B. Day Island Development Standards.

1. Unless otherwise specified in this section, all development standards of this code and UPMC Title 18, where applicable, also apply.

2. For the purpose of the Day Island development standards, Day Island is divided into two areas, Day Island and the South Spit. Day Island is generally that portion north of the 27th Street Bridge, and the South Spit generally that portion south of the 27th Street Bridge. Specific lots subject to the development standards are identified in Figure 1.

19.65.060 Definitions.

“At risk tree” is any tree with a structural defect and/or disease which makes it subject to a high probability of failure and with a proximity to persons or property that makes it an imminent threat.

“Brushing” means the practice of removing significant groundcover by hand or hand-operated equipment to create better visibility on a property for purposes such as marketing or surveying of said property.

“Christmas tree” means any evergreen tree or the top thereof, commonly known as a Christmas tree, with limbs and branches, with or without roots, including fir, pine, spruce, cedar and other coniferous species.

“Clearing” means the cutting, moving on site, or removal of standing or fallen timber (including stumps); the removal or moving on site of stumps; or the cutting or removal of brush, grass, groundcover, or other vegetative matter from a site in a way which exposes the earth’s surface of the site.

“Conversion” means converting the use of land from forestry to nonforestry uses.

“Critical root zone” is an area where the tree’s roots are located. This root zone is generally the area surrounding a tree at a distance which is equal to one-foot radius for every diameter-inch measured at breast height (dbh) or four and one-half feet above ground.

“Crown” is the area of a tree containing leaf- or needle-bearing branches.

“Development” is the division of a parcel of land into two or more parcels; the construction, reconstruction, conversion, structural alteration, relocation, or enlargements of any structure; any mining, excavation, landfill, stockpiling, clearing or land disturbance; and any use or extension of use of the land.

“Diameter at breast height” (dbh) is a tree’s diameter in inches at four and one-half feet above the ground. On multi-stemmed or multi-trunked trees, the diameter shall be the diameter equivalent to the sum of trunk areas measured at four and one-half feet above ground.

“Drip line” of a tree means an imaginary line on the ground created by the vertical projection of the foliage at its greatest circumference.

“Forest practices” means any activity relating to growing trees and harvesting or processing timber including but not limited to road and trail construction; harvesting; thinning; reforestation, fertilization, prevention and suppression of diseases and insects; salvage of trees; and brush control.

“Groundcover” means types of vegetation which are normally terrestrial such as shrubs, vines, grasses, and herbaceous plants.

“Invasive tree” is a species that was introduced by humans to locations outside of their native range that spread and persist over large areas. Invasive species negatively impact natural ecosystems by displacing native species, reducing biological diversity, and interfering with natural succession. Tree species known to be invasive in the Pacific Northwest are listed in UPMC 19.65.340. 

“Limited tree removal” is the removal of five trees or less in any 36 consecutive months for the purposes of property development, solar access, general property and utility maintenance, landscaping or gardening.

“Nuisance tree” is a species that is known to be weak-wooded and unstable, or one that exhibits other traits that render it prone to creating nuisance conditions for persons and property located in close proximity to such trees. Tree species categorized as nuisance trees in University Place are listed in UPMC 19.65.350.

“Outdoor storage area” means an area on a site where materials, merchandise and/or equipment is stored outdoors.

“Remove” or “removal” is the act of removing a tree by digging up, cutting down, or any act which causes the tree to die within a period of three years, including, but not limited to, damage inflicted on the root system by machinery, storage of materials, or soil compacting, or changing the ground level in the area of the tree’s root system; damage inflicted on the tree permitting infections or infestation; excessive pruning; topping; paving with concrete, asphalt, or other impervious material within the drip line; or any other action which is deemed harmful to the tree.

“Replacement tree” means any self-supporting perennial woody plant that measures at least six feet in height at the time of planting and at 24 inches above the root ball has a diameter of at least three inches for evergreen trees, and is fully branched and has a minimum caliper of two inches and a minimum height of 10 feet at time of planting for deciduous trees.

“Significant tree” means a tree identified on the City’s inventory of significant trees.

“Tree” means a living woody plant characterized by one or more main stems or trunks and many branches, with the trunk or at least one main stem having a diameter of six inches or more at breast height (dbh). Invasive, nuisance or hazard trees, of any size, as determined by the City, are not considered trees for the purposes of this chapter.

“Tree removal permit” means a permit issued by the City to permit clearing and/or tree removal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

“Tree topping” is an extreme form of crown reduction that removes whole tops of trees or large branches and/or trunks from the tops of trees, leaving stubs or lateral branches that are too small to assume the role of a terminal leader – the vertical stem at the top of the trunk. Tree topping severely cuts back large trees to a predetermined size in a manner that:

1. Leaves large exposed wounds that can become infested; 

2. Ruins tree structure; 

3. Removes too much foliage, disrupting the tree’s energy storage; 

4. Stimulates vigorous new growth, which is prone to breakage; 

5. Increases tree maintenance costs; and 

6. Destroys a tree’s appearance and value. 

“Understory” means small trees and shrubs growing below the canopy of larger trees.

“Urban forest management” means the management of trees in the City, whether on public or private property, for the purposes of but not limited to maintaining the wooded character of the City and property values; providing wildlife habitat, buffering, and wind protection; facilitating aquifer recharge and slope stabilization and enhancing our healthy, safe, and attractive environment.

“Urban forester” is a licensed professional approved by the City with academic and/or field experience that makes him or her a recognized expert in tree preservation and management. For City approval, an urban forester shall be a Society of American Foresters (SAF) Certified Forester, an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) Certified Arborist, or an American Society of Consulting Arborists (ASCA) Registered Consulting Arborist.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 514 § 5, 2008; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003).


19.65.070 Exemptions.

The following shall be exempt from the tree removal permit requirements of this chapter but shall satisfy all standards and requirements of UPMC 19.65.240 and other sections as noted below. Except for limited tree removal, a written exemption must be obtained from the City prior to commencing any clearing or tree removal.

A. Limited tree removal except in the following critical areas: landslide and erosion hazard area, fish and wildlife habitat area or its buffer, and/or wetland or wetland buffer – unless authorized pursuant to UPMC Title 17, Critical Areas.

B. Removal of trees where the trunks are located within 10 feet of an existing building that will remain on a site.

C. Removal of at risk trees in emergency situations involving immediate danger to life or property or substantial fire hazards as determined by the City. Replacement of any trees removed is required in accordance with the replacement provisions of this chapter.

D. Removal of an at risk tree following an affirmative recommendation by an ISA-Certified Arborist or ASCA Registered Consulting Arborist that the tree is a safety risk and should be removed. The arborist shall conduct an assessment in accordance with ANSI A300 (Part 9) – 2011 Tree Risk Assessment and provide a written report that includes: identification and location of the specified trees; a description of the methods used; tree risk assessment data; recommendations for mitigating risk or additional assessments; and, recommendations for monitoring and follow-up. The arborist performing this work shall have a Tree Risk Assessment Qualification (TRAQ) or equivalent. The City may, at its discretion and in consideration of ISA tree risk assessment guidance, waive the certified or registered arborist requirement if City staff conducts an on-site inspection and determines that a tree clearly and obviously constitutes a risk. City staff should consider the following conditions when conducting a tree risk assessment:

1. Is the tree dead, diseased, decayed, burned or otherwise damaged;

2. Are there multiple weak branch attachments, broken and/or hanging limbs;

3. Is the foliage sparse, and/or discolored;

4. Is there evidence of root rot/exposed, undermined or pruned roots or a restricted root area;

5. If leaning, what is the degree of lean? Are roots broken or is the soil heaving or cracking;

6. Is the top broken on conifers; and

7. Are there targets such as buildings, parking, or traffic or pedestrian facilities below the tree? Can the target(s) be moved?

Upon such inspection, staff may determine that further review by a certified or registered arborist is required before making a determination as to whether a tree constitutes a risk. 

E. Removal of windthrow. 

F. Emergencies. Removal of trees necessary to protect public safety or public or private property from imminent danger in response to emergencies declared by the City, County, State or Federal governments. In the case of a declared emergency, the written approval requirement shall be waived.

G. Removal of street trees, when performed by or on behalf of the City to maintain rights-of-way and in the interest of public safety.

H. Removal of trees that interfere with existing utility transmission lines when pruning is not sufficient to alleviate the interference condition. Topping is prohibited. Utility pruning shall be conducted in accordance with the latest edition of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Publication NA-FR-01-95 How to Prune Trees available on the web, except that tree pruning for utilities shall be conducted in accordance with the latest edition of the International Society of Arboriculture’s Best Management Practices – Utility Pruning of Trees.

19.65.080 Required water conservation.

During periods when water conservation is required, new landscaping and maintenance of existing required landscaping shall not be required. However, following the lifting of water restrictions, any landscaping required during the period of the required conservation shall be installed and all required landscaping shall be restored to a healthy condition. Any required landscaping that has died shall be replaced in accordance with UPMC 19.65.220.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.090 Landscaping.

Landscaping shall be located along street frontages, around the perimeter, in parking areas and/or on other areas of a site in accordance with the following sections and the landscape tables in UPMC 19.65.150(A) and (B). This subsection shall apply to the following:

A. New Development. All new uses shall provide landscaping in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The landscape tables indicate the particular landscape category which applies to proposed uses. The tables and other sections of this chapter shall be used as standards when landscaping requirements are imposed as part of a discretionary permit review process.

B. Expansions of or Alterations to Existing Uses. The requirements of this section shall apply to remodeling or expansion of existing uses under either of the following conditions: (1) when the remodeling or expansion results in the remodeling of or addition of 10 percent or more of the gross floor area of the existing principal building or, collectively, to any principal buildings in a development project; or (2) when the remodeling or expansion results in cumulative improvements to the interior and/or exterior of a structure (except for normal maintenance, repair, and life/safety improvements including but not limited to reroofing, painting, recarpeting, fire sprinkler installation, and improved exiting and accessibility), which within a 12-month period exceeds a cumulative value of 10 percent of the assessed value of the structure as assessed by the Pierce County Assessor’s Office. All landscape requirements of this section shall apply to the entire property. The landscape tables indicate the particular landscape category which applies to proposed expansion or alteration. Where conformance with this section would create a nonconformity of parking standards or would conflict with the location of existing buildings on the lot, the Director shall determine how the code is to be applied. The Director shall use landscape averaging by requiring more landscaping in one area and reducing it in another. In determining how to apply the landscaping requirements in such circumstances, the Director shall use the following criteria in deciding which of the landscaping requirements to adjust, listed in the order of highest importance:

1. Compliance with street frontage landscaping standards;

2. Compliance with perimeter landscaping standards;

3. Compliance with internal area of parking lot standards;

4. Compliance with other landscaping standards of this title.

C. Change of Use or Occupancy. When the use of a building or lot changes to another use which does not involve expansion or remodeling as provided in subsection (B) of this section, such use need not provide additional landscaping except under the following circumstances:

1. Additional off-street parking is required, in which case the landscaping required by UPMC 19.65.110 shall be required for all new parking spaces or parking facilities provided.

2. The use is subject to special use permit in which case the review authority shall establish the minimum landscape requirements for the specific use.

3. New uses, storage or other activities will take place outdoors, in which case the requirements of UPMC 19.65.120 shall apply.

4. The previous use did not comply with the requirements of the landscaping regulations in effect at the time it was established.

5. Difference of Standards. Where there is a difference in the standards listed in this section and the specific requirements listed for specific uses, the more stringent will apply. The Director may permit alternative landscaping, as provided in UPMC 19.65.170, when the overall site development plan proposed provides equivalent or better results than required by this title.

6. If contiguous lots are developed jointly, the requirement for perimeter buffering between the jointly developed lots shall not be required.

7. No street frontage landscaping is required for single-family or duplex dwellings constructed on a lot of record that existed on the effective date of this code.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 662 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 452 § 1 (Exh. B), 2005; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.095 Difference of standards.

Where there is a difference between the standards listed in this chapter and the specific requirements listed for specific uses, the more stringent will apply. Landscaping design standards and guidelines specified for small lot development, multifamily development, and projects located within the TC, MU, MU-O, MU-M or CC zones shall prevail when conflicts between this chapter and these specific requirements exist. The Director may permit alternative landscaping, as provided in UPMC 19.65.170, when the overall site development plan proposed provides equivalent or better results than required by this title.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 662 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.65.100 Street frontage landscaping.

Any portion of any use, except individual single-family or duplex lots that abut a public right-of-way, shall install Level III landscaping unless otherwise specified. See Figure 3 in UPMC 19.65.140.

19.65.105 Transition landscaping requirements.

Development or redevelopment of uses not permitted in the R1 or R2 zones on those portions of properties that abut or are across a local street (as defined in Chapter 13.20 UPMC) from an R1 or R2 zoned property shall:

A. Install Level I landscaping within the front yard setback abutting all local streets. See Figure 1 in UPMC 19.65.140.

B. Install a solid 100 percent sight-obscuring six-foot-high fence or wall within or along the required setback along all local streets. The location of the fence or wall shall be approved by the Director. For the purposes of this section, a cyclone fence with slats is not a sight-obscuring fence.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 662 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 452 § 1 (Exh. B), 2005).


19.65.110 Parking lot and impervious surface area landscaping.

A. The intent of this section is to break up and reduce the barren appearance of parking, circulation, loading, storage and other large impervious surface areas of a site. To the extent practicable, landscaped areas shall be dispersed throughout the impervious surface area.

B. Perimeter Street Landscaping. Any portion of a parking lot, outdoor sales area or other large impervious surface area that is within 20 feet of a public road right-of-way shall install Level III landscaping along that portion of the parking lot perimeter. See Figure 3 in UPMC 19.65.140.

C. Interior Landscaping. All surface parking lots with 10 or more spaces or combined outdoor sales areas greater than 1,600 square feet must provide interior landscaping as follows:

1. Row Requirement. The maximum number of consecutive vehicle parking or sales display spaces without an intervening island or peninsula is 10, unless the row fronts on a landscaping area with a minimum planting width of eight feet. For such rows, the maximum consecutive parking spaces without an intervening island or peninsula is 20 spaces. A landscaping island or peninsula is required at the end of each row of four or more automobile parking spaces that terminates within a parking or circulation area.

2. Island/Peninsula Requirement. Landscape islands and peninsulas shall have a minimum planting width and length of eight feet and minimum planting area of 120 square feet. There shall be at least one tree planted on every island and peninsula.

3. Planting Type and Density. The following landscaping is the minimum required for each 300 square feet of impervious surface landscaping: one two-inch caliper deciduous tree or one six-foot-tall evergreen tree; five five-gallon shrubs; and groundcover. There shall be a minimum of one deciduous canopy tree per four parking spaces or vehicle storage or sales display spaces. Deciduous canopy trees shall be selected in accordance with the Approved Street Tree Palette (UPMC 13.20.1060) provided in the streetscape standards adopted pursuant to Chapter 13.20 UPMC, Article IX.

4. Curb/Curb Edge. Planting areas shall be fully protected by curbs as a means of preventing injury to plants from pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to prevent landscaping material from entering the storm drainage system. No trees or shrubs shall be planted within two feet of a curb edge. Groundcover is required within this two-foot area.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.120 Perimeter landscape buffering.

A. Intent. The intent of this section is to provide for a physical, visual and noise buffer and transition between uses. Different landscape/buffer levels are used to address different uses, compatibility and in conjunction with new subdivisions.

B. General Requirements. Refer to the tables in UPMC 19.65.150(A) and (B) for the landscape level required by the proposed use, expansion or alteration. Each lot line will have a required landscape level based on the abutting land use except that, when two or more properties abut and share a common driveway or parking area, perimeter landscaping along the shared property line may be waived. Pedestrian walkways shall be permitted to cross required landscape areas. Refer to Figures 1, 2, and 3 in UPMC 19.65.140 for illustration of perimeter landscaping requirements.

C. If contiguous lots are developed jointly, the requirement for perimeter buffering between the jointly developed lots shall not apply.

D. Maintenance. Where landscaping has been required or a natural buffer has been set aside, no other use including, but not limited to, the construction of structures is allowed unless authorized by the original permit.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.125 Residential development canopy tree requirement.

A minimum of one deciduous tree per 3,000 square feet of lot area shall be planted on each new single-family or duplex lot created through the short plat or conventional preliminary plat/final plat process after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. In addition, a minimum of one deciduous or evergreen tree per 2,000 square feet of dedicated common open space shall be planted within a project’s open space area. If the calculation of the number of trees results in a fraction of one-half or greater, the fraction and the number of trees shall round up to the next whole number. If this calculation results in a fraction of less than one-half, the fraction and the number of trees shall round down to the previous whole number.

Planting on an individual lot shall occur prior to the building permit being finaled for a new dwelling unit on the lot. Trees required under this provision shall be in addition to any street trees required to be planted within a public street right-of-way or replacement trees required to be planted in accordance with UPMC 19.65.310. This section shall not apply to small lot developments designed in accordance with Chapter 19.53 UPMC.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 9 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.65.130 Interior landscaping/site stabilization.

All interior portions of lots, parcels or tracts which are not developed with buildings, parking areas and/or accessory uses or where other more specific landscaping regulations are required shall be landscaped with Level IV landscaping, unless native vegetation already exists, and shall be maintained. This includes temporary stabilization of development sites.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.140 Landscape levels.

A. Level I: Visual Screen. Level I landscaping is intended to provide a very dense sight barrier to significantly separate uses and zoning districts. It shall generally consist of a mix of predominantly evergreen plantings including living trees, shrubs and groundcovers. The choice and spacing of plantings shall be such that they will form a dense hedge sufficient to obscure sight through the screen within three years after planting. Where a sight-obscuring fence is required, chain-link fencing with slats shall not be considered to be sight-obscuring. Level I landscaping shall consist of the following:

1. A minimum of two staggered rows of evergreen trees planted along the entire length of the required buffer. Trees shall be chosen and spaced so as to form an effective visual screen, which creates a solid sight-obscuring barrier within three years of planting. Evergreen trees shall be planted no greater than 15 feet on center in each row.

2. The width of a Level I landscape buffer shall be no less than 20 feet. The area which is not planted with trees shall be planted with shrubs and groundcover. Shrubs shall be spaced no greater than five feet on center. Shrubs and groundcover shall be planted to attain a coverage of 90 percent of the planting area within three years.

3. Lawns may be used to cover up to 75 percent of the landscape area which is not planted with trees or shrubs.

Figure 1. Landscaping Level I, Visual Screen

C. Level III: Ornamental Effects Landscaping. Level III landscaping is intended to provide a visual separation of uses from streets; and visual separation of compatible uses so as to soften the appearance of the development from public streets and soften the appearance of parking areas, buildings, and other improvements. Level III landscaping shall consist of:

1. Canopy-type deciduous trees or spreading evergreen trees planted in clumps or strips with a mix of living evergreen and deciduous groundcovers and low shrubs. Up to 100 percent of the trees may be deciduous. Trees shall be spaced at intervals no greater than 30 feet on center.

2. The width of a Level III landscape buffer shall be no less than five feet. The area which is not planted with trees shall be planted with shrubs and living groundcover chosen and planted to attain a coverage of 90 percent within three years of planting. Shrubs shall be planted at a density of five shrubs per 100 square feet of that portion of the landscape area which is not planted in lawn. Lawn may be used for up to 75 percent of the required groundcover.

3. Landscaping located within public rights-of-way shall be approved by the Department, prior to planting, as part of the review of landscape plans required by UPMC 19.65.200. Landscaping in the public right-of-way shall be in accordance with Chapter 13.20, Article IX, Design Standards and Guidelines for Streetscape Elements.

D. Level IV: Soil Stabilizing Vegetation/Landscaping. Level IV landscaping is intended to provide soil stability, prevent erosion and prevent sedimentation of off-site properties and improvements. Level IV landscaping shall consist of lawn, other living groundcover, shrubs and trees with a root structure which stabilizes soil where necessary to prevent erosion and sedimentation. Type IV landscaping may include other organic and/or inorganic soil-stabilizing materials such as rockeries, retaining walls or other similar slope and soil stabilization devices. Level IV landscaping shall be established on all portions of development sites that are or have remained undeveloped for a period of six months.

19.65.160 Not required in wetlands or across streams.

The landscape requirements of this chapter are not required in a wetland, wetland buffer, fish and wildlife buffers or across streams.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.170 Modification of landscaping requirements.

A. Upon written request supported by one or more of the following instances the Director may authorize a reduced width of planting or waive some or all of the landscaping requirements:

1. Where, except those areas where Level IV landscaping is required, the requirement of this chapter would require more than 50 percent of the site area (excluding parking lots) to be landscaped, the Director may modify the requirements so that not more than 50 percent of the site area (excluding parking lots) must be landscaped. The Director may require more intensive landscaping if the reduction in the required planting area would reduce the effectiveness of the landscaping to a point where the intent of the landscape level cannot be satisfied.

2. When the inclusion of existing vegetation on the site would result in landscaping equivalent to or better than the requirements of this chapter in achieving the intent of the required landscape level.

3. When existing conditions on or abutting the site, including, but not limited to, differences in elevation, existing vegetation, location of buildings or utilities would render the requirements of this chapter ineffective.

4. When Level I visual screening is required, an applicant may request to use plantings that can be expected to form a healthy sight-obscuring evergreen hedge of equivalent screening within three years in lieu of two rows of trees. In reviewing such a request for modification, the Director shall consider the applicant’s request in light of the intent of Level I landscaping and the nature of the use or development which is being screened.

5. When the applicant proposes an alternative method of landscaping that would achieve the intent and purpose of the landscaping required in this chapter and which the Director determines to provide superior quality through the use of native vegetation existing on site, preservation of groves of trees, preservation of wetlands and/or wildlife habitat, increasing perimeter landscape width in strategic locations, providing unique focal points of interest, or through other means.

6. When development will occur in phases and development of subsequent phases will result in removal of landscaping required by this title.

B. When approving a request for a modification of landscaping requirements, the Director shall issue findings upon which the approval is based. The Director may attach conditions to any such approval of a request for modification of landscaping requirements if necessary to assure that the intent of the landscape level and any modification thereof is maintained.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.180 Planter boxes.

In limited circumstances the director may approve the use of planter boxes in lieu of Level III landscaping where such planter boxes will not obstruct sight distance. 

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.190 Sizes and types of landscaping.

Landscape areas required pursuant to UPMC 19.65.090 through 19.65.150 shall conform to the following standards. All plant material shall meet or exceed ANSI Z60.1-1996 American Standards for Nursery Stock.

A. Trees, Evergreen. Size: Coniferous and broadleaf evergreen trees may be comprised of a mixture of sizes but shall not be less than six feet in height at time of planting. Tree material at time of planting shall be of a sufficient size to meet applicable landscape buffer or screening requirements within 10 years of installation.

B. Trees, Deciduous. Size: Deciduous trees may be comprised of a mixture of sizes but shall be fully branched, have a minimum caliper of two inches and a minimum height of 10 feet at time of planting unless the City determines that a particular species or cultivar, which is available only in a smaller size, is the preferred selection for a specific location. Tree material at time of planting shall be of a sufficient size to meet any applicable landscape buffer or screening requirements within 10 years of installation.

C. Shrubs and Hedges. Size: Shrubs may be comprised of a mixture of sizes but shall not be less than 24 inches at time of planting. Shrub and hedge material at time of planting shall be of a sufficient size to meet the minimum height and screening requirements within three years of installation.

D. Groundcover, Vegetative. Size: Groundcover shall be planted to achieve a minimum planting area coverage of 90 percent of required coverage within three years of installation and shall achieve 100 percent of required coverage within five years of installation.

E. Groundcover, Inert. Wood chips, bark, decorative rock or other appropriate inert organic material may be used.

F. Lawn Sodded and Seeded. Newly seeded lawns or installed sod shall be comprised of drought-resistant and hardy varieties which, when properly installed and maintained, are capable of surviving under conditions of restricted water use.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.200 Landscape plans.

A. A Landscape plan includes a planting plan and an irrigation plan and is required to be prepared for any landscape areas required in UPMC 19.65.100 through 19.65.130 including active recreation areas in formal subdivisions and short subdivisions. Other areas require only a planting plan. Plans shall be submitted to the Department for review and approval.

B. Landscape plans shall be prepared by a Washington State registered landscape architect, a Washington State certified nurseryperson, or a Washington State certified landscaper, except that landscape plans for short subdivisions and for street tree requirements may be prepared by the applicant. A certified irrigation designer shall prepare the irrigation plan.

C. A planting plan is required to ensure that the proposed plantings are in conformance with the standards and requirements of this chapter. A planting plan drawn to the same scale as the other development plans shall include, at a minimum, the following components:

1. The location of existing vegetation to be retained, proposed vegetation, property lines, impervious surfaces, existing or proposed buildings, natural or manmade water features or bodies, existing or proposed fences and retaining walls, critical lands and associated buffers, and designated recreational open space areas.

2. A plant schedule containing the botanical and common names of the new plant material, existing plant material proposed to be retained, the planting size of the material, the number of each plant, and any special planting instructions.

3. Whenever possible the landscape plan shall incorporate the recommendations contained in the City’s publication on root control, water conservation and suggested plant material.

D. An irrigation plan is required to ensure that the planting will be watered at a sufficient level to ensure plant survival and healthy growth. All landscaped areas must provide an irrigation method as stated below:

1. Option 1. A permanent underground irrigation method with an automatic controller plus an overriding rain switch.

2. Option 2. An irrigation method which provides sufficient water to ensure that the plants will become established. The method shall be required to be permanent unless the plant materials selected are determined to be drought-tolerant by the Department, in which case irrigation standards shall be required only during the initial three growing seasons following installation. Even if drought-tolerant plants are used in the landscape design, there must be an identified method to easily provide water to the plants in the case of a prolonged drought. Any automatic/mechanical system designed under this option shall be fitted with an overriding rain switch.

E. Planting is encouraged to take place in the spring or fall planting season following final development permit approval, and shall be completed prior to final occupancy approval of the building. The Director may allow a postponement of the landscaping due to weather conditions, with appropriate financial guarantees to ensure completion, but in no case shall planting be postponed beyond 90 days after the certificate of occupancy is issued or final inspection. However, the Director may approve an alternative timeline associated with a phased project.

F. Following installation of the landscaping and irrigation, the person or persons who prepared the planting and irrigation plans shall submit, within 30 days, a signed affidavit that the landscaping and irrigation system has been installed per the approved plans. The City will conduct an inspection prior to final approval of the landscape plan.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.210 Maintenance.

A. The following standards shall be followed for all required landscaping:

1. The property owner shall maintain all landscaping for the life of the land use. Any plantings removed should be replaced with plantings of like kind or ones that achieve the original objectives of the approved landscape plan.

2. All landscape materials shall be pruned and trimmed as necessary to maintain a healthy growing condition or to prevent primary limb failure. Tree pruning shall be accomplished in accordance with the latest edition of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Publication NA-FR-01-95 How to Prune Trees available on the web.

3. All landscape areas shall be kept free of trash.

B. Uses permitted by special use permits issued before the City’s incorporation where landscaping was required as a condition of approval shall be subject to the maintenance provisions of this section.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.220 Replacement.

The following standards apply to the replacement of vegetation within required landscape areas:

A. Any installed plant material located within required landscape areas which dies shall be replaced during the spring or fall growing season following plant loss but not greater than 180 days from time of loss. This standard applies for the life of the project.

B. Any tree existing on site at the time of development, greater than four inches dbh, located within a required perimeter landscape buffer or parking lot landscape areas, shall be replaced during the spring or fall growing season following death or following a determination by an urban forester or the City that the tree is diseased or damaged and has a significant chance of toppling in high winds, but not greater than 180 days from time of loss. The existing tree shall be replaced on a two-for-one basis. Any future replacement of the initial replacement trees shall occur at a one-for-one ratio. This standard applies for the life of the project.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.230 Financial guaranty.

A. Performance bonds or other appropriate security (including but not limited to an assignment of funds) in the amount of 125 percent of the approved estimated landscaping cost shall be required if landscaping is not installed. The financial guaranty shall be provided prior to issuance of occupancy, for nonresidential building permits, before final inspection of residential construction, and prior to final subdivision or short plat approval, whichever is applicable. Prior to accepting a financial guaranty, the City shall have approved the landscape plans and a cost estimate for completing the landscaping. The cost estimate shall include the cost of plant material, irrigation and labor, installation, and materials.

B. For all projects which require landscaping except short plats, a 36-month landscaping maintenance guaranty equal to the cost of the landscaping less the irrigation system shall be required prior to final project approval or release of the landscape performance bond. At the end of the 36-month period, the applicant shall request that the City inspect the landscaping to ensure all planted material is alive and healthy. Any plant material needing replacement shall be replaced in accordance with UPMC 19.65.220 and inspected prior to the release of the maintenance guaranty. After the maintenance bond is released, landscaping shall be maintained in accordance with UPMC 19.65.210. The director may extend the maintenance guarantee beyond the initial 36-month term if necessary to ensure establishment of any plants replaced during the initial term. In recognition that landscape maintenance bonds may not always be readily obtainable, options for guarantees could be provided, as shown in subsection (C) of this section. 

C. The landscape maintenance guarantee may take the form of: (1) a maintenance bond in a form deemed acceptable to the City; (2) an assignment of funds in an amount equal to the bonded amount (125 percent of the cost of landscaping less the irrigation system); or (3) a three-year contractual agreement between the owner/developer and a licensed landscape architect, Washington certified nurseryman, or Washington certified landscape contractor, along with a rider or endorsement specifically identifying the City as a party to the agreement for purposes of enforcement.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.240 Urban forest management.

The intent of this section is best stated in Comprehensive Plan policy EN3I, which states, “Protect and enhance the natural green and wooded character of University Place.” Therefore, projects shall be designed around existing trees, preserving the maximum number of trees and existing native vegetation as possible. The intent is to discourage clear-cutting of a project site, mass grading and reliance on replanting with smaller trees as mitigation for the loss of tree canopy. Forest practices except for Christmas tree cultivation are prohibited in University Place. Because of the likelihood that much of the remaining undeveloped privately owned land within the City will be converted to urban development in the foreseeable future, all trees shall be managed in accordance with this chapter.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.250 City tree account.

Funds kept for planting and maintenance of trees on City property and in public rights-of-way shall be kept in a City tree account. Funds shall be placed in the account by the City Council, from fines collected as a result of violations of this chapter, from payments in lieu of replacement trees, from private donations and from grants and loans for the purpose of establishing and maintaining trees in the City. A schedule of tree costs including tree purchase, installation and maintenance is adopted by separate resolution.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.260 Significant trees.

The City may maintain an inventory of significant trees.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.270 Tree retention in development situations.

A. This section regulates the removal of trees associated with the development process to encourage development, where practicable, to incorporate existing trees, particularly high quality or more desirable trees, into a design. It is the intent of these provisions to lessen the aesthetic and ecological impacts of tree removal.

B. The applicant must show how existing trees, excluding invasive trees, nuisance trees and at risk trees, will be preserved by choosing one of the following options to identify those trees to be retained. Trees located within a critical area or associated buffer are excluded from the following calculations:

1. Preserve at least 35 percent of the trees located on the site;

2. Preserve all trees greater than or equal to 20 inches dbh and at least 20 percent of the total tree diameter on the site, where there are at least four trees greater than or equal to 20 inches dbh on the site;

3. Preserve at least 50 percent of all trees greater than or equal to 20 inches dbh and at least 25 percent of the total tree diameter on the site, where there are at least four trees greater than or equal to 20 inches dbh on the site;

4. Preserve at least 30 percent of the total tree diameter on the site, where all trees are less than 20 inches dbh; or

5. Preserve at least 35 percent of the total regulated tree canopy area on the site, if the site is larger than two acres. 

C. In addition to those trees identified for retention in subsection (B) of this section, the following trees shall be retained:

1. All trees within a critical area including wetlands or wetland buffers, fish and wildlife habitat buffers, or landslide and erosion hazard areas with slopes requiring preservation, unless removal is authorized pursuant to UPMC Title 17. If the City determines that a tree located within a critical area is an at risk tree, the City may authorize conversion of the tree to a “habitat snag” by cutting the tree at the highest point possible that still eliminates risk from a tree. The lower portion of the tree remains in place as a habitat snag to provide habitat value for fish and wildlife. In addition, the upper portion of the tree is usually left on the ground to provide extra habitat value. Also, in order to compensate for the loss in habitat value, additional tree plantings in the critical area and/or buffer may be required as mitigation;

2. All trees within an identified scenic road corridor, wildlife corridor, or scenic trail identified in the City’s Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan or the Comprehensive Plan;

3. All significant trees; and

4. Trees located within a shoreline vegetation conservation area except when their removal is authorized in accordance with UPMC 18.25.100(F) and (G).

D. Except as provided in subsection (C)(1) of this section, trees to be retained shall not include at risk trees that are determined to be exempt under UPMC 19.65.070(D). At risk trees may include:

1. Damaged or diseased trees; 

2. Trees that pose a safety hazard due to potential root, trunk or primary limb failure; or 

3. Mature trees that have grown in a dense stand of trees and recently become exposed to windthrow due to nearby development activity.

E. At the discretion of the City, damaged or standing dead trees may be retained and counted toward the tree requirement, if demonstrated that such trees will provide important wildlife habitat and are not classified as at risk trees.

F. A tree removal permit is required when the development activity will result in the removal of more than five trees. Up to five trees may be removed in development situations before calculating the number of trees that shall be retained as set forth in subsection (B) of this section.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 628 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.275 Tree retention – No associated development. 

A. The purpose of this section is to manage and conserve the urban forest when development activity is neither proposed nor occurring.

B. Trees listed in UPMC 19.65.270(C) shall be retained.

C. A maximum of five trees not listed in UPMC 19.65.270(C) may be removed within a 36-month period without a tree removal permit. In addition, trees determined to be at risk trees as provided in UPMC 19.65.270(D), invasive trees as provided in UPMC 19.65.340, and nuisance trees as provided in UPMC 19.65.350 may be removed and will not count toward the five-tree limit. 

D. Removal of additional trees beyond those provided for in subsection (C) of this section may only be authorized through issuance of a tree removal permit in accordance with the tree retention standards set forth in UPMC 19.65.270 and this chapter. 

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


19.65.280 Tree retention plans.

The City shall participate in the three phases of tree retention described below. The City may retain an urban forester to work on the City’s behalf. The urban forester shall be paid by the City and the applicant shall reimburse the City for all urban forester costs. Urban forester expenses shall be reimbursed prior to the issuance of any building permits or final approval, whichever is first required following the work done by the urban forester.

A. Survey and Evaluation Phase.

1. Individual Tree Survey. The applicant shall provide a survey of the location of all trees and place them on the site plan. All trees located near existing and proposed buildings, roads, common open space areas, and other activity areas shall be evaluated. The tree identification number, species, size, condition, vigor, structure, risk of failure, and maintenance recommendations shall be documented in the plan.

2. Statistical Sampling. For large stands of trees proposed to be retained in their entirety or largely in their entirety, statistical sampling may be used to estimate the total tree dbh and total number of trees present. Sampling must be carried out by an SAF Certified Forester based on standard methodologies. Statistical sampling may be used in these stands in lieu of individual tree survey.

3. Tree Canopy. When calculating the amount of regulated tree canopy on a site, the total canopy area must be based on the most recent aerial photograph available. The aerial photograph must be no more than five years old. Other data such as LiDAR may be used to help in calculating tree canopy as appropriate. Regulated tree canopy excludes invasive trees, nuisance trees, at risk trees and trees within critical areas or their buffers.

B. Planning and Design Phase.

1. Detailed planning and design should not proceed until the survey and evaluation phase is completed so that the project design may achieve the most beneficial tree retention plan from the standpoint of maximizing ecological and aesthetic benefit to the community. The applicant shall work with the City to determine which trees can be preserved based on location, grade changes, and proposed uses and improvements.

2. The critical root zone (CRZ) of all trees to be retained near clearing, grading, or other disturbances shall be shown on all site plan construction documents. Any grading, construction, or utility installation within the CRZ shall be called out on the plan. Required work in these areas shall be under the direction or instruction of the City.

3. The locations of tree protection barriers shall be shown on the clearing and grading plans. Tree protection barriers shall be shown along the edge of the CRZ or adjusted under the direction of the City.

C. Construction Phase.

1. A preconstruction meeting is required before any clearing takes place. The City shall point out retained trees to the general contractor, review tree preservation guidelines, and answer questions regarding tree protection.

2. The City shall inspect and approve the tree protection barrier prior to any work on the site, make adjustments where necessary, and discuss techniques to work within CRZs as needed.

3. The City shall establish a schedule to periodically monitor the tree retention plan based on the number of trees and difficulty of protecting trees during construction.

4. When clearing and grading activities are completed, the applicant shall request an inspection. The City may require tree maintenance and remedial action to improve tree health and vigor. If any unauthorized trees are removed, the City shall take action in accordance with UPMC 19.65.040.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.290 Tree protection.

A. To provide the best protection for remaining trees:

1. No tree removal that requires a permit shall be allowed on a site until approval of the tree removal permit.

2. An area free of disturbance, generally corresponding to the CRZ of each tree, shall be identified on the site plan. During construction a temporary five-foot-high chain link or plastic net fence shall be installed around the trees or group of trees to be retained.

3. No impervious surfaces, fill, excavation, or storage of construction materials shall be permitted within the area enclosed by such fencing.

4. A rock wall shall be constructed if the grade level around a tree is to be raised by more than one foot. The inside diameter of the wall shall be equal to the diameter of the drip line of the tree.

5. The grade level shall not be lowered within the larger of the two areas defined as follows:

a. The drip line of the tree(s); or

b. An area around the tree equal to one-foot diameter or each inch of tree trunk diameter measured four feet above the ground.

B. The City may approve use of tree protection techniques, other than those listed above, if the trees will be protected to an equal or greater degree than by the techniques listed above. Alternative techniques shall be those recommended by an urban forester.

C. No impervious surface or fill shall be placed within the drip line of the tree unless the City determines that the long-term health of the tree will not be significantly harmed.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.300 Tree removal in subdivisions.

When subdividing property by preliminary plat, trees and groundcover shall not be removed prior to preliminary plat approval. When subdividing property by either short or preliminary plat, no clearing of trees or groundcover may take place until a tree preservation plan and site development permit have been approved by the City. Road locations must be staked prior to clearing. Prior to issuance of a building permit, a title notification shall be recorded that states:

Trees which are required to remain on this lot pursuant to the city’s tree preservation regulations (Chapter 19.65 UPMC) shall not be removed for a period of three years from the date of original purchase by individual lot owners except as provided for in UPMC 19.65.270(D) and only then following consent by the city. Regulated trees removed subsequent to this three year period shall be replaced in accordance with UPMC 19.65.190 and UPMC 19.65.310.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.310 Tree replacement.

A. When the required number of trees cannot be retained as determined at the sole discretion of the City, trees that are removed shall be replaced with new trees of the same species at a replacement rate of three trees for every tree removed. The City may authorize an alternative species or cultivar if it would be a more suitable and beneficial selection for a specific location given unique site characteristics.

B. When the required number of trees cannot be physically retained or replaced on site, the applicant has the option of:

1. Planting the required number of replacement trees at locations approved by the City prior to the time of occupancy of the building or final approval of the subdivision at the same rate as the replacement rate required for on-site replacement of trees; or

2. Payment in lieu of replacement may be made to the City tree account for planting of trees in priority off-site locations within the City. These are public street rights-of-way, public parks, and other public open spaces. The payment is an equivalent amount to the estimated cost of buying and planting the trees that would otherwise have been required to be planted on site, as determined by the City’s tree replacement cost schedule. The payment in lieu of planting trees on site shall be made prior to the issuance of any building permit or final subdivision approval.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.65.320 Tree maintenance and pruning.

Trees that are required to be maintained and replacement trees shall be pruned and trimmed as necessary to maintain a healthy growing condition or to prevent primary limb failure. Tree pruning shall be accomplished in accordance with the latest edition of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Publication NA-FR-01-95 How to Prune Trees available on the web, except that tree pruning for utilities shall be conducted in accordance with the latest edition of the International Society of Arboriculture’s Best Management Practices – Utility Pruning of Trees.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


19.65.330 Common area management plans.

In those cases where a residential development has common areas that are managed by a homeowner’s association, a common area management plan may be developed in lieu of obtaining consecutive tree removal permits. A common area management plan shall be developed by a certified or registered arborist and submitted to the City for review and approval.

(Ord. 673 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001. Formerly 19.65.320).

19.70.010 Accessory dwelling units.

A. Purpose. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are intended to increase the supply of affordable and independent housing for a variety of households, increase home and personal security, provide supplemental earnings for people with limited incomes, and increase residential densities. This should occur by utilizing the existing infrastructure and community resources throughout the City while protecting the existing character of single-family neighborhoods.

B. General Requirements. The creation of an ADU shall be subject to the following general requirements:

1. Number. One ADU shall be allowed per lot of record as an accessory use in conjunction with any detached single-family structure.

2. Type of Unit. An ADU may be attached to the principal unit, a separate detached accessory structure (e.g., cottage), or part of a detached accessory structure (e.g., carriage unit above garage).

3. Size. An attached ADU shall not exceed 800 square feet; provided, if the ADU is to be established within an existing multistory structure and located entirely on a single floor, the Director may allow increased size in order to efficiently use all area of this single floor. A detached ADU shall comply with the following building standards:

a. The total area of a detached ADU placed in a side or rear yard in accordance with UPMC 19.45.040(H) shall be no larger than 600 square feet in gross floor area;

b. Maintain five-foot minimum side and rear yard setbacks;

c. Have no portion of the structure, such as eaves, closer than three feet from any property line;

d. Be no greater than 18 feet in height at top of ridge and 10 feet at the top wall plate where the roof structure connects to the wall, if located within a required side or rear yard; and

e. Be no closer than five feet to the primary structure.

4. Design. An ADU shall be designed to maintain the appearance of the principal dwelling as a single-family residence.

a. Modifications to the exterior of an existing building intended to accommodate an ADU shall be architecturally consistent with the existing facade, roof pitch, siding, windows, and other exterior design elements and finish materials to the extent practicable. A detached ADU shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with the principal residence.

b. Only one entrance is permitted to be located on the front facade of the principal unit. The entrance to an attached ADU shall not be directed towards any front yard unless utilizing an existing doorway.

5. Parking. No additional off-street parking is required for an ADU. Any additional off-street parking provided in conjunction with an ADU shall, to the extent possible, be located to the side or rear of the principal unit to minimize visual impacts on the streetscape. Such parking must be provided in the rear of the lot when alley access is available. Off-street parking shall be designed to reduce impacts on adjoining properties through the installation of vegetative screening and/or fencing.

6. In order to encourage the development of housing units for people with disabilities, the Director may allow reasonable deviation from the requirements of this section when necessary to install features that facilitate accessibility. These facilities shall conform to Washington State regulations for barrier-free facilities.

C. Procedures. Any owner occupant seeking to establish an ADU shall apply for approval in accordance with the following procedures:

1. Application. The owner occupant shall apply for a building permit for an ADU. A complete application form must demonstrate that all size thresholds and design standards are met.

2. Property Owner. The property owner, which shall include title holders and contract purchasers, or an on-site property manager, must occupy either the principal unit or the ADU as their permanent residence, but not both, and at no time receive rent for the owner-occupied unit. An ADU shall be converted to another permitted use or shall be removed if one of the two dwelling units is not owner-occupied.

3. Affidavit. An affidavit affirming that the owner or an on-site property manager will occupy the principal dwelling or the ADU and agreeing to all the general requirements as provided in this chapter is required.

4. Notice of Title. Prior to issuance of building permits, the owner occupant shall record a notice on the property title acknowledging the existence of the ADU with the Pierce County Auditor. Such notice shall be in a form as specified by the Department.

5. Reports. The Department shall report annually to the City Council on ADU applications, the number of units established and their distribution throughout the City, the average size of the units, and the number and types of complaints and enforcement-related actions.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 559 § 10 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.70.020 Adult entertainment establishments.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate adult entertainment establishments and to provide certain limitations to the siting of these uses. Development standards are used to reduce conflicts between these uses and other uses that may not be compatible.

B. Uses Permitted. Adult entertainment establishments may be permitted by conditional use permit in the Light Industrial – Business Park zone pursuant to the City of University Place Comprehensive Plan and zoning ordinance as now and hereafter amended.

C. Locational Requirements. Distances provided in this section shall be measured by following a straight line, without regard for intervening buildings, from the nearest point of the parcel of property or the zone classification boundary line from which the proposed land use is to be separated.

1. Adult entertainment establishments shall not be located on lots abutting or adjacent to (directly touching or across a street from) any zone that allows residential uses.

2. Adult entertainment establishments shall not be allowed within 50 feet of any other adult business (as measured from property lines).

3. Adult entertainment establishments shall not be allowed within 50 feet of any “sensitive receptor.”

D. Variance to Locational Requirements. A variance to the dispersal provisions may be granted by the Hearings Examiner if all the following criteria can be met:

1. That free speech rights which are entitled to protection by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution of an applicant for an adult business cannot be adequately protected on parcels allowed for siting because other adult businesses are in place, or sensitive receptors limit additional uses in the IB zone.

2. That the natural or built environment in the immediate vicinity would result in an effective separation between the proposed adult entertainment establishment and any sensitive zones or uses in terms of visibility and access.

3. The proposed use complies with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.

4. The proposed use is otherwise compatible with abutting and surrounding land uses.

5. The applicant has proposed conditions that would minimize the secondary adverse effects of the proposed use.

E. Development Requirements. The development standards in this section shall apply to all buildings, uses, and property used for adult business or entertainment establishment purposes. The development standards for adult entertainment establishment uses are the same as the applicable zoning regulations for the zoning district in which they are located, except as follows:

1. Visual Impact.

a. No owner or operator of an adult business shall allow any merchandise or activity of the establishment to be visible from any point outside the establishment.

b. No owner or operator of an adult business shall allow the exterior to have flashing lights or any lettering, photographs, silhouettes, drawings, or pictorial representations of any kind other than to the extent permitted by this section or Chapter 19.75 UPMC, Signs.

c. The exterior of an adult business, if painted, must be painted (stained or otherwise colored) in a single achromatic color, except if:

(1) The adult business is part of a commercial multi-unit center; and

(2) The exteriors of each individual unit in the commercial multi-unit center, including the adult business, are painted the same color as one another or are painted in such a way so as to be a component of the overall architectural style or pattern of the commercial center.

2. Signage. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Chapter 19.75 UPMC, the following restrictions apply to any adult business:

a. There may be no more than two signs (one freestanding sign and one wall sign, or two wall signs), even if the business fronts on more than one street. Each display surface of a sign must:

(1) Be a flat plane, rectangular in shape;

(2) Not be flashing or pulsating;

(3) Have characters of a solid color;

(4) Have all characters of the same print type, size, and color; and

(5) Have all background in one solid color.

b. Readerboard signs are not allowed.

F. Nonconforming Adult Entertainment Establishments. An adult entertainment use shall be deemed a legal conforming use and shall be subject to the requirements of Chapter 19.80 UPMC, Nonconforming Lots, Uses, and Structures, if a zone that allows residential uses is located abutting or adjacent to the adult entertainment establishment or if a sensitive receptor identified in Chapter 19.10 UPMC locates within 50 feet of the adult entertainment establishment facility after the date the adult entertainment facility has located within the City in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(Ord. 607 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.70.030 Agricultural uses and animals.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate agricultural uses and animals and to provide certain limitations for the placement of these uses. Minimum lot sizes, setbacks, and best management practices are used to reduce conflicts between land uses that may not be compatible and to protect environmentally sensitive areas.

B. Exceptions.

1. Hobby Farms. Farm animals, agricultural activities, and associated structures may be established on any lot as a noncommercial use without an associated dwelling unit, provided:

a. The applicant completes a hobby farm agreement provided by the Department. Each hobby farm agreement shall:

b. Except as provided in this chapter, all pole or pylon signs shall be supported by two or more supports.

c. Sign Face. The color, shape, material, lettering and other architectural details of the sign face must be harmonious with the character of the primary structure.

D. Minor Deviations. Minor deviations from the dimensional standards for signs, except for maximum sign height, may be approved by the Director upon finding that the resulting sign does not significantly change the relative proportion of the sign base to the sign face.

E. Electric Signs. Electric signs shall be constructed and inspected in accordance with applicable electrical codes.

F. Public Right-of-Way. Signs in the public right-of-way shall be regulated by UPMC Title 13 and require a valid right-of-way use permit pursuant to UPMC Title 13. Any sign located in a public right-of-way without a valid right-of-way permit is hereby declared a public nuisance. Any unlawful sign may be removed from a public right-of-way immediately.

G. Planter Boxes – Bumper Guards – Shrubs – Plants. No planter box or bumper guard designed to protect or beautify a sign structure shall extend beyond the property line. Planter boxes shall not be more than 36 inches above average finished grade.

H. Utility Lines – Clearance. Horizontal and vertical clearance of signs or sign structures from utility lines shall be determined by the appropriate service provider.

(Ord. 699 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


19.75.070 General sign requirements.

The size and placement of signs are regulated to maintain a safe and attractive community and to facilitate attention to their messages. The following standards are intended to aid the sign user, sign maker and the Department in determining the maximum size and appropriate location of permitted signs:

A. General Sign Requirements.

1. Area of Signs.

a. The area of a sign means the area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the outer limits of the sign face, but not including structural elements which are not a part of the display.

b. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the sign faces. No more than two faces are permitted per freestanding sign. The area of a spherical, cubical or polyhedral sign equals one-half the total surface area.

2. Area of Freestanding Letters. Freestanding letters and/or characters forming a sign or message shall be considered to occupy two-thirds of the combined overall background area.

3. Height of Signs. Maximum height of all freestanding signs or any part of the freestanding sign structure shall be 10 feet above average finished grade. Sign height shall be measured from the average finished grade at the sign foundation. The average finished grade for signs on grades lower than the adjacent right-of-way shall be considered the same as the average grade of the adjacent right-of-way. See the diagram following subsection (A)(7) of this section for grade exceptions.

4. Width of Signs. The maximum width of a freestanding sign structure shall be 12 feet. Sign width shall be measured on the face side of the sign from one side of the face or any part of the sign structure to the farthest point on the opposite side of the face or part of the sign structure.

5. Setbacks for Signs. All signs are permitted a zero-foot setback, except as provided in this chapter, provided the owner demonstrates to the City by reasonable evidence that the sign will not obstruct the clear sight zone as specified in UPMC Title 13.

6. Illumination. External sign illumination shall be directed only towards the sign face or freestanding letters and shall be shielded in ways to prevent light and glare on adjacent properties.

7. Grade Exception. When the elevation at the base of a freestanding sign is at least five feet below the elevation of the adjacent road, a single pole may be used to support the sign provided the portion of the sign above the elevation of the adjacent roadway has the appearance of a monument sign. See figure below.

8. Maintenance of Signs. All signs shall be maintained in a safe condition and in good repair. Any sign that is damaged shall be restored to a safe condition and good repair no later than 90 days after the event that caused the damage. Failure to maintain a sign in a safe condition and in good repair shall be grounds for revocation of a sign permit.

9. Establishment of Property Lines. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner or an authorized representative to establish and clearly mark out any property line from which a sign setback measurement shall be taken. In the event of a dispute or discrepancy, the Director may order an independent survey to ensure compliance with this chapter. The survey cost shall be charged to the sign applicant.

(Ord. 699 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).

2. Additional requirements are listed in UPMC 19.75.090, Specific sign requirements.

3. See Chapters 19.35, Temporary Uses, and 5.10 UPMC, Special Events, for additional requirements.

Exemption from the sign permit provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any sign constructed, erected or located in any manner in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any other laws or ordinances of the City or the State of Washington, including the prohibition against placing signs upon City right-of-way.

(Ord. 699 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


19.75.090 Specific sign requirements.

A. Digital Signs. The purpose of this section is to regulate how digital signage technology might be applied to sign types otherwise permitted by this chapter. It is not intended to allow more signs or larger signs than otherwise permitted by this chapter.

1. One digital sign is allowed per 100 feet of street frontage in nonresidential zones.

2. Maximum luminance of not more than 0.2 foot-candles between off and solid-message at night shall be measured in accordance with subsection (A)(3) of this section. All permitted digital signs shall be equipped with a sensor or other device that automatically determines ambient illumination and is programmed to automatically dim according to ambient light conditions.

3. Electronic Message Center (EMC) Illumination Measurement Criteria. The illuminance of an EMC shall be measured with an illuminance meter set to measure foot-candles accurate to at least two decimals. Illuminance shall be measured with the EMC off, and again with the EMC displaying a white image for a full color-capable EMC, or a solid message for a single-color EMC. All measurements shall be taken as close as practical to a perpendicular plane of the sign at the distance determined by the total square footage of the EMC as set forth in the Sign Area of a Sign versus Measurement Distance table below.

SIGN AREA VERSUS MEASUREMENT DISTANCE  

	AREA OF SIGN sq. ft.	MEASUREMENT (ft.)

	10	32

	15	39

	20	45

	25	50

	30	55

	35	59

	40	63

	45	67

	50	71

* For signs with an area in square feet other than those specifically listed in the table (i.e., 12 sq. ft., 400 sq. ft., etc.), the measurement distance may be calculated with the following formula:

Measurement Distance = Area of Sign Sq. Ft. x 100

4. No motion allowed except for instantaneous change of message.

5. Minimum hold between messages: eight seconds plus one-and-one-half-second transition fade.

6. Programming. To ensure that digital signs are programmed and continue to operate according to local standards, digital signs shall be designed for local on-site control and programming only.

B. Electronic Message Center (EMC) Signs. The purpose of this section is to regulate how EMC signage might be applied to free standing signs permitted by this chapter. It is not intended to allow more signs or larger signs than otherwise permitted by this chapter.

1. Where Allowed. Electronic message center (EMC) signs are only allowed in the community commercial and neighborhood commercial zones.

2. Maximum luminance of not more than 0.2 foot-candles between off and solid-message at night shall be measured in accordance with subsection (B)(3) of this section. All EMCs shall be equipped with a sensor or other device that automatically determines ambient illumination and is programmed to automatically dim according to ambient light conditions.

3. Electronic Message Center (EMC) Illumination Measurement Criteria. The illuminance of an EMC shall be measured with an illuminance meter set to measure foot-candles accurate to at least two decimals. Illuminance shall be measured with the EMC off, and again with the EMC displaying a white image for a full color-capable EMC, or a solid message for a single-color EMC. All measurements shall be taken as close as practical to a perpendicular plane of the sign at the distance determined by the total square footage of the EMC as set forth in the Sign Area versus Measurement Distance table (subsection (A)(3) of this section).

4. Motion Limits. No motion except for a fade-in of the next message with the fade transition being no more nor less than one and one-half seconds. Fade transition is required rather than instantaneous message changes to avoid sudden or startling flashes of light.

5. Minimum hold between messages: eight seconds, plus one-and-one-half-second transition fade.

6. Programming. To ensure that EMC signs are programmed and continue to operate according to local standards, EMC signs shall be programmed on site only. Remote programming in an off-site location is prohibited.

7. Existing EMC signs legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance that are nonconforming to the preceding operational standards shall be made compliant within 90 days of written notice to the owner of legally established EMC signs.

C. Temporary Commercial Signs.

1. Three signs per tenant may be displayed for the duration of the temporary use or event for which they are intended but not for longer than 60 days in a year.

2. Signs shall be removed at the close of each business day.

3. Signs must be removed within three working days after the expiration of the permit, or the event. Failure to remove signs will forfeit use of a temporary sign permit for a period of 12 months.

4. Signs may not be permanently attached to the ground, building, or other structure.

D. Temporary Residential/Commercial Development Sign.

1. One double-faced sign is permitted per street front.

2. No sign shall exceed 32 square feet in surface area or 10 feet in height.

3. Signs may only be erected in conjunction with an issued building or land use permit.

4. Signs must be removed when the last lot is sold in a subdivision or upon final occupancy approval of a commercial development.

E. Temporary Noncommercial Signs.

1. No sign permit is required to post a non-commercial temporary sign in the public right-of-way or on private property if it meets the requirements in this section and in the following table. Noncommercial temporary signs not conforming to the regulations of this section may be approved through a right-of-way permit.

2. Signs shall be placed at the periphery of the right-of-way. On roads that only have a shoulder and do not have a sidewalk, non-commercial temporary signs must be placed beyond the edge of the asphalt, and may not be placed so that any part of the sign extends over the asphalt.

3. Noncommercial temporary signs shall not be placed in a manner that negatively affects the health of trees, shrubs, or other landscaping.

4. Placement of off-premises noncommercial temporary signs on private property is subject to the landowner’s authorization.

F. Noncommercial Signs in Right-of-Way.

	Sign Type	A-Board	Yard Sign

	Maximum Size	6	4

	Maximum Height	3.5'	3'

	Duration	5 consecutive days	180 days

G. Awning – Canopy – Marquee.

1. Awnings shall project not less than three feet and not more than seven feet from the face of the supporting building, when over public property.

2. No portion of any awning or canopy shall extend nearer than two feet to the face of the nearest curbline.

3. Area of an awning or canopy sign is counted in the maximum area for all signs on a facade, including wall, window and roof signs combined.

H. Roof Signs. Roof signs shall not project above any roof line, soffit or parapet. See examples of acceptable and unacceptable roof signs below. Area of a roof sign is counted in the maximum area for all signs on a facade, including wall, window and awning signs combined.

I. Yard Sale Signs. Off-premises signs posted at locations away from the location(s) of the sales are subject to the following provisions:

1. The signs may be placed adjacent to the right-of-way with the property owner’s permission.

2. Yard sale signs shall not be posted sooner than 5:00 p.m. on the day prior to the sale and shall be removed immediately following the end of the sale.

3. Yard sale signs must include the address where the yard sale is located and a date or dates of the sale.

4. Signs for yard sales shall not be allowed for more than four successive calendar days in a 30-day period and shall be limited to advertising not more than three yard sale events in the same calendar year at the same location.

5. A fine of $100.00 per yard sale sign which exceeds these provisions may be levied against the property owner where the sales are held.

19.75.100 Removal of sign for vacant premises.

Within 30 days of a change of use, the sign face of any sign associated with the former use shall be removed or changed. If the removal or change of the sign face exposes any structural, electrical, or illumination fixtures, an opaque covering, or other material approved by the Director, shall be placed over the exposed fixtures.

(Ord. 699 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


19.75.110 Nonconforming signs.

A. Nonconforming Signs. Upon determination that a sign is nonconforming or illegal, the Director shall use reasonable efforts to so notify in writing the sign owner and where practicable the owner of the property on which the sign is located. Notification shall include:

1. Whether the sign is conforming, nonconforming or illegal;

2. Whether the sign may be eligible for a sign permit. If the identity of the sign owner cannot be determined after reasonable inquiry, the notice may be affixed in a conspicuous place on the sign or on the business premises with which the sign is associated;

3. The reasons the sign is nonconforming or illegal;

4. A time period in which to comply with the sign code prior to the commencement of code enforcement.

B. Nonconforming signs shall either be removed or immediately brought into compliance with this chapter upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:

Chapter 19.80 NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, AND STRUCTURES

Sections:

19.80.010    Applicability.

19.80.020    Intent.

19.80.030    Nonconforming lots.

19.80.040    Nonconforming uses.

19.80.050    Nonconforming structures.

19.80.060    Nonconforming parking, loading, signs, landscaping and other required improvements.

19.80.070    Unclassified use permits.


19.80.010 Applicability.

This chapter applies to any land, structure, or use that became nonconforming after August 31, 1995, by the passage of any zoning ordinance of the City.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.80.020 Intent.

This chapter is intended to permit legal nonconforming developments, lots, structures and uses to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their perpetuation. It is further intended that nonconforming developments, lots, structures and uses not be enlarged upon, expanded, extended or be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district.

Because nonconforming developments, lots, structures and uses do not conform to requirements of the zone where they are located, they are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with the permitted developments, lots, structures and uses in the zone.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.80.030 Nonconforming lots.

The party asserting the existence of a lawful nonconforming lot has the burden of establishing that the lot was not substandard according to the requirements in effect at the time of its creation. 

A. Nonconforming Single Lots. Any nonconforming single lot, tract or parcel of land that was lawfully created and recorded with the county auditor’s office prior to August 31, 1995, may be used for the purposes permitted by this title notwithstanding the minimum lot area required.

B. Any permitted uses or structures, including any accessory uses or structures permitted in conjunction with a principal use, shall be allowed to be built or expanded on a nonconforming lot. Compliance with applicable development standards such as height and setbacks is required.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.80.040 Nonconforming uses.

The party asserting the existence of a lawful nonconforming use has the burden of establishing that as of August 31, 1995, the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or subsequent revisions or amendments, the use was either consistent with the zoning provisions or was a pre-existing legal nonconforming use.

A legal nonconforming use may be continued; provided, that:

A. The nonconforming use is not replaced by a conforming use. If replaced by a conforming use, the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.

B. Vacation or Discontinuation. A nonconforming use may be continued by successive owners or tenants where the use is not vacated. If the use is vacated or discontinued for 12 consecutive months, the subsequent use of the land shall be conforming.

C. Expansion on Land, in Buildings or Structures. The nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, increased, expanded or extended to occupy a greater area of land, building or structure than was occupied on the date the use became nonconforming; except, if the nonconforming use is an accessory use and the principal use is a conforming use, the conforming principal use may expand so long as the nonconforming accessory use is not made more nonconforming.

D. The use is not moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel or another lot or parcel in a zone where the structure would be nonconforming.

E. Substantial Destruction. If the structure on which the use depends is harmed or destroyed by more than 50 percent of the improvement value as shown in the County Assessor’s data, the nonconforming use can no longer continue, except when the structure is damaged or destroyed as a result of accidental fire or natural causes, in which case permits to reconstruct a structure in order to continue the nonconforming use shall be applied for within one year of damage. Restoration or reconstruction must be substantially completed within 12 months of permit issuance.

F. Exception for Single-Family Detached Houses. Any existing nonconforming single-family detached housing unit may be expanded as an exception to the basic rules on expansion of nonconforming uses.

(Ord. 703 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 514 § 6, 2008; Ord. 455 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.80.050 Nonconforming structures.

The party asserting the existence of a lawful nonconforming structure has the burden of establishing that as of August 31, 1995, the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or subsequent revision or amendments, the structure was constructed in conformance with the zoning provisions in place at the time the structure was built, or that the structure was built pursuant to the granting of a variance.

A. A nonconforming structure may remain and be used; provided, that:

1. The nonconforming portion of the structure shall not be expanded in any direction which increases its degree of nonconformity, except as specifically authorized through a variance (see UPMC 19.85.030, Variances).

2. If moved, the structure shall be made to conform to regulations of this code.

3. Normal Upkeep, Repairs and Maintenance. Normal upkeep, repairs, maintenance, strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any nonconforming building or structure or part thereof shall be permitted subject to the provisions of this section.

4. Substantial Destruction. If the structure is harmed or destroyed by more than 50 percent of the improvement value as shown in the County Assessor’s data, the structure must be reconstructed in compliance with the requirements of the zone in which it is located. Structures damaged or destroyed as a result of intentional acts by someone other than the owner may be replaced in the same location and to the same dimensions as the original structure.

5. Permits to reconstruct a nonconforming structure after damage by fire, or natural causes where more than 50 percent of the structure’s value remains, shall be applied for within one year of damage. Restoration or reconstruction must be substantially completed within 12 months of permit issuance.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.80.060 Nonconforming parking, loading, signs, landscaping and other required improvements.

If improvements required for a given use including but not limited to off-street parking, signs, landscaping, and open space are not in accordance with the requirements of this title, no change that increases the nonconformity with such requirements is permitted. Change that decreases the nonconformity to the requirements of this title is permitted.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.80.070 Unclassified use permits.

Unless redefined as a conditional use permit, in accordance with Chapter 19.85 UPMC, unclassified use permits shall be considered nonconforming uses and subject to the requirements of this chapter.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).

19.85.010 Administrative use permits.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish decision criteria and procedures for uses that, due to their unique qualities, may require additional regulations or other special degrees of control. An administrative review process, which includes public notice and comment, is required to ensure that the activity, if established, will be in full compliance with applicable regulations and that such uses are compatible with the Comprehensive Plan, adjacent uses, and the character of the vicinity.

Administrative use permits include:

1. Accessory dwelling units;

2. RV permits;

3. Telecommunication facility review;

4. Temporary uses; and

5. Tree permits.

B. Decision Criteria. The Director shall review applications for administrative use permits in accordance with specific findings as set forth below.

1. Requirements and Decision Criteria Unique to Certain Uses. The development standards of this code shall be used by the applicant in preparing the administrative use permit application and by the Director in determining the acceptability of permitting a use in a certain location.

2. Required Findings. The Director shall grant approval of an administrative use permit if all of the criteria pertaining to that type of permit (such as a home occupation permit) and all of the following findings can be made and supported by the record:

a. That the granting of the proposed administrative use permit approval will not:

i. Be detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare;

ii. Adversely affect the established character of the surrounding vicinity; nor

iii. Be injurious to the uses, property, or improvements adjacent to, and in the vicinity of, the site upon which the proposed use is to be located;

b. That the granting of the proposed administrative use permit approval is consistent and compatible with the intent of goals, objectives, and policies of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, and any implementing regulation;

c. That all conditions necessary to mitigate the impacts of the proposed use can be monitored and enforced; and

d. That all requirements for a specific use have been addressed by the applicant.

C. Burden of Proof. The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed use meets all criteria set forth in subsection (B)(2) of this section, Required Findings.

D. Approval. The Director may approve an application for an administrative use permit, approve with additional requirements above those specified in this code, or require modification of the proposal to comply with specified requirements or local conditions.

E. Denial. The Director may deny an application for an administrative use permit if the placement of the use would be unreasonably incompatible with the surrounding area or incapable of complying with specific standards set forth in this code, and if any of the above required findings are not supported by evidence in the record as determined by the Director.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 §2, 2001).


19.85.020 Conditional use permits.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish decision criteria and procedures for special uses, called conditional uses, which possess unique characteristics. Conditional uses are deemed unique due to factors such as size, technological processes, equipment, or location with respect to surroundings, streets, existing improvements, or demands upon public facilities. These uses require a special degree of control to assure compatibility with the Comprehensive Plan, adjacent uses, and the character of the vicinity.

Conditional uses will be subject to review by the Examiner and the issuance of a conditional use permit. This process allows the Examiner to:

1. Determine that the location of these uses will not be incompatible with uses permitted in the surrounding areas; and

2. Make further stipulations and conditions that may reasonably assure that the basic intent of this code will be served.

B. Decision Criteria. The Examiner shall review conditional use permit applications in accordance with the provisions of this section and may approve, approve with conditions, modify, modify with conditions, or deny the conditional use permit. The Examiner may reduce or increase bulk requirements, off-street parking requirements, and use design standards to lessen impacts, as a condition of the granting of the conditional use permit.

1. Required Findings. The Examiner may use design standards and other elements in this code to modify the proposal. A conditional use permit may be approved only if all of the following findings can be made regarding the proposal and are supported by the record:

a. That the granting of the proposed conditional use permit will not:

i. Be detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare;

ii. Adversely affect the established character of the surrounding vicinity; nor

iii. Be injurious to the uses, property, or improvements adjacent to, and in the vicinity of, the site upon which the proposed use is to be located;

b. That the granting of the proposed conditional use permit is consistent and compatible with the intent of the vision statement, goals, and policies of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, and any implementing regulation;

c. That all conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposed use can be monitored and enforced;

d. That the proposed use will not introduce hazardous conditions at the site that cannot be mitigated to protect adjacent properties, the vicinity, and the public health, safety, and welfare of the community from such hazard;

e. That the conditional use will be supported by, and not adversely affect, adequate public facilities and services, or that conditions can be imposed to lessen any adverse impacts on such facilities and services; and

f. That the level of service standards for public facilities and services are met in accordance with the concurrency management requirements.

C. Additional Required Findings for Public Facilities.

1. That the granting of the proposed conditional use permit is consistent and compatible with the intent of the goals, objectives and policies of comprehensive, general or utility plans for sewage, stormwater, water, solid waste, park and recreation, transportation or other facility plans, capital facility plan or capital improvement programs.

2. That the facility site and environmental designs:

a. Meet local and State siting criteria and design requirements adopted as standard mitigation and as administrated by local and State agencies; and

b. Have been reviewed and commented upon by local and State agencies responsible for issuing permits; and

3. That all yards, open spaces, landscaping, walls and fences, and other buffering features are properly provided to mitigate the impacts of the facility to make it compatible with the character of the surrounding area.

D. Burden of Proof. The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed conditional use meets all of the criteria in subsection (B)(1) of this section, Required Findings.

E. Approval. The Examiner may approve an application for a conditional use permit, approve with additional requirements above those specified in this code or require modification of the proposal to comply with specified requirements or local conditions.

F. Denial. The Examiner shall deny a conditional use permit if the proposal does not meet or cannot be conditioned or modified to meet subsection (B)(1) of this section, Required Findings.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.85.030 Variances.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a means of altering the requirements of this code in specific instances where the strict application of those requirements would deprive a property of privileges enjoyed by other properties with the identical regulatory zone because of special features or constraints unique to the property involved.

B. Administrative and Examiner Variances. There are two types of variances hereby established. A “minor” or administrative variance, and a “major” or Examiner variance. An administrative variance is one which is within 25 percent of the standard contained in the code. An Examiner variance is one that is greater than 25 percent of the standard contained in the code. Both types are based on the same decision criteria, as found in subsection (E) of this section.

C. Granting of Variances. The Director and the Examiner shall have the authority to grant a variance from the provisions of this code, when, in their opinions, the conditions as set forth in subsections (E) and (F) of this section have been found to exist. In such cases a variance may be granted which is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this code so that the spirit of this code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The Director or Examiner shall only grant the minimum necessary variance to grant relief to the applicant.

D. Variances shall not relieve an applicant from any of the procedural provisions of this title, from any standard or provision that specifically states that no variance from such standard or provision is permitted, or from conditions of approval established during prior permit review. A variance shall not allow establishment of a use that is not otherwise permitted in the zone, including the creation of lots or densities that exceed the base residential density of the zone. A variance cannot be used to relieve an applicant from any of the provisions of the critical areas code, except for the required buffer widths.

E. Decision Criteria. Before any variance may be granted, it shall be shown that the applicant demonstrates all of the following:

1. That the granting of such variance will not adversely affect the Comprehensive Plan;

2. That there are special circumstances applicable to the subject property or to the intended use such as shape, topography, location, or surroundings that do not apply generally to the other property or class of use in the same vicinity and zone;

3. That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zone but which because of special circumstances is denied to the property in question;

4. That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvement in such vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located;

5. That strict enforcement of the provisions of this title creates an unnecessary hardship to the property owner; and

6. That the need for the variance is not the result of deliberate actions of the applicant or property owner.

F. Burden of Proof. The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed variance meets all of the criteria in subsection (E) of this section, Decision Criteria.

G. Approval. The Director or Examiner may approve an application for a variance, approve with additional requirements above those specified in this code or require modification of the proposal to comply with specified requirements or local conditions.

H. Denial. The Director or Examiner shall deny a variance if the proposal does not meet or cannot be conditioned or modified to meet subsection (E) of this section, Decision Criteria.

(Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 330 § 1, 2001; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001).


19.85.040 Public facilities permits.

A. Public Facility Permits Repealed. Existing public facility permits are considered conditional use permits. Public facilities allowed subject to a conditional use permit must meet the required findings in UPMC 19.85.020(C).

B. Recognition of Previously Granted Permits for Public Facilities. Any previously granted development permit, zoning permit or otherwise lawfully established public facility and/or activity, which existed prior to the effective date of these regulations, are hereby acknowledged and reaffirmed by these provisions. These previously granted authorities include but are not limited to unclassified use permit, conditional use permit, nonconforming use permit, planned development district, planned unit development, conditional change in zone, variances, and similar permits and approvals.

Each of these previously granted authorities are hereby defined as an existing and approved conditional use permit under these regulations, subject to any specific conditions imposed on the approval of said authority. Any public facility and/or activity which does not possess one of these authorities, but has been legally established prior to the effective date of these regulations, shall be defined as an existing and approved public facility permit, but shall be subject to the limitations imposed on all legally established uses under the bulk regulations and special use design standards until the specific permit is amended pursuant to these regulations.

Any facility or activity which possesses a conditional use permit as established herein shall not be defined as a nonconforming use under these regulations. Existing state and federal permits, including, but not limited to, federal mining permits and leases, surface mine permits (SM), National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits (NPDES), and solid waste permits may be used to aid in the establishment of a public facility permit for any existing facility or activity. The Department shall establish and maintain a list of these permits.

(Ord. 559 § 11 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 443 § 1 (Exh. A), 2005; Ord. 394 § 1, 2003; Ord. 330 § 2, 2001; Ord. 307 § 2, 2001. Formerly 19.85.050).


19.85.050 Administrative design review.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for the review of small lot and multifamily developments for which design review is required. In addition, these procedures apply to projects that are subject to compliance with the design standards and guidelines for the MU, MU-O and MU-M zones per Chapter 19.50 UPMC, the TC zone per Chapter 19.51 UPMC, and the CC zone per Chapter 19.52 UPMC. The design review process is intended to enable the City to evaluate development proposals with respect to architectural design, landscape design, urban form, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, utility design, and site characteristics. The process allows the City to condition development proposals to ensure their compatibility with adjoining uses, compliance with development regulations, and consistency with Comprehensive Plan goals, objectives and policies. The process is intended to ensure that all critical design issues are addressed early in the site planning and review stages of project development.

B. Authority. The Director is authorized to review development proposals subject to administrative design review. The Director may approve, approve with conditions, modify and approve with conditions, or deny, the application for administrative design review. The City shall grant design approval when the Director has determined that the criteria listed in subsection (C) of this section have been met by the proposal. The Director may impose specific conditions upon the use, including an increase in the standards of this title, which will enable the Director to make the required findings in subsection (C) of this section. These conditions may include, but are not limited to: restrictions on locations of structures and uses; structural restrictions that address safety, noise, light and glare, vibration, views, aesthetics, and other impacts; and increased buffering requirements, including open space, berms, fencing and landscaping.

C. Criteria for Administrative Design Review Approval. Before any administrative design approval may be granted, the Director shall adopt written findings showing that the following criteria are met by the proposal:

1. The proposed use and site design will not: be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity; or adversely affect the established character of the surrounding vicinity.

2. The proposed use and site design will meet or exceed all applicable development, performance and design standards and conform to the intent of the design guidelines that apply to the specific use, location, or zoning classification.

3. The proposed use and site design will be consistent and compatible with the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.

4. All conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposed use are measurable and can be monitored and enforced.

D. Application Procedures. Administrative design review is classified as a Type II application. The processing procedures for this application are described in Chapter 22.05 UPMC.

E. Preapplication Review. Applicants are encouraged to schedule a preapplication meeting with the City’s technical review committee prior to formal project application. An applicant may present schematic sketches and a general outline of the proposal for a preliminary staff review. The meeting is intended to provide a prospective applicant with information concerning application procedures, submittal requirements and design standards and guidelines that may be applicable to the proposal. The meeting is also intended to provide a prospective applicant with early input and initial design direction from City staff on the proposal. The completion of this preapplication review process does not vest any future application.

F. Final Design Review. The Director may determine that a design submittal generally meets the criteria listed in subsection (C) of this section but includes specific design elements that will require a more detailed review later in the design process to demonstrate full compliance. In such case, the Director may grant design review approval subject to the submittal and approval of additional detailed plans. This final design review is intended to ensure that all specific design issues identified during the Director’s initial review are fully addressed prior to issuance of a building permit, site development permit or other construction permit.

G. Submittal Requirements. Application for administrative design review shall be submitted on forms provided by the City. A minimum of 10 sets of the following plans, materials, and other applicable information shall be submitted with the application in clear and intelligible form:

1. A site plan drawing at a scale of not less than one inch per 50 feet that shows:

a. The location of all existing and proposed structures and improvements, including, but not limited to, fences, culverts, bridges, roads and streets on the subject property;

11. The proposed number of square feet in gross floor area for each residential and nonresidential use; and

12. For properties containing critical areas or their regulated buffers, all informational requirements specified in UPMC Title 17, Critical Areas, shall be included in the design review submittal.

H. Waiver of Submittal Requirements. The Director may waive the submittal requirement for any of the items listed in subsection (G) of this section when, in the reasonable discretion of the Director, the item is inapplicable or unnecessary for the completion of the design review.

I. Request for Additional Information. The Director may require the applicant to submit additional information or material that is necessary for the proper review of the application.

J. Performance Bond. The Director may require as a condition of administrative design review approval that the applicant furnish the City with a performance bond, or other form of guarantee deemed acceptable by the City Attorney, to secure the applicant’s obligation to complete the provisions and conditions of the design submittal as approved. If a performance guarantee is required under this section, the property owner shall provide the City with an irrevocable notarized agreement granting the City and its agents the right to enter the property and perform any necessary work.

(Ord. 662 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 628 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 559 § 11 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.85.060 Amendments to discretionary land use permits.

A. Amendment Standards – Discretionary Land Use Permits. This section provides the method for amending conditions of approval and final development plans that have received discretionary land use permit approval.

1. Minor Amendment. Minor amendments shall be consistent with the requirements set forth in subsection (A)(1)(c) of this section, and shall include, but not be limited to, adjustments to site plan and structure layout, provided the adjustment is generally consistent with the original approval; minor adjustments to site access, parking area layout, additions of fences, retaining walls, and mechanical equipment; adjustments to building height, provided the height is below the maximum allowed in the zone; and adjustments to the landscaping plans such as changes to plant materials.

The following procedures shall be required for all minor amendments.

a. Requests for minor amendments shall be in writing from the property owner or the owner’s authorized agent and shall fully describe the amendments requested and the reasons therefor.

b. Minor amendment applications may be routed for comments to any City division and to any agency with jurisdiction at the Director’s discretion.

c. Minor amendments shall meet all of the following requirements:

i. A change to a condition of approval does not modify the intent of the original condition.

ii. The perimeter boundaries of the original site shall not be extended by more than five percent of the original lot area.

iii. The proposal does not increase the overall residential density of a site.

iv. The proposal does not change or modify housing types.

v. The proposal does not reduce the designated open space.

vi. The proposal does not add more than five percent gross square footage of structures to the site.

vii. The proposal does not increase the overall impervious surface on the site by more than five percent.

viii. Any conditions or expansions approved through minor amendments that cumulatively exceed the requirements in this section shall be reviewed as a major amendment.

d. Burden of Proof. The applicant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed amendment meets all of the criteria in subsection (A)(1)(c) of this section.

e. Approval. The Director may approve an application for a minor amendment, approve with additional conditions, require modification of the proposal to comply with specified requirements or determine that the application shall be processed as a major amendment.

f. Denial. The Director shall deny an application for amendment if the proposal does not meet or cannot be conditioned to meet subsection (A)(1)(c) of this section.

g. The Director’s decision may be appealed as provided in UPMC Title 22.

2. Major Amendments.

b. Major amendments shall be subject to the most current City codes.

(Ord. 559 § 11 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.85.070 Duration of a discretionary land use permit approval.

If a discretionary land use permit approval is not exercised within one year from the effective date of approval, or within five years from the effective date of an administrative design approval associated with a preliminary plat or short plat, it shall automatically become null and void. For good cause, the appropriate review authority (Hearings Examiner or Director) may grant a one-time extension of one year if an extension request is filed with the Department no less than 45 days prior to the date of expiration. A properly filed application for a time extension shall stay the effective date of expiration until action on the request has become final. The process for taking action on the request shall be the same used for the original discretionary land use permit application. Before taking action to grant an extension, the review authority shall adopt written findings showing that the following circumstances exist:

A. The proposal approved under the terms of the discretionary land use permit application originally granted remains in conformance with current development standards and design guidelines contained or referenced in this title. If the proposal would no longer conform to this title as a result of more restrictive standards or guidelines being adopted subsequent to the original approval, the review authority may consider a modified proposal that would comply with the more restrictive standards or guidelines.

B. The findings adopted in support of the original discretionary land use permit approval remain valid and supportive of the time extension request.

(Ord. 559 § 11 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.85.080 Revocation.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures to be followed when action is initiated to revoke a discretionary land use permit.

B. Authority. The Hearings Examiner may revoke or modify a major variance, conditional use permit or planned development district approval when it has determined that one or more of the grounds listed in subsection (E) of this section exists. The Director may revoke or modify an administrative use permit, minor variance or administrative design review approval when it has determined that one or more of the grounds listed in subsection (E) of this section exists.

C. Initiation of a Revocation. Revocation may be initiated by a request from an adversely affected property owner or other aggrieved party, a motion by the City Council to refer the matter to the Hearings Examiner, or the Director.

D. Procedures. Review of a motion, recommendation or request for revocation by the appropriate review authority shall be conducted in the same manner as was required for the initial consideration of the discretionary land use permit. Procedures concerning public notice, reporting and appeals shall be the same as for the initial review.

E. Grounds for Revocation or Modification. A revocation or modification of a discretionary land use permit by the appropriate review authority shall be made on any one or more of the following grounds:

1. The approval was obtained by deception, fraud or other misrepresentations;

2. The use for which the approval was granted has ceased to exist or has been suspended for one year or more;

3. That the permit granted is being, or recently has been, exercised contrary to the terms or conditions of the approval or the applicable development regulations that govern the permit; or

4. The use for which the approval was granted was so exercised as to be detrimental to the public health or safety.

F. Submittal Requirements. A request for a revocation by an adversely affected property owner or other aggrieved party shall be submitted on forms provided by the Department. The party requesting the revocation shall submit a statement indicating the specific grounds listed in subsection (E) of this section that provide the basis for the request. Based on a preliminary review of the request, the Director may determine that additional information is necessary to complete the review and shall be provided by the party requesting the revocation.

(Ord. 559 § 11 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.85.090 Relinquishment of discretionary land use approvals.

A property owner may elect to relinquish a previously approved discretionary land use permit in order to obtain another use or density which is now permitted outright under a new zone classification. In recognition of the relinquishment, any use authorized by the discretionary land use permit shall cease, unless said use is allowed outright under the underlying zone classification. The petitioner for relinquishment shall follow the following process:

A. The property owner must submit in writing to the Department the request including the reasons for the relinquishment. Accompanying the request should be a copy of the original approval.

B. The request will be reviewed by staff to determine if any conditions of the original approval conflict with the request for relinquishment. If the conditions or terms of the discretionary land use permit conflict with the request, the request will be forwarded to the Director or Examiner, as appropriate to the original review procedure for a decision.

C. The Department will respond in writing to the owner with a determination and provide the Examiner a copy of that determination.

(Ord. 559 § 11 (Exh. A), 2009).


19.85.100 Time calculations.

Any reference to a time period, unless otherwise specifically stated, shall be calculated based upon calendar days.

Amendments to short plats may be approved by the Department by approving an amendment note that states to the effect that the amended short plat supersedes “Short Plat No. ___.” The note must specify the changes, and before the Department can approve the amended short plat, all City requirements and conditions stated on the original short plat must be stated on the amended short plat.

If any City department’s or other agency’s previous approval may be affected by the amendment (as determined by the Department), said department or agency will be notified of the change and be given the opportunity to comment before the Department approves the amendment. In addition, any amendment involving public dedication must be processed as provided in RCW 58.17.212 or 58.17.215. A fee as set forth in separate resolution shall be paid to the Department for the processing of an amended short plat.

The assessor-treasurer’s office must again signify that the current real estate taxes are paid before the amended short plat is recorded. Upon recording, the amended short plat is deemed approved by the City. After recording, the applicant shall provide a copy of the recorded short plat to the City.

B. Upon the request of the owner or owners of a legal lot or lots subject to a recorded binding site plan, the Director shall rescind all or a portion of a binding site plan; provided, that any portion of a binding site plan that is rescinded shall be considered to be one lot unless divided by an approved subdivision or short division.

C. Signatures of owners of portions of a binding site plan that are not altered by an amendment(s) or rescission are not required on the amended binding site plan or application for rescission. 

(Ord. 500 § 1, 2007; Ord. 61 § 1, 1995. Formerly 21.18.070).


21.50.070 Plat vacations.

A. Vacations. When the vacation requested is specifically for a street, the procedures for street vacation in Chapter 13.15 UPMC shall be utilized. When the request is for the vacation of the plat together with the streets, the procedure for vacation in this section shall be used. Vacations of streets may not be made that are prohibited under RCW 35.79.030 and 36.87.130.

B. Submittal Requirements. Whenever any person is interested in the vacation of any subdivision or portion thereof, or any area designated or dedicated for public use, that person shall file an application for vacation with the City and pay an application fee. 

C. The application shall set forth the reasons for vacation and shall contain signatures of all parties having an ownership interest in that portion of the subdivision subject to vacation. If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants that were filed at the time of the approval of the subdivision, and the application for vacation would result in the violation of a covenant, the application shall contain an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the vacation of the subdivision or portion thereof. 

D. Notice. Notice shall be provided to all owners within the subdivision and in accordance with UPMC 21.25.040. 

E. Public Hearing. The Hearings Examiner shall hold a public hearing on the vacation in accordance with UPMC Title 22 and may approve or deny the application for vacation of the subdivision after determining the public use and interest to be served by the vacation of the subdivision. 

F. Dedications. If any portion of the land contained in the subdivision was dedicated to the public for public use or benefit, such land, if not deeded to the City, shall be deeded to the City, town, or county unless the City sets forth findings that the public use would not be served in retaining title to those lands.

G. Title. Title to the vacated property shall vest with the rightful owner as shown in the county records. If the vacated land is land that was dedicated to the public, for public use other than a road or street, and the City has found that retaining title to the land is not in the public interest, title thereto shall vest with the person or persons owning the property on each side thereof, as determined by the City. 

When the road or street that is to be vacated is contained wholly within the subdivision and is part of the boundary of the subdivision, title to the vacated road or street shall vest with the owner or owners of property contained within the vacated subdivision.

Any land division may be subject to the following improvement requirements to accomplish the purpose of this chapter and the requirements of Chapter 58.17 RCW: All improvements including but not limited to streets, bridges, drains, culverts and related structures, and facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with City standards.

A. Parks and Open Space. In new residential land divisions of 10 or more lots, a minimum of seven percent of the property shall be set aside as an open space or park area. This area shall be improved, landscaped, and include recreational equipment such as but not limited to a big toy, sport court, picnic area, and/or provide trail connections. The open space or park area shall be in a relatively flat area suitable for recreational activity and outside any critical areas such as steep slopes and wetlands. The location of the open space or park area shall be convenient to residents in the development.

B. Potable Water. Each building lot approved subject to this chapter shall be served by an approved water system. The water system shall be adequate to serve the domestic water needs of future residents of the land division.

D. Stormwater. The City shall, as a condition of approval of any land division, require the developer to construct storm drainage facilities in conformance with the City’s public works code.

E. Sanitary Sewers.

1. All new subdivisions creating five or more lots shall hook up to sanitary sewers.

2. Short plats, binding site plans and plat amendments creating four or fewer lots shall hook up to sanitary sewers if sewer lines are located within 300 feet of the development. In those cases where sewer lines are not located within 300 feet of the development, the City may permit such development to use interim septic on-site systems and dry sewer facilities.

3. A sanitary sewer system shall be considered available when the boundary of the land division is within the specified distance from the sewer line by way of a public right-of-way or private utility easement between the boundary of the land division and the existing sewer line.

4. If the sanitary sewer system is not available or if an exception has been granted, the Director may approve an interim on-site septic system subject to the following conditions:

a. A note shall be placed on the short plat or binding site plan indicating that connection shall be required at such time as the system becomes available.

b. A title notification shall be recorded stating:

At such time as sanitary sewer becomes available as defined in the University Place Municipal Code, the property owner shall be required to hook up to the sewer line in accordance with the provisions of the University Place Municipal Code.

c. A no protest to the formation of any future ULID for extension of a sewer system that would serve the property shall be recorded on the property.

d. The developer shall install dry sewer facilities.

e. The use of interim on-site septic systems does not apply to subdivisions of five or more lots.

F. Streets and Access. All land divisions shall be served by a public or private street or driveway. Such streets and driveways shall be provided and constructed in compliance with UPMC Title 13, Public Works Code. All new residential lots shall access off internal plat, short plat, or binding site plan roads, except as authorized by the Director.

G. Street Frontage Improvements. All plats, short plats, and binding site plans shall install street frontage improvements at the time of construction as required by the City’s public works code (UPMC Title 13). Frontage improvements along exterior streets shall be constructed and approved prior to issuance of building permits. Such improvements shall include curb and gutter, sidewalk, bus stops, street storm drainage, street lighting system, traffic signal modification, relocation or installation, utility relocation, landscaping and irrigation, and street widening all per the code. Plans shall be prepared and signed by a licensed civil engineer registered in the State of Washington. All frontage improvements shall be made across full frontage of property from the centerline of the constructed street facility to the outside limit of the improvements. Additional right-of-way may be required for frontage improvements.

H. Access to Shorelines. Short subdivisions, subdivisions, and binding site plans containing land adjacent to publicly owned or controlled bodies of water shall include a dedication of at least one public access to, around, or beside such bodies of water unless the Examiner or Director determines the public use and interest will not be served thereby. Such dedications shall be of a size and nature as determined by the Examiner or Director and shall be established when the plat, short plat, or binding site plan is approved.

I. Trails. Short subdivisions, subdivisions, and binding site plans located along or adjacent to a trail corridor identified in the comprehensive plan or parks, recreation, and open space plan shall provide a public pedestrian easement to extend the trail along its planned alignment and provide a trail from an internal or abutting roadway to the trail.

J. Common Areas and Facilities. Common areas and facilities shall conform to the following:

1. Facilities benefiting more than one property owner shall be considered common area/facilities, designated by easement or separate tract, and corresponding dedication statements included on the face of the final plat specifying the use for which the easement or tract is created, and assigning ownership and use interest;

2. Common areas/facilities that primarily benefit the residents/property owners within the development such as entrance signage, landscape treatment, open space, fences, and private parks and recreation facilities shall be considered “private” common areas/facilities and the primary ownership and responsibility for maintenance assigned to said residents/property owners;

3. All private common areas shall be of a size sufficient to accommodate associated facilities;

4. Adequate provisions for ownership and maintenance in the form of statements of easement; conditions, covenants and restrictions; and/or creation of a homeowner’s association shall be specified at the time of platting. The documents shall address continued ownership interest, right of use, responsibility for maintenance, remedies in the event any of the responsible parties fail to perform, and procedures for modification or vacation of easements or tracts and associated facilities not required as a condition of plat approval. The documents shall also include an adequate funding mechanism for those areas/facilities requiring regular maintenance; and

5. Common areas/facilities that are determined by the City to primarily benefit the general public or are considered part of a City facility such as storm water detention/retention ponds and bioswales shall be delineated as a separate tract and may be dedicated to the public for future ownership and maintenance at the City’s discretion.

K. Undergrounding of Utilities. All new or replacement of existing overhead utilities such as telephone, power, cable TV, etc., designed to serve the subdivision and located within the boundaries of the tract shall be installed underground. Undergrounding of existing telephone, power distribution, and cable TV lines may be exempt from this requirement if the cost of undergrounding the existing line is more than twice the cost of undergrounding service and distribution lines needed to serve the subdivision.

L. Fences and Walls. Fences and walls shall conform to the following:

1. Fences and walls shall not encroach into any street right-of-way, and shall be set back a minimum of one foot from the edges of any sidewalk;

2. Fences and walls shall comply with all clear vision area requirements at street and driveway intersections;

5. Materials. Fences shall be constructed of wood, wrought iron, brick, stone or split face concrete block (CMU). When using CMU the split face side must be visible to the public. Other materials which have the general appearance and visual quality of approved fence materials may be approved by the Director. However, the use of plywood or composition sheeting as a fence material is not permitted. Fences shall not be made of chain link except to enclose a storm water or utility facility in which case only black, dark brown or other dark-toned, vinyl-coated chain link is permitted;

6. Barbed, razor wire fences and electrified fences are prohibited.

21.55.030 Critical areas.

A. Flood or Geological Hazard. If any portion of the land where structures will be permitted within the boundaries of a land division, whether a plat, short plat, or binding site plan is subject to flood or geological hazard, the Examiner or Director may disapprove the land division or that portion of the land division so affected. In making such decision, the Examiner or Director shall use the most recent National Flood Insurance Program, Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) for Pierce County, Washington, or other authoritative data. Alternatively, the Examiner or Director may require protective improvements to be constructed as a condition of approval. 

B. If any portion of a land division is subject to flood or geological hazard, such area shall be clearly shown on the plat, short plat, or binding site plan by a prominent note on each sheet of such map whereon any portion is shown. 

C. No land division shall be approved by the Examiner or Director that is situated wholly or partially within a flood control zone as provided in Chapter 86.16 RCW without the prior written approval of the Department of Ecology.

(Ord. 500 § 1, 2007).


21.55.040 Dedications.

21.55.060 Financial guarantees.

The City, in lieu of actual construction of any improvement, except street frontage improvements, by the developer of any formal subdivision, short subdivision, or binding site plan, shall require a performance guarantee in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it or other secure methods acceptable to the City providing for and securing to the City, the actual construction and installation of such improvements within a two-year period. All improvements such as structures, streets, frontage improvements, and storm water facilities shall be designed and the construction certified by, or under the supervision of, a registered civil engineer prior to the acceptance of such improvements.

The developer shall be responsible for correcting any defect in an improvement for a period of 24 months after acceptance by the Director.

Prior to releasing the performance guarantee, the City shall require a maintenance guarantee sufficient to correct any defect in a dedicated improvement caused by faulty design, construction, or other reason as determined by the Director. Said performance guarantee shall be in compliance with UPMC Title 13 or Title 19 depending on the type of improvement.

(Ord. 500 § 1, 2007; Ord. 150 § 9, 1997; Ord. 61 § 1, 1995. Formerly 21.14.040).


21.55.070 Model homes.

Up to four detached or attached dwellings within a preliminary subdivision that has been approved in accordance with all existing plans and regulations may be constructed prior to final plat approval.

Chapter 21.60 BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENTS

Sections:

21.60.010    Purpose.

21.60.020    Scope.

21.60.030    Application.

21.60.035    Processing.

21.60.040    Administrative review.


21.60.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to clearly delineate the criteria used by City departments to review boundary line adjustments. Boundary line adjustments provide a procedure for minor or insignificant changes in property lines. This chapter is also intended to ensure compliance with the Survey Recording Act. 

(Ord. 500 § 1, 2007; Ord. 61 § 1, 1995. Formerly 21.20.010).


21.60.020 Scope.

The boundary lines separating two or more platted or unplatted lots of record may only be adjusted under the provisions of this chapter. Extinguishing such lot lines is not a boundary line adjustment subject to the requirements of this chapter. Actions that change or impair conditions or requirements imposed by previous land division decisions must be accomplished pursuant to this chapter.

A boundary line adjustment is intended to apply to minor boundary changes, to correct a controversy regarding the location of a boundary line, or to remedy adverse topographical features. A boundary line adjustment does not apply to boundary changes that would result in increased development or density otherwise regulated by applicable City land use codes and regulations, or to actions requiring replat, amendment, alteration, or vacation of a plat or short subdivision. Boundary line adjustments shall not:

A. Create any additional lot, tract, parcel, site, or division;

B. Result in a lot, tract, parcel, site, or division that contains increased density or insufficient area or dimension to meet the minimum requirements for area and dimension as set forth in the land use and health codes and regulations. This provision shall not be construed to require correction or remedy of pre-existing nonconformities or substandard conditions;

C. Diminish or impair drainage, water supply, existing sanitary sewage disposal, and access or easement for vehicles, utilities, and fire protection for any lot, tract, parcel, site, or division;

D. Create or diminish any easement or deprive any parcel of access or utilities;

E. Increase the nonconforming aspects of an existing nonconforming lot or create a nonconforming lot from a conforming one;

F. Replat, alter (except as provided in RCW 58.17.140), or vacate a plat or short subdivision; or

G. Amend the conditions of approval for previously platted property.

(Ord. 500 § 1, 2007; Ord. 150 § 12, 1997; Ord. 61 § 1, 1995. Formerly 21.20.020).


21.60.030 Application.

A. See Appendices A and B for boundary line adjustment application submittal requirements. A complete application shall be submitted to the Department using forms provided by the Department together with a filing fee.

B. Record of Survey for Boundary Line Adjustments.

1. The boundary line adjustment shall be submitted on a reproducible medium such as Mylar and shall be titled on the top of the page, in large capital letters, as follows:

RECORD OF SURVEY FOR BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENT

2. A note shall be placed on the Mylar that reads as follows:

THIS BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENT IS NOT A PLAT, REPLAT, OR SUBDIVISION.

APPROVAL OF A BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENT IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT FUTURE PERMITS WILL BE GRANTED FOR ANY STRUCTURE OR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN A LOT AFFECTED BY A BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENT.

3. All requirements of Chapter 58.09 RCW and Chapter 332-130 WAC governing minimum standards for land boundary surveys shall be met and a note shall be placed on the Mylar that reads as follows:

THIS SURVEY COMPLIES WITH ALL STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES OF THE “SURVEY RECORDING ACT” CHAPTER 58.09 RCW AND CHAPTER 332-130 WAC. 

C. Boundary line adjustment applications shall be submitted to the Department with a preliminary title report on forms approved by the Department, with liability for errors not to exceed the value of the affected lots, as determined by the assessed value on the date of approval. The preliminary title report shall set forth all persons having an interest in the lots affected by the boundary line adjustment. The preliminary title report must be dated no more than 30 days prior to application without cost to the City.

D. The Mylar for recording in the auditor’s office shall contain all survey information required for a record of survey under the “Survey Recording Act,” Chapter 58.09 RCW and Chapter 332-130 WAC, together with the following additional signature blocks, which shall be fully executed before approval:

c. Infrastructure, including public facilities and services needed to serve the development; and

d. The characteristics of the development, such as development standards and guidelines.

C. Time Limitations.

1. Within 28 days after receiving a project permit application, the Department shall provide a written determination to the applicant, stating either:

a. The application is complete; or

b. The application is incomplete and what information is necessary to make the application complete.

3. An application shall be deemed complete if the Department does not, within 28 days, provide a written determination to the applicant that the application is incomplete.

4. When the project permit is complete, the Department shall accept it and note the date of acceptance.

5. An application is complete for purposes of this section when it meets the procedural submission requirements of the Department and is sufficient for continued processing even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequently. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the Department from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the notice of completeness or subsequently if new information is required or substantial changes in the proposed action occur.

D. Initiation of Review Process. The Department shall not start the review process of any application until the application is deemed complete.

E. Incomplete Applications.

If all additional information identified in the notice of incomplete application has not been received by the Department within 120 days from the application submittal date, then the application shall be deemed null and void unless the applicant has been granted a time period extension. Time period extensions may be granted by the Director when applicants can demonstrate that unusual circumstances, beyond their control, have prevented them from being able to provide the additional information within the 120-day time period.

F. Waiver of Requirements. The Director may waive specific submittal requirements that are determined to be unnecessary for review of an application.

G. Modifications. Proposed modifications to an application which has been deemed complete by the Department will be treated as follows:

1. Modifications proposed by the Department to a pending application shall not be considered a new application; and

2. Modifications proposed by the applicant to a pending application which would result in a substantial increase in a project’s impacts, as determined by the Department, may be deemed a new application. The new application shall conform to the requirements of this section which are in effect at the time the new application is submitted.

H. Filing Fees. The schedule of fees for development permits is established in a separate City resolution.

I. Additional Application Requirements. In the interest of public health, safety or welfare, or to meet the requirements of the State Environmental Policy Act or other State requirements, the Department may request additional application information such as, but not limited to, geotechnical studies, hydrologic studies, noise studies, air quality studies, visual analysis and transportation impact studies.

22.05.090 Consistency with development regulations and SEPA/consolidated permit review.

A. During any project permit application review, the City shall determine whether the items in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project. In the absence of development regulations, the City shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the City’s adopted comprehensive plan. This determination of consistency shall include the following:

1. The type of land use permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under special circumstances, if the criteria for the approval have been satisfied;

2. The level of development, such as density of residential development, floor area ratios, or maximum floor areas; and

3. Character of the development and development standards.

B. The City shall also review the project permit application under the requirements of the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), Chapter 43.21C RCW, the SEPA rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC and the City environmental regulations, Chapter 17.40 UPMC, and shall:

1. Determine whether the applicable regulations require studies that adequately analyze all of the project permit application’s specific probable adverse environmental impacts;

2. Determine if the applicable regulations require measures that adequately address such environmental impacts;

3. Determine whether additional studies are required and/or whether the project permit application should be conditioned with additional mitigation measures; and

4. Provide prompt and coordinated review by governmental agencies and the public on compliance with applicable environmental laws and plans, including mitigation for specific project impacts that have not been considered and addressed at the plan and development regulations level.

C. In its review of the project permit application, the City may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures in the applicable development regulations, comprehensive plan, and or other applicable local, State, or Federal laws provide adequate analysis of, and mitigation for, specific adverse environmental impacts of the application.

D. A comprehensive plan, development regulation or other applicable local, State, or Federal law provides adequate analysis of, and mitigation for, the specific adverse environmental impact of an application when:

1. The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; or

2. The City has designated or accepted certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards, or other land use planning required or allowed by Chapter 36.70A RCW.

E. If the City bases or conditions its approval of the project permit application on compliance with the requirements or mitigation described in subsection (B) of this section, the City shall not impose additional mitigation under SEPA during project review.

F. In its decision whether the specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or laws of another agency with jurisdiction and with environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the City shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. In making a deferral, the City shall base or condition its project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws.

G. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the City in its review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analysis and requirements under other laws as provided by Chapter 43.21C RCW.

H. The City shall also review the application under Chapter 17.40 UPMC.

I. During project review, the City shall not re-examine alternatives to, or hear appeals on, the items identified in subsection (A) of this section, except for issues of code interpretation. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of the development, such as details or site plans, curb cuts, drainage swells, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a proposal’s probable adverse environmental impacts.

J. Within the Chambers Creek Properties overlay (CCPO) the County and City will act as joint co-lead agencies for determining SEPA compliance and mitigation for projects covered by the master site plan. When the majority of the project (i.e., largest land area) is located within the City, then the City shall be the nominal lead agency for SEPA. As nominal lead agency, the City will be responsible for coordinating SEPA review with the other parties and any other appropriate agency or entity for the issuance of threshold determinations and conducting subsequent environmental review. The City will also be responsible for ensuring compliance with environmental review notification procedures.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017; Ord, 636 § 3 (Exh. B), 2014; Ord. 236 § 6, 1999; Ord. 130 § 1, 1996).


22.05.100 Exemptions from project permit application processing.

A. Whenever a permit or approval in this code has been designated as a Type I, Type II or Type III permit, the procedures in this title shall be followed in project permit processing. The following permits or approvals are, however, specifically excluded from the procedures set forth in this title:

1. Landmark designations;

2. Street vacations;

3. Street use permits;

4. Legislative decisions, including zoning code text and area wide zoning district amendments, adoption of development regulations and amendments, area wide rezones to implement new City policies, adoption of comprehensive plan and plan amendments, development agreements associated with legislative decisions, and annexations; and

5. Final plat approval pursuant to RCW 58.17.170.

B. Pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140(2), Type I and Type II project permits that are categorically exempt from environmental review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) or for which environmental review has been completed in connection with other project permits, except short plats, are exempt from the following procedures:

1. Determination of completeness;

2. Notice of application;

3. Optional consolidated project permit review processing;

4. Joint public hearings;

5. Single staff report stating all the decisions and recommendations made as of the date of the report that do not require an open record hearing;

6. Notice of decision; and

7. Time periods.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.05.110 Optional consolidated permit processing.

A. An application that involves two or more procedures may be processed collectively under the highest type review procedure required for any part of the application or processed individually under each of the procedures identified in this title. The applicant shall determine whether the application shall be processed collectively or individually. If the applications are processed under the individual procedure option, the highest numbered type procedure must be processed prior to the subsequent lower numbered procedure. [RCW 36.70B.060(3) and 36.70B.120.]

B. Within the Chambers Creek properties overlay (CCPO), if an application involves property that is located within more than one jurisdiction, the jurisdiction with the majority of the property will be responsible for permitting functions including coordinating and receiving review comments from the other parties. For those applications requiring review and approval of a hearing examiner, one joint hearing will be held with a single examiner presiding. The jurisdictions shall mutually agree upon which hearing examiner will preside.

(Ord. 636 § 3 (Exh. B), 2014; Ord. 236 § 6, 1999; Ord. 130 § 1, 1996).


22.05.120 Appeals of administrative decisions.

A. Time Limit. Appeals may be taken to the Examiner by any aggrieved person or by any officer, department, board or commission of the City affected by a decision of an administrative official in the administration of enforcement of this code. Such appeals shall be filed in writing on forms available at the City in duplicate with the Planning and Development Services Department within 14 days of the date of the action being appealed. Appeals must be accompanied by a fee set by a separate fee resolution.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017; Ord. 423 § 102, 2004; Ord. 236 § 6, 1999; Ord. 130 § 1, 1996).

22.20.010 General.

The city of University Place is required by Chapter 36.70A RCW to ensure that applicable public improvements to accommodate the impacts of development are made concurrent with the development. This chapter implements the goals and policies of the capital facilities plan element of the University Place comprehensive plan.

(Ord. 420 § 1, 2004; Ord. 263 § 1, 2000).


22.20.020 Purpose.

To establish a concurrency management system that ensures adequate facilities for transportation, stormwater, sanitary sewer, and water are available simultaneously with, or within a reasonable time after, occupancy or use of any new development within the city.

(Ord. 420 § 1, 2004; Ord. 263 § 1, 2000).


22.20.030 Definitions.

“Applicant” means a person or entity that has applied for a development permit.

“Concurrency test” means an evaluation of the transportation, stormwater, sanitary sewer, and water facilities impacts of a proposed development and a determination whether the proposed development will cause any of those facilities to drop below the city’s adopted minimum level of service standards.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, buildings or structures, placement of manufactured homes/mobile homes, mining, dredging, clearing, filling, grading, stockpiling, paving, excavation, drilling or the subdivision of property. 

“Development permit” means a land use, site development, or building permit, or other permit issued by the city authorizing the improvement or development of property. 

“Director” means the city of University Place community development director or duly authorized representative.

“Level of service” means an established minimum capacity of public facilities or services that must be provided per unit of demand or other appropriate measure of need.

“Transportation level of service standard” means a measure which describes the operational condition of the transportation network. The transportation level of service standard may be expressed in terms such as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience, geographic accessibility and safety.

(Ord. 420 § 1, 2004; Ord. 263 § 1, 2000).


22.20.040 Level of service standards.

A. Incorporated by reference are the level of service standards identified in the capital facilities element of the city’s comprehensive plan. 

B. Meeting Level of Service Standards.

1. The transportation level of service standard will be considered met if the proposal for development fully conforms to Chapter 13.20 UPMC. 

2. The storm drainage level of service standard will be considered met if the proposal for development fully conforms to Chapter 13.25 UPMC. 

3. The water level of service standard will be considered met if the city determines that there is sufficient capacity in the water utility provider’s water system to fully serve the development. 

4. The sanitary sewer level of service standard will be considered met if the city determines that there is sufficient transmission and treatment capacity in the sewer utility provider’s sanitary sewer system to fully serve the development or if the Tacoma-Pierce County health department has approved a septic system to serve the development. 

(Ord. 420 § 1, 2004; Ord. 263 § 1, 2000).


22.20.050 Concurrency test. 

A. Procedures. The need for a concurrency test is triggered by an application for any of the development permits identified in subsection (B) of this section. The concurrency test shall be performed prior to the issuance of the triggering development permit. The applicant is responsible to provide documentation sufficient for the director to accurately perform the evaluation. UPMC Title 13 identifies the documentation requirements for transportation and stormwater facilities. For water facilities, required documentation may be of a certificate of availability from Tacoma Public Utilities. For sewer facilities, required documentation may be a copy of the sewer permit application filed with Pierce County Utilities or other sewer utility provider, or a copy of the sewer permit issued by Pierce County Utilities or other sewer utility provider, or a septic system approval from the Tacoma-Pierce County health department.

B. Triggers for Concurrency Test.

1. A concurrency test for transportation facilities is triggered by any development permit that requires a Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) as identified in UPMC Title 13 or required by SEPA.

2. A concurrency test for stormwater facilities is triggered by any development permit that requires a drainage analysis.

3. A concurrency test for water and sewer facilities is triggered by any building permit application for structures intended for human occupancy.

C. Evaluation. 

1. Permits cannot be issued for any development that does not meet the concurrency test.

2. If the evaluation shows that the facility will operate at or above the level of service standard following the completion of the development, concurrency is met. 

3. If the concurrency evaluation shows that the facility will operate below the level of service standard following the completion of the development, concurrency is not met. If concurrency is not met, the applicant may: 

a. Modify the application to reduce the impacts of the development such that the facility will operate at or above the level of service standard following the completion of the development;

b. Improve the facility such that it will operate at or above the level of service standard following the completion of the development;

c. Upon approval of the director, contribute to a programmed and funded capital project that will result in the facility operating at or above the level of service standard following the completion of the development, provided that the impacts of the development will not result in a safety hazard; or

d. Postpone development until the facility is improved by another entity such that the facility will operate at or above the level of service standard following the completion of the development.

D. Certification. 

1. Upon completion of the concurrency evaluation, the director will issue a determination of concurrency. Separate determinations of concurrency may be issued for each facility. If concurrency is met, the determination of concurrency will set forth the conditions and duration of the concurrency certification. The determination of concurrency and concurrency certification will be processed with the associated permit. 

2. For transportation concurrency, conditions shall include those set forth in an approved TIA. The duration of the transportation concurrency certification shall be for two years unless otherwise provided by law. An extension may be granted by the director upon the issuance of subsequent site development or building permits. The duration of the extension shall be for the term of the subsequent permit. 

3. For stormwater concurrency, conditions shall include those conditions set forth in the site development permit and approved storm drainage report. The duration of stormwater concurrency certification shall be for the term of the triggering development permit.

4. For water concurrency, the duration of water concurrency certification shall be for the term of the triggering development permit.

5. For sewer concurrency, the duration of the sewer concurrency certification shall be for the term of the triggering development permit.

6. A certificate of concurrency shall be revoked if the applicant fails to comply with any of the conditions of certification. 

(Ord. 420 § 1, 2004; Ord. 263 § 1, 2000).


22.20.060 Reserved capacity and volumes.

A. Transportation. The traffic volumes identified for a proposed development will be assigned to the street network at the time of concurrency certification. These traffic volumes will be assumed to be a part of the street network for the period of time set forth in the concurrency certification. Once assigned to the street network, a subsequent development proposal must incorporate these traffic volumes into any traffic analysis. Information regarding previously assigned traffic volumes can be obtained from the director. 

B. Stormwater. The surface water design standards adopted by the city require all stormwater designs to demonstrate that there will be no significant effect on any downstream stormwater systems. Reserved capacity is not applicable to a stormwater concurrency certification.

C. Sewer and Water. Capacity shall be reserved by the utilities as identified in any sewer permit or water availability determinations of the utility providers. 

(Ord. 420 § 1, 2004; Ord. 263 § 1, 2000).


22.20.070 Exemptions. 

Development permits for development that creates no measurable additional impacts on any facility are exempt from the requirements of this chapter. 

(Ord. 420 § 1, 2004; Ord. 263 § 1, 2000).


22.20.080 Administrative reconsideration and appeals.

A. The applicant may request a reconsideration of the determination of concurrency within 14 calendar days of the decision. The request for reconsideration shall be filed with the director on forms available from the city and shall specify the grounds for reconsideration. Each reconsideration request shall be accompanied by a fee as established in the development services fee resolution.

Chapter 22.25 AMENDMENTS

Sections:

22.25.010    Purpose.

22.25.020    Development regulation and zoning map amendments.

22.25.030    Legislative amendments.

22.25.040    Quasi-judicial rezones.


22.25.010 Purpose.

This title and the official zoning map may be amended whenever required by public necessity, convenience or welfare. The purpose of this chapter is to establish authority and procedure for such amendments.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.25.020 Development regulation and zoning map amendments.

A. Amendments. This chapter provides the method for amending the text and tables of the City’s development regulations and the zoning map. Development regulations include zoning, subdivision, shoreline master program, critical areas, buildings and construction, public works, and other municipal code provisions that regulate the use and development of land. Amendments to development regulation text and tables are legislative amendments. In addition, changes to the zoning map that are Citywide, area-wide, or have area-wide significance are legislative amendments. All other site-specific map amendments (or “rezones”) are quasi-judicial amendments. Legislative and quasi-judicial amendments shall be processed as provided in this chapter. Quasi-judicial rezones shall be consistent with the land use designations in the City’s comprehensive plan.

B. Rezones Versus Redesignations. A “rezone” shall mean the change of a zone classification on the City’s zoning map and is subject to the provisions of this chapter. A “redesignation” is a change of a comprehensive plan land use designation and is subject to the provisions contained in UPMC Title 16. When a proposal requires both a redesignation and a rezone, the following shall apply:

1. A redesignation and a legislative rezone may be conducted in phases or concurrently, provided final action is first taken on the redesignation.

2. A redesignation and a quasi-judicial rezone may be conducted in phases, or they may be conducted concurrently provided final action is first taken on the redesignation and further provided the applicant submits a written waiver of the deadline for issuance of a final decision of the rezone, which is 120 days from the City making a determination that a project permit application is complete.

C. Any interested person, including applicants, citizens, City Council, Planning Commission, Hearings Examiners, City staff, or staff of other agencies, may request amendments to development regulations or zoning map.

D. Application Required. For the purpose of advising and informing an applicant of the procedural requirements and to ensure that an application is in satisfactory form, the Department may encourage applicant attendance at a preapplication conference.

1. The Department shall provide the application forms and submittal requirements for amendments.

2. No amendment shall be processed until the Director determines that the information necessary to review and decide upon the amendment is complete.

3. An application fee may be required, adopted by separate resolution.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.25.030 Legislative amendments.

A. Amendments. Amendments to development regulation text and tables and rezones of area-wide significance are legislative actions and shall be considered by the City Council following review and recommendation by the Planning Commission.

B. Requests Docket. Requested legislative amendments shall be docketed and considered by the Planning Commission and City Council at least on a biannual basis, consistent with the provisions of Chapter 36.70A RCW.

C. Staff Report. The Director shall prepare a written report on each legislative amendment pending before the Planning Commission. The report shall be provided to the Planning Commission and any parties of record before the public hearing. Each report shall contain:

1. Any proposed factual findings of the City department proposing the amendment;

2. Any comments from City departments, agencies, districts and other interested parties;

3. The environmental assessment or copy of any environmental determination or final environmental impact statement; and

4. The Department’s recommendations on the amendment.

D. Public Hearing Required by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall give notice and hold at least one public hearing prior to a recommendation for adoption or amendment of any amendment. Alternatively, the Planning Commission may hold a joint public hearing with the City Council.

E. Recommendation by Planning Commission. Each determination recommending a legislative amendment shall be supported by written findings and conclusions showing the following:

1. That the proposed amendment is consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan;

2. That the proposed amendment is in the best interest of the citizens and property owners of the City;

3. That the proposed amendment enhances the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, or general welfare;

4. For rezone requests, that the proposed amendment to the zoning map is consistent with the scope and purpose of UPMC Title 19, and the description and purpose of the zone classification applied for;

5. For rezone requests, that there are sufficient changed conditions since the previous zoning became effective to warrant the proposed amendment to the zoning map;

6. For rezone requests, that the proposed amendment to the zoning map will not be materially detrimental to uses in the vicinity in which the subject property is located.

F. Adoption by the City Council. Following receipt of the Planning Commission’s recommendation, the City Council may hold additional public hearings at its discretion.

G. Should the City Council agree to an amendment to the development regulations and/or zoning map, such amendments shall be adopted by ordinance.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.25.040 Quasi-judicial rezones.

A. A quasi-judicial rezone application shall require a specific development proposal for the subject property with sufficient detail to enable the City to evaluate the applicant’s proposal for conformance with the applicable criteria and to adequately condition the rezone request to protect the public interest if appropriate. In addition, the Director may require the applicant to participate in a meeting to inform citizens about the proposal.

B. An application for a quasi-judicial rezone shall be processed in accordance with this title, Administration of Development Regulations, except that the decision of the Hearings Examiner shall not be final, but shall be a recommendation to the City Council.

C. Public Hearing. The Hearings Examiner shall hold an open record public hearing on each application. Any person may participate in the hearing by submitting written comments or making oral comments at the hearing.

D. Decision Criteria.

1. The Hearings Examiner shall recommend approval or approval with conditions or modifications if the applicant has demonstrated that the proposal complies with the decision criteria set forth in this section.

2. The applicant carries the burden of proof and must demonstrate that the criteria are met by a preponderance of the evidence.

3. If the criteria are not met, the Hearings Examiner shall recommend denial of the application.

4. Criteria. All criteria must be met in order for an application to be approved. The applicant must demonstrate the following:

a. The proposed rezone is in the best interest of the residents of the City;

b. The proposed rezone is appropriate because either:

(1) Conditions in the immediate vicinity of the subject property have so significantly changed since the property was given its present zoning that, under those changed conditions, a rezone is within the public interest; or

(2) The rezone will correct a zone classification or zone boundary that was inappropriate when established;

c. The proposed rezone is consistent with the comprehensive plan;

d. The proposed rezone is consistent with all applicable provisions of UPMC Title 19, including any specific design criteria;

e. The proposed rezone will promote, rather than detract from, the public health, safety, and welfare;

f. The site plan of the proposed project is designed to minimize all significant adverse impacts on other properties;

g. The site plan is designed to minimize impacts upon the public facilities, services and utilities;

h. The proposal is compatible with the uses and zoning of surrounding properties;

i. If applicable, that there is a means of developing, preserving, and maintaining open space; and

j. That all conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposed use can be monitored and enforced.

E. Recommendation by the Hearings Examiner. After considering all of the information submitted on the matter, the Hearings Examiner shall issue a written recommendation to the City Council setting forth the Examiner’s findings, conclusions and recommendation. The recommendation shall include the following:

1. A statement of facts presented to the Hearings Examiner that supports his or her recommendation, including facts supporting any conditions and restrictions that are recommended.

2. A statement of the Hearings Examiner’s conclusions based on those facts.

3. A statement of the criteria used by the Hearings Examiner in making the recommendation.

4. Any conditions, restrictions, and modifications that the Examiner determines are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize any undesirable effects of granting the requested rezone.

F. Distribution of Written Recommendation. The Director shall distribute copies of the recommendation of the Hearings Examiner to the applicant, each person who submitted written or oral testimony at the public hearing, and the City Council. The Director shall include a draft resolution or ordinance that embodies the Hearings Examiner’s recommendation with the copy of the recommendation sent to each City Council member.

G. City Council Action.

1. Time for Consideration. The City Council shall consider and take final action on the application at a public meeting and issue a decision within 120 days of the City making a determination that the application is complete. This time period may be extended upon written agreement of the Director and the applicant pursuant to RCW 36.70B.080(3).

2. Closed Record Hearing. The City Council review and consideration of the rezone application shall be conducted as a closed record hearing and shall be limited to the record of the hearing before the Hearings Examiner, the Hearings Examiner’s written recommendation, and comments received during the closed record hearing. No new evidence or information may be presented at the closed record hearing.

3. Argument. Persons entitled to participate in the closed record hearing are limited to parties of record in the open record hearing. Arguments made at the hearing must be limited to the information contained in the record developed by the Hearings Examiner and must specify the specific findings or conclusions disputed, if any, and the relief requested from the City Council.

4. Burden of Proof. The applicant carries the burden of proof and must demonstrate to the City Council that the decision criteria are met by a preponderance of the evidence. If the criteria are not met, the City Council shall deny the application.

5. City Council Decision. The City Council shall review the Hearings Examiner’s recommendation for compliance with the review criteria set forth in this chapter. After consideration the City Council may remand the application to the Hearings Examiner to reopen the hearing for additional evidence and supplementary findings and conclusions, or further actions as directed. If not remanded or after remand, the City Council shall, by ordinance approved by a majority of the total membership, take one of the following actions:

a. Approve the application;

b. Approve the application with modifications or conditions; or

c. Deny the application.

6. Conditions and Restrictions.

Any conditions, modifications and restrictions that are imposed shall become part of the decision.

7. Findings of Fact and Conclusions. The City Council may adopt by reference some or all of the findings and conclusions of the Hearings Examiner. The City Council shall include in the ordinance:

a. A statement of the facts that support the decision, including the facts that support any new conditions, restrictions, or modifications that are imposed;

b. A development agreement between the applicant and the City as a condition of the rezone, if warranted. Such agreement may impose development conditions designed to mitigate potential impacts of the rezone and the development;

c. The City Council’s conclusions based on its finding of facts.

8. Effect. The decision of the City Council on an application is the final decision of the City.

H. Minor Modifications. Subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance, the applicant may apply for a minor modification to a site plan approved as part of that ordinance. The Director shall review applications for a minor modification. The Director may approve a minor modification only if the Director finds that:

1. The change will not result in reducing the landscaped area, buffer areas, or the amount of open space on the project by more than five percent;

2. The change will not result in increasing the residential density;

3. The change will not result in increasing gross floor area of the project by more than five percent;

4. The change will not result in any structure, or vehicular circulation or parking area being moved more than 10 feet in any direction and will not reduce any required yard;

5. The change will not result in any increase in height of any structure;

6. The change will not result in a change in the location of any access point to the project;

7. The change will not increase any adverse impacts or undesirable effects of the project and that the change in no way significantly alters the project; and

8. The change will not modify the intent of any condition.

I. Major Modifications. If the applicant seeks a modification to the approved site plan that does not meet the requirements of a minor modification, the applicant may propose a major modification by submitting an application for a quasi-judicial project-related rezone. The City will process such application in the same manner as an application for a new quasi-judicial project-related rezone.

J. Expiration. Unless otherwise addressed in a development agreement pursuant to Chapter 22.30 UPMC:

1. The applicant must begin construction, or submit to the City a complete building permit application for the development activity, use of land, or other actions approved under this chapter, within two years after the final City decision on the matter is issued. Failure to do so shall render the City approval of the applicant’s proposal void, and the zoning of the subject property shall revert to its original zoning; provided, however, the City Council, upon a showing of good cause, may extend the time limits contained herein.

2. The applicant must substantially complete construction of the development activity, or use of land, or other actions approved under this section and complete all applicable conditions of approval within five years after the final City decision on the matter is issued. Failure to do so shall render the City approval void.

The City may enter into a development agreement with a person having ownership or control of real property within the City limits. The City may enter into a development agreement for real property outside its boundaries as part of a proposed annexation or a service agreement.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.30.020 General provisions of development agreements.

A. A development agreement must set forth the development standards and other provisions that shall apply to and govern and vest the development, use, and mitigation of the development of the real property for the duration specified in the agreement. A development agreement shall be consistent with the applicable policies and goals of the comprehensive plan and all applicable development standards adopted by the City pursuant to State law. For the purposes of this section, “development standards” includes, but is not limited to:

1. Project elements such as permitted uses, residential densities, and nonresidential densities and intensities or building sizes;

2. The amount and payment of impact fees imposed or agreed to in accordance with any applicable provisions of State law, any reimbursement provisions, other financial contributions by the property owner, inspection fees, or dedications;

8. Phasing, if applicable;

9. A build-out or vesting period for applicable standards; and

10. Any other appropriate development requirement or procedure.

B. The execution of a development agreement is a proper exercise of City police power and contract authority. A development agreement may obligate a party to fund or provide services, infrastructure, or other facilities. A development agreement shall reserve authority to impose new or different regulations to the extent required by a serious threat to public health and safety.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.30.030 Enforceability.

Unless amended or terminated, a development agreement is enforceable during its term by a party to the agreement. A development agreement and the development standards in the agreement govern during the term of the agreement, or for all or that part of the build-out period specified in the agreement. The agreement may not be subject to an amendment to a zoning ordinance or development standard or a new zoning ordinance or development standard or regulation adopted after the effective date of the agreement. The permit approval issued by the City after the execution of the agreement must be consistent with the development agreement.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.30.040 Processing procedure for development agreements.

A. Legislative Actions. A development agreement associated with a legislative action such as a comprehensive plan amendment or area-wide rezone shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established in Chapter 16.10 UPMC.

B. Project Permits. A development agreement associated with a project permit application shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established in Chapters 22.05 and 22.10 UPMC.

1. If the final decision on the underlying project permit application is made by the Hearings Examiner, then the Hearings Examiner shall consider both the project permit application and the proposed development agreement together during the public hearing. The Hearings Examiner shall make a recommendation to the Council on the development agreement and the Examiner’s decision on the underlying project permit application shall be held in abeyance until the City Council considers the proposed development agreement in a public hearing. If the City Council approves the development agreement, the Council shall, by resolution or ordinance, authorize the City Manager or designee to execute the development agreement on behalf of the City. At this point, the Hearings Examiner may then issue the final decision on the underlying project permit application. Nothing in this section obligates the Hearings Examiner to forward a recommendation to the City Council for further consideration if the Hearings Examiner denies the underlying project permit application.

2. If the final decision on the underlying project permit application is made by the City administrative staff, then City staff shall consider both the project permit application and the proposed development agreement together. City staff shall make a recommendation to the Council on the development agreement, and the City staff’s decision on the underlying project permit application shall be held in abeyance until the City Council considers the proposed development agreement in a public hearing. If the City Council approves the development agreement, the Council shall, by resolution or ordinance, authorize the City Manager or designee to execute the development agreement on behalf of the City. At this point, City staff may then issue the final decision on the underlying project permit application. Nothing in this section obligates City staff to forward a recommendation to the City Council for further consideration if City staff denies the underlying project permit application.

3. If a final decision on an underlying project permit application has been previously made by the Hearings Examiner or City administrative staff and the application was approved, City staff shall make a recommendation to the Council on the development agreement. A public hearing shall be held on the development agreement and if approved, the Council shall authorize the City Manager or designee, in a resolution or ordinance, to execute the development agreement on behalf of the City.

(Ord. 711 § 3, 2018; Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.30.050 No deadline for final decision, form of agreement, term, recordation.

A. Development agreements are not “project permit applications” as defined in State law. Therefore, there is no deadline for processing a development agreement. If an applicant requests that the City execute a development agreement as part of its approval of a project permit application, the applicant must first sign a written waiver of the deadline for issuance of a final decision of the project permit application.

B. Form. No development agreement shall be presented to the decision-making body unless in a form approved by the City Attorney. Every development agreement shall be signed by the property owner and all other parties with a substantial beneficial interest in the property that is the subject of the development agreement, prior to any public hearing held for the purpose of authorizing execution of the development agreement.

C. Term.

1. Unless a longer term is specified in the development agreement, such agreements shall have a maximum term of five years.

2. In determining the appropriate term for a development agreement, the City Council should consider the type, size and location of the development and phasing if proposed.

3. Extensions. Unless extensions are provided for in the development agreement a one-time extension for up to five years may be requested if authorized in the development agreement. If extensions are authorized in a development agreement, an applicant must request the extension at least 60 days prior to expiration. All extension requests shall be reviewed by the City Council after a public hearing on the request, unless another process is expressly provided for in the development agreement.

D. Recordation. A development agreement shall be recorded against the real property records of the Pierce County Assessor’s Office. During the term of the development agreement, the agreement is binding on the parties and their successors, including any area that is annexed to the City.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.30.060 Judicial appeal.

If the development agreement relates to a project permit application, the provisions of State law shall apply to the appeal of the decision on the development agreement.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).


22.30.070 No retroactive effect.

This chapter does not affect the validity of any development agreement, contract rezone, concomitant agreement, annexation agreement, or other agreement in existence prior to its effective date, or adopted under separate authority, which includes some or all of the development standards provided in UPMC 22.30.020.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. C), 2017).

This title may be amended from time to time, and in no event shall this title be considered a contract between the city and a franchisee such that the city would be prohibited from amending any provision hereof; provided no such amendment shall in any way impair any contract right or increase obligations of a franchisee under an outstanding and effective franchise except in the lawful exercise of the city’s police power.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.25.020 Franchise required. 

No person may construct, operate or maintain a cable television system or provide cable television service over a cable television system within the city without a franchise granted by the city authorizing such activity. No person may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the city pursuant to this title. For the purpose of this provision, the operation of part or all of a cable television system within the city means the use or occupancy of rights-of-way by facilities used to provide cable television service. A system used to provide telephone service also used to provide cable television service shall be subject to this title and shall also require a franchise. Services similar to cable television service, such as open video system service, shall be subject to this title to the extent provided by law. A system shall not be deemed as operating within the city even though service is offered or rendered to one or more subscribers within the city, if no right-of-way is used or occupied. All cable television franchises granted pursuant to this title shall contain substantially similar terms and conditions, which, taken as a whole and considering relevant characteristics of the applicants, do not provide more or less favorable terms and conditions than those required of other cable television franchisees.

Unless otherwise specified in a cable television franchise, no cable television franchise shall be granted for a period of more than 25 years.

A. A cable television franchise authorizes use of rights-of-way for installing, operating and maintaining cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit and other devices necessary and appurtenant to the operation of a cable television system to provide cable television services within the city, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize a franchisee to provide service to or install a cable system on private property without owner consent, or to use publicly or privately owned poles, ducts or conduits without a separate agreement with the owners to the extent provided by law.

B. A cable television franchise issued by the city confers the authority to provide other telecommunications services over the cable television system so long as no additional facilities are located within the right-of-way beyond those used by the cable system. Otherwise, a franchise shall not confer any implicit rights other than those mandated by federal, state or local law.

C. A cable television franchise is nonexclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable television systems within the city, affect the city’s right to authorize use of rights-of-way by other persons to operate cable television systems or for other purposes as it determines appropriate, or affect the city’s right to itself construct, operate or maintain a cable television system, with or without a franchise.

D. Once a cable television franchise has been accepted and executed by the city and a franchisee, such cable television franchise shall constitute a valid and enforceable agreement between the franchisee and the city, and the terms, conditions and provisions of such franchise, subject to this title and all other duly enacted and applicable laws and regulations, shall define the rights and obligations of the franchisee and the city relating to the franchise.

E. All privileges prescribed by a cable television franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the rights-of-way and the city reserves the right to reasonably designate where a franchisee’s facilities are to be placed within the rights-of-way through its generally applicable permit procedures.

F. A cable television franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to the original franchisee. No franchise transfer shall occur without the prior written consent of the city upon application made by the franchisee pursuant to this title, and the franchise, and applicable law, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and any purported franchise transfer made without application and prior written consent shall be void and shall be cause for the city to revoke the cable television franchise.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.25.050 Cable television franchisee subject to other laws, police powers.

A. A cable television franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, including this title. A cable television franchisee shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the city including, but not limited to, all rights the city may have under the Cable Acts, all powers regarding zoning, supervision of construction, control of rights-of-way and consumer protection.

B. The city shall have full authority to regulate cable television systems, cable television franchisees and franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully permissible.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.25.060 Interpretation of franchise terms.

A. In the event of a conflict between this title and a cable television franchise, the provisions of this title control if the conflict arises from the lawful exercise of the city’s police power.

B. The provisions of this title and a cable television franchise will be liberally construed in accordance with generally accepted rules of construction to promote the public interest.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.25.070 Operation of a cable television system without a franchise. 

Any person who occupies rights-of-way for the purpose of operating or constructing a cable television system or provides cable television service over a cable television system and who does not hold a valid franchise from the city shall be subject to all requirements of this title. In its discretion, the city at any time may by ordinance require such person to enter into a franchise within 30 days of receipt of a written notice to such person from the city that a franchise is required, require such person to remove its property and restore the affected area to a condition satisfactory to the city, direct municipal personnel to remove the property and restore the affected area to a condition satisfactory to the city and charge the person the costs thereof, including by placing a lien on the person’s property, or take any other action it is entitled to take under applicable law. In no event shall a franchise be created unless it is issued by the city pursuant to this title and subject to a written franchise agreement.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.25.080 Eminent domain. 

Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the city’s power of eminent domain.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.25.090 Cable television franchise fees.

23.45.040 Policy statement.

A. The City, with increasing frequency, has been confronted with requests to locate towers and antennas. The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: (1) enhance the ability of personal wireless service providers to provide such services throughout the City quickly, effectively, and efficiently; (2) encourage personal wireless service providers to locate towers and antenna in nonresidential areas; (3) encourage personal wireless service providers to co-locate on new and existing tower sites; (4) encourage personal wireless service providers to locate towers and antennas, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on City residents is minimal; (5) encourage personal wireless service providers to configure towers and antennas in a way that minimizes any significant adverse visual impact; and (6) provide for the wireless communications needs of governmental entities. Accordingly, the City Council finds that the promulgation of this chapter is warranted and necessary:

1. To manage the location of towers and antennas in the City;

2. To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers;

3. To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;

4. To accommodate an increased need for towers to serve the wireless communications needs of City residents;

5. To promote and encourage co-location on existing and new towers as an option rather than construction of additional single-use towers, and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future;

6. To consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent permitted by the Telecommunications Act of 1996; and

7. To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties through sound engineering practices and the proper siting of antenna support structures.

B. New Uses. All new antennas shall comply with this chapter after the date of passage.

C. Existing Uses. All towers and antennas existing on the date of passage of this chapter shall be allowed to continue as they presently exist, but will be considered nonconforming uses. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on existing towers and antennas. However, new construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers, antennas, buildings or other facilities shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.050 Application of this chapter to wireless facilities for governmental entities.

All sections of this chapter, except UPMC 23.45.060, apply to the wireless communications facilities for governmental entities.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.060 Recognition of industry site selection criteria.

In establishing a new site, the industry requires a location that is technically compatible with the established network. A general area is to be identified based upon engineering constraints and the desired area of service. Specific locations within that general area will be evaluated using the following criteria which are not listed in order of priority:

A. Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum efficiency in telephone service.

B. Availability of road access.

C. Availability of electric power.

D. Availability of land based telephone lines or microwave link capability.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.070 Site selection criteria.

A. Any applicant proposing to construct an antenna support structure, or mount an antenna on an existing structure, shall evaluate different sites to determine which site will provide the best screening and camouflaging while providing adequate service to satisfy its function in the applicant’s local grid system. If the applicant proposes a site that does not provide the best opportunities for screening and camouflaging then the applicant must demonstrate by engineering evidence why the facility cannot be located at the site where it can be best screened and camouflaged and why the the antenna must be located at the proposed site. Further, the applicant must demonstrate by engineering evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the site’s function within the grid system.

B. Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates either that it is an FCC-licensed telecommunications provider or that it has agreements with an FCC-licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure.

C. Low power mobile radio service facilities shall be located and designed to minimize any significant adverse impact on residential property values. Facilities shall be placed in locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings, or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening. 

D. In all zones, location and design of facilities shall consider the impact of the facility on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district. In all zones, towers shall be significantly screened by placing them in trees to the extent that it does not result in significant signal degradation. 

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.080 Priority of locations.

The order of priorities for locating new personal wireless service facilities shall be as follows:

A. Place antennas and towers on public property if practical.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. D), 2017; Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.110 Co-location.

To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers, co-location of personal wireless service facilities on existing or new towers is encouraged as follows:

A. Proposed facilities may, and are encouraged to, co-locate onto existing towers.

B. The conditional use permit requirement for a facility will be waived in nonresidential zones if the applicant locates the antenna on an existing structure or an existing tower unless additional height requires a conditional use permit. Any co-location must be accomplished in a manner consistent with the policy, site criteria, and landscape/screening provisions contained in this chapter.

The applicant must submit detailed plans to the Planning and Development Services Department for an administrative use permit to determine if the conditional use permit process and public hearing can be waived. No building permit will be issued until approval is granted by an administrative use permit or conditional use permit.

C. The City may deny an application to construct new facilities if the applicant has not shown by substantial evidence that it has made a diligent effort to mount the facilities on an existing structure or tower.

D. To reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the City in the future, new proposed support structures shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for technical or physical reasons.

E. Unless co-location is not feasible: (1) an applicant’s site plan shall reserve an area for other providers’ equipment near the base of the applicant’s tower. A first right-of-refusal (which is either executed or maintained while the provider’s personal wireless facilities and services are in use) to lease the area at the base of the tower or mount for other providers will meet the reservation requirement; and (2) the site plan for towers in excess of 100 feet above ground level must propose space for two comparable providers, while the site plan for towers 100 feet or less must propose space for one comparable provider.

F. All personal wireless service providers or lessees or agents thereof shall cooperate in good faith to accommodate co-location with competitors. If a dispute arises about the feasibility of co-locating, the City Manager may require a third party technical study, at the expense of either or both parties, to resolve the dispute.

G. While co-location and the requirements herein are encouraged, co-location shall not take precedence over the construction of shorter towers with appropriate screening.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. D), 2017; Ord. 423 § 111, 2004; Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.120 Design criteria.

A. As provided above, new facilities shall be designed to accommodate co-location, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical, or physical reasons.

B. Facilities shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses in the zoning district and screened or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site.

1. Setback. A tower’s setback shall be measured from the base of the tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. In R1, R2, MF-L and MF-H zones or where a proposed tower is on property abutting a residential use, towers shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to 100 percent of tower height as measured from ground level. However, if there are unusual geographical limitations or if better screening can be achieved, setbacks may be reduced at the City’s discretion. All towers shall be set back a minimum of 30 feet. When making a discretionary decision to reduce setbacks, considerations shall include by way of illustration and not limitation:

a. Impact on adjacent properties;

b. Alternative sites for personal wireless facilities; and

c. The extent to which screening and camouflaging will mitigate the effects of the personal wireless facilities.

2. Right-of-Way Setback Exception. The setback requirement is waived if the antenna and antenna support structure are located in the City right-of-way provided antenna is attached to an existing utility pole and does not increase the height of the utility pole and/or extend above the utility pole by more than 10 feet. Wireless facilities attached to utility poles are only permitted in the MU, MU-O, MU-M, NC, CC, TC and LI-BP zones subject to license or franchise agreements with the City.

3. Tower and Antenna Height. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the tower and antenna is the minimum height required to meet the proven communications need. No tower or antenna that is taller than this minimum height shall be approved. No tower or mount together with antenna shall exceed 60 feet in R1, R2, MF-L, MF-H, POS or TC zones or 110 feet in the MU, MU-O, NC, CC and LI-BP zones. Towers or mounts and antenna shall not exceed the height limits specified in UPMC 19.45.100 and 19.45.110 in the MU-M zone.

4. Tower Separation. In no case shall towers be located closer than 500 feet from another tower whether it is owned or utilized by applicant or another provider, unless the City designates areas where multiple towers can be located in closer proximity.

5. View Corridors. Due consideration shall be given so that placement of towers, antennas, and personal wireless service facilities do not obstruct or significantly diminish views from public areas of Mt. Rainier, Puget Sound or the Olympic Mountains.

6. Color. Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility, unless a different color is required by the FCC or FAA.

7. Signs. No signs, banners or similar devices or materials may be attached to the tower, antenna support structures or antennas.

8. Lights, Signals and Signs. No signals, lights, or signs shall be permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or the FAA. Should lighting be required, in cases where there are residents located within a distance that is 300 percent of the height of the tower, then dual mode lighting shall be requested from the FAA.

9. Fencing. A well-constructed wall or wooden fence not less than six feet in height from the finished grade shall be provided around each personal wireless service facility. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. The use of chain link, plastic, vinyl, or wire fencing is prohibited unless it is fully screened from public view by a minimum eight-foot-wide landscaping strip.

10. Landscaping.

a. Landscaping. Landscaping, as described herein, shall be required to buffer personal wireless service facilities as much as possible, to soften the appearance of the cell site. The City may permit any combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted flush on an existing building, and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure, landscaping shall not be required.

b. Buffers. The visual impacts of a personal wireless service facility shall be mitigated through landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary structures. The following landscaping and buffering shall be required around the perimeter of the tower and accessory structures, except that the City may waive the standards for those sides of the facility that are not in public view. Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of fences. Further, existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for or as a supplement to landscaping requirements.

(1) A row of evergreen trees a minimum of six feet tall at planting a maximum of six feet apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the fence.

(2) A continuous hedge at least 36 inches high at planting capable of growing to at least 48 inches in height within 18 months shall be planted in front of the tree line referenced above.

(3) To guarantee required landscaping the applicant shall provide the City with a 36-month landscape maintenance guarantee in accordance with UPMC 19.65.230(B).

(4) In the event that landscaping is not maintained at the required level after the 36-month landscape guarantee period, the City after giving 30 days’ advance written notice may maintain or establish the landscaping and bill both the owner and lessee for such costs until such costs are paid in full.

11. Screening. Screening, camouflaging or otherwise integrating a telecommunications facility into existing structures on the site in order to make the facility as visually unobtrusive as possible shall take priority over increased height to accommodate co-location. A personal wireless telecommunications facility shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing “character” (as defined in Chapter 19.10 UPMC) of the site so as to be visually unobtrusive or screened. To be considered screened, the tower or mount shall be placed amongst and adjacent to (within 20 feet) the drip line of three or more trees at least 75 percent of the height of the facility. To ensure the screening trees are preserved the following note shall be recorded on the property title:

All trees within 50 feet of the telecommunications facility located on this property, which serve to screen the telecommunications facility, shall be retained for the life of the telecommunications facility. Screening trees may only be removed if deemed diseased or dangerous by a certified arborist. Before any trees can be removed a report from the certified arborist shall be submitted to the City for review and approval. Unless approved by the City, only that portion of the tree required to remove the hazard can be removed.

12. Required Parking. If the cell site is fully automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the site is not automated, arrangements for adequate off-street parking shall be made and documentation thereof provided to the City. Security fencing should be colored or should be of a design which blends into the “character” (as defined in Chapter 19.10 UPMC) of the existing environment.

13. Antenna Criteria. Antenna on or above a structure shall be subject to the following:

a. The antenna shall be architecturally compatible with the building and wall on which it is mounted, and shall be designed and located so as to minimize any adverse aesthetic impact.

b. The antenna shall be mounted on a wall of an existing building in a configuration as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not project above the wall on which it is mounted unless it must be for technical reasons. In no event shall an antenna project more than 16 feet above the roof line, including parapets.

c. The antenna shall be constructed, painted, or fully screened to match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on which it is mounted.

d. The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building, but may not project any higher than the enclosure.

e. If an accessory equipment shelter is present, it must blend with the surrounding buildings in architectural character and color.

f. The antenna and any accessory buildings must be architecturally and visually (color, size, bulk) compatible with surrounding existing buildings, structures, vegetation, and uses. Such facilities will be considered architecturally and visually compatible if they are camouflaged to disguise the facility.

g. Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation should be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual mitigation techniques must be evaluated by the City, in the City’s sole discretion.

h. On buildings 30 feet or less in height, the antenna may be mounted on the roof if the following additional criteria are satisfied:

(1) The City finds that it is not technically possible or aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall.

(2) No portion of the antenna, base station or screening causes the building to exceed the maximum height allowed in the zone.

(3) Roof mounted antenna and related base stations are completely screened from view by materials that are consistent and compatible with the design, color, and materials of the building.

(4) No portion of the antenna may exceed 16 feet above the height of the existing building.

i. For antenna attached to the roof or sides of a building at least 30 feet in height, an existing tower, a water tank, or a similar structure, the antenna must be either:

(1) An omni-directional or whip antenna no more than seven inches in diameter and extending no more than 16 feet above the structure to which it is attached; or

(2) A panel antenna no more than two feet wide and six feet long, extending above the structure to which they are attached by no more than 10 feet.

(3) Antenna, antenna arrays, and support structures not on publicly owned property shall not extend more than 16 feet above the highest point of the structure on which they are mounted. The antenna, antenna array, and their support structure shall be mounted so as to blend with the structure to which the antenna is attached. The antenna and its support structure shall be designed to withstand a wind force of 100 miles per hour without the use of supporting guy wires. The antenna, antenna array, and their support structure shall be a color that blends with the structure on which they are mounted.

j. Guy Wires Restricted. No guy or other support wires shall be used in connection with such antenna, antenna array, or its support structure except when used to anchor the antenna, antenna array, or support structure to an existing building to which such antenna, antenna array, or support structure is attached.

k. If a proposed antenna is located on a building or a lot subject to a land use permit, approval is required prior to the issuance of a building permit.

l. No person shall locate an antenna or tower for wireless communications services upon any lot or parcel except as provided in this chapter.

14. Equipment Structures.

a. Ground level equipment, buildings, and the tower base shall be screened from public view. The standards for the equipment buildings are as follows:

(1) The maximum floor area is 300 square feet and the maximum height is 12 feet. Except in unusual circumstances or for other public policy considerations, the equipment building may be located no more than 250 feet from the tower or antenna. Depending upon the aesthetics and other issues, the City, in its sole discretion, may approve multiple equipment structures or one or more larger structures.

(2) Ground level buildings shall be screened from view by landscape plantings, fencing, or other appropriate means, as specified herein or in other City ordinances.

(3) In instances where equipment buildings are located in residential zones, equipment buildings shall comply with setback requirements and shall be designed so as to conform in appearance with nearby residential structures.

b. Roof Mounted. Equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar to the exterior building walls. Equipment for roof mounted antenna may also be located within the building on which the antenna is mounted.

c. Equipment buildings, antenna, and related equipment shall occupy no more than 25 percent of the total roof area of the building the facility is mounted on, which may vary in the City’s sole discretion if co-location and an adequate screening structure is used.

15. Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the Federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If those standards and regulations are changed, then personal wireless service providers governed by this chapter shall bring their towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within three months of their effective date or the timelines provided by the revised standards and regulations, whichever time period is longer. The revised standards and regulations are not retroactively applicable to existing providers, unless otherwise provided or permitted by Federal law. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the City to remove a provider’s facilities at the provider’s expense.

16. Building Codes – Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable City building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring its tower into compliance within 30 days, the City may remove the tower at the owner’s expense.

17. Structural Design. Towers shall be constructed to the EIA standards, which may be amended from time to time, and to all applicable construction/building codes. Further, any improvements or additions to existing towers shall require submission of site plans stamped by a professional engineer that demonstrate compliance with the EIA standards and all other good industry practices. The plans shall be submitted and reviewed at the time building permits are requested.

No personal wireless service provider or lessee shall fail to assure that its antenna complies at all times with the current applicable FCC RF Emission standards. After installation, but prior to putting the antenna in service, each provider shall submit a certification by an independent professional engineer to that effect. In the event that an antenna is co-located with another antenna, the certification must provide assurances that FCC approved levels of electromagnetic radiation will not be exceeded by the co-location.

18. Antenna Support Structure Safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed antenna and support structure are safe and the surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by support structure failure, falling ice, or other debris or interference. All support structures shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. D), 2017; Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.130 Permits required.

Notes:

1    Right-of-way and site development permits may also be required depending on type and location of facilities.

2    Towers must be located on nonresidential property.

3    Antenna mounted on existing antenna support structure in the LI-BP, CC, NC, MU, MU-O, MU-M and TC zone at ≤ the maximum building height allowed in the zone may be permitted following building permit review and submittal of an affidavit of compliance with this chapter and other City regulations.

B. If a wireless facility is not greater than one and one-half cubic feet in size, has two or fewer antennas that are no more than two feet in length, and is attached to an existing electric, telephone or light pole at a height no lower than 15 feet above ground in nonresidential districts of the City, then only administrative use and building permit review are required. Such a facility shall not be subject to setbacks and screening requirements.

C. A variance from the height limit may be granted if the applicant can show by evidence that the additional height is necessary to provide adequate service to the residents of the City and no other alternative is available. When granting a variance the Examiner shall require that a significant portion of the tower and related facilities be screened by existing trees or existing structures. In the City center area, a variance may only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.

1. The purpose of this subsection is to provide a means of increasing the maximum height of tower and antenna in specific instances where the strict application of those limits would deprive a tower or antenna operator from achieving the minimum height required to meet the proven communications need.

2. The Examiner shall have the authority to grant a variance from the maximum height allowed for tower or antenna when, in his/her opinion, the conditions as set forth in subsection (C)(3) of this section have been found to exist. In such cases a variance may be granted which is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter.

3. Before a height variance can be granted, it shall be shown that the applicant demonstrates all of the following:

a. That there is evidence that additional height is required to provide adequate service to the residents of the City and that no other alternative is available;

b. That there are special circumstances applicable to the subject property such as shape, topography, location, or surroundings that prevent the operator from achieving the minimum height required to meet the proven communications need;

c. That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity;

d. That any visual impacts will be mitigated to the greatest extent possible using camouflage or screening, including but not limited to strategic placement next to existing buildings or vegetation or incorporation with architectural features of existing buildings or structures;

e. That the location of the tower and antenna has been chosen so as to minimize the visibility of the facility from residentially zoned land and to minimize the obstruction of scenic views from public properties; and

f. That the variance is the minimum necessary to grant relief to the applicant.

4. The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed variance meets all of the criteria in subsection (C)(3) of this section, decision criteria.

5. The Examiner may approve an application for a variance with additional requirements above those specified in this title or require modification of the proposal to comply with specified requirements or local conditions.

6. The Examiner shall deny a variance if the proposal does not meet or cannot be conditioned or modified to meet subsection (C)(3) of this section.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. D), 2017; Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.140 Inspection requirements.

Each year after a facility becomes operational, the facility operator shall conduct a safety inspection in accordance with the EIA and FCC standards and within 60 days of the inspection file a report with the City. Submission of a copy of FCC required, and duly filed, safety inspection report, or the facility operator’s maintenance reports for the prior 12 months in the event no FCC report is required for such year, shall satisfy the requirements of this section. 

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.160 Non-use/abandonment.

A. Abandonment. No less than 30 days prior to the date that a personal wireless service provider plans to abandon or discontinue operation of a facility, the provider must notify the City of University Place by certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operation. In the event that a licensed carrier fails to give notice, the facility shall be considered abandoned upon the City’s discovery of discontinuation of operation. Upon such abandonment, the provider shall have 60 days or additional period of time determined in the reasonable discretion of the City within which to:

1. Reactivate the use of the facility or transfer the facility to another provider who makes actual use of the facility; or

2. In the event that abandonment as defined in this chapter occurs due to relocation of an antenna at a lower point on the antenna support structure, reduction in the effective radiated power of the antenna or reduction in the number of transmissions from the antennas, the operator of the tower shall have six months from the date of effective abandonment to co-locate another service on the tower. If another service provider is not added to the tower, then the operator shall promptly dismantle and remove the portion of the tower that exceeds the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes which are made to personal wireless facilities which do not diminish their essential role in providing a total system shall not constitute abandonment. However, in the event that there is a physical reduction in height of substantially all of the provider’s towers in the City or surrounding area then all of the towers within the City shall similarly be reduced in height.

3. Dismantle and remove facility. If the tower, antenna, foundation, and facility are not removed within the 60-day time period or additional period of time allowed by the City, the City may remove such tower, antenna, foundation, and related facility at the provider’s expense. If there are two or more providers co-locating on a facility, except as provided for in the paragraph above, this provision shall not become effective until all providers cease using the facility. 

B. At the earlier of 60 days from the date of abandonment without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and removal, City approval for the facility shall automatically expire.

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.170 Third party review.

A. Personal wireless service providers use various methodologies and analyses, including geographically based computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of their services and low power mobile radio service facilities, such as expected coverage area, antenna configuration, topographic constraints that affect signal paths, etc. In certain instances, a third party expert may need to review the technical data submitted by a provider. The City may require a technical review as part of a permitting process. The costs of the technical review shall be borne by the provider. 

B. The selection of the third party expert may be by mutual agreement between the provider and the City, or, at the discretion of the City, with a provision for the provider and interested parties to comment on the proposed expert and review its qualifications. The expert review is intended to address interference and public safety issues and be a site-specific review of technical aspects of the facilities or a review of the provider’s methodology and equipment used and not a subjective review of the site that was selected by a provider. Based on the results of the expert review, the City may require changes to the provider’s application. The expert review shall address the following:

1. The accuracy and completeness of submissions;

2. The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;

3. The validity of conclusions reached; and

4. Any specific technical issues designated by the City. 

(Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).


23.45.180 Penalties and enforcement.

A. Criminal Penalties. Any person, association, firm, partnership, or corporation that violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be penalized as provided in Chapter 1.15 UPMC.

B. Civil Penalties. In addition to any criminal penalties, any person who fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty in accordance with Chapter 1.15 UPMC.

C. Other Legal Remedies. Nothing in this chapter limits the right of the City to pursue other lawful, criminal, civil or equitable remedies to abate, discontinue, correct or discourage unlawful acts under or in violation of this chapter.

D. Enforcement action by the City shall be in accordance with Chapter 1.20 and/or 1.30 UPMC for enforcement procedures and penalties.

(Ord. 688 § 1 (Exhs. D, E), 2017; Ord. 360 § 1, 2002).
