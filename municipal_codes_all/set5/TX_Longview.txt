The municipal government provided by this Charter shall be known as the

only to the limitations imposed by the state constitution and by this Charter

City Manager, who shall execute the laws and administer the government of the
city.
Section 1.03.  Powers of the city.

constitution and laws of this state, as fully and completely as though they
were specifically enumerated in this Charter. All such powers, whether
expressed or implied, shall be exercised and enforced in the manner prescribed
by this Charter, and, when not prescribed herein, in such manner as may be
provided by ordinance or resolution of the Council of the City of Longview.
The enumeration of particular powers in this Charter shall not be held or
deemed to be exclusive, but in addition to the powers enumerated herein,
implied thereby or appropriate to the exercise thereof, the city may have and
shall exercise all other powers which, under the constitution of the State of
Texas, it would be competent for the Charter specifically to enumerate. The
City of Longview shall have and exercise all the powers conferred upon cities
by what is known as the home rule amendment to the Constitution of the State of
Texas and the enabling act and all other laws passed or which may hereafter be
passed by the legislature in relation to such matters.
The City of Longview may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its
functions, and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in

hundred (100) residents may be disannexed by the City Council, when the City
Council determines that such disannexation is for the best interests of the
city. The City Council, after hearing the arguments for and against such
proposed disannexation, may grant or deny the request; refunds as to taxes and
fees shall be in accordance with Chapter 43 of the Texas Local Government Code,
as amended, or as otherwise specified by state law.

of his findings. The City Secretary shall then notify the Council of the
results of his examination at its next regular meeting.

days after the notification of the insufficiency has been sent by the City
Secretary, by filing of a supplementary petition upon additional papers signed
and filed as provided in case of an original petition. The City Secretary
shall, within five (5) days after such an amendment is filed, make examination
of the amended petition, and, if the petition be still insufficient, he shall
file his certificate to that effect in his office, and notify the committee of
petitioners of his findings, and no further action shall be had on such
insufficient petition. The finding of the insufficiency of a petition shall not
prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose.
When a referendum petition, or amended petition as defined above, has been
certified as sufficient by the City Secretary, the ordinance specified in the
petition shall not go into effect, or further action thereunder shall be
suspended if it shall have gone into effect, until and unless approved by the
voters, as hereinafter provided.
Section 14.06.  Council consideration and submission to voters.
Whenever the Council receives a certified initiative or referendum petition
from the City Secretary, it shall proceed at once to consider such petition. A
proposed initiative ordinance shall be read, and provision shall be made for a
public hearing upon the proposed ordinance. The Council shall take final action
on the ordinance not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which such

proposed or referred ordinance shall be submitted to the voters on one of the
uniform election dates as specified in the V.T.C.A., Election Code, as amended

the legal title of any such initiated or referred ordinance and shall be a
clear, concise statement, without argument or prejudice, descriptive of the
substance of such ordinance and if a paper ballot is used, it shall have below
the ballot title the following propositions, one above the other in the order
indicated: "FOR THE ORDINANCE" and "AGAINST THE ORDINANCE," Any number of
ordinances may be voted on at the same election, and may be submitted on the
same ballot, but any paper ballot used for voting on an initiated or referred
ordinance or ordinances shall be for that purpose only. If voting machines are
used, the ballot title of any ordinance shall have below it the same two (2)
propositions, one above the other or one preceding the other in the order
indicated, and the voter shall be given an opportunity to vote for either of
the two (2) propositions and thereby to vote for or against the ordinance.
Section 14.07.  Referendum petitions; suspension of effect of ordinances.
When a referendum petition is filed with the City Secretary, the ordinance
sought to be reconsidered shall be suspended from taking effect. Such
suspension shall terminate when:

   (d)   thirty (30) days have elapsed after a vote for repeal of the ordinance
has failed.
Section 14.08.  Results of referendum elections.
If a majority of the voters voting on a proposed initiative ordinance shall
vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon be an ordinance of the city. A
referred ordinance which is not approved by a majority of the voters voting
thereon shall thereupon be deemed repealed. If the conflicting ordinances are
approved by the voters at the same election, the one receiving the greatest
number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.

currently qualified voters of the district served by such Councilman equal in
number to at least twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of currently
qualified voters registered to vote at the last regular municipal election in
such district demanding the removal of such elected officer. If the petition is
certified by the City Secretary to be sufficient, the Council shall order and
hold an election forthwith to determine whether such officer shall be recalled,
and if the majority of the legal votes are cast for a recall of the officer
named on the ballot, the Council shall immediately declare his office vacant,

City Secretary's certificate to that effect, and notify the officer sought to
be recalled of such action. To be valid, a petition submitted for the purpose
of complying with a recall election process shall comply with the V.T.C.A.,
Election code, as amended. If the officer whose removal is sought does not
resign within five (5) days after such notice, the City Council shall thereupon
order and fix a date for holding a recall election. Any such election shall be
held not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days after the
petition has been presented to the City Council or after the public hearing
provided in section 14.10 is held, if such hearing is requested, at the same
time as any municipal election held within such period; but if no such
municipal election be held within such period, the City Council shall call a
special election to be held within the time aforesaid.
All qualified voters of the city shall be entitled to cast ballots in a recall
election of the Councilman elected at large and all qualified voters in the
district in which a recall election for a Councilman elected from the district
shall be entitled to cast ballots in the recall election in that district.
Ballots used at recall elections shall conform to the following requirements:

(1)   To work for city only. Persons so convicted shall work on the city's

thereof, such repealed portions shall be excluded from the Code. The subsequent

time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are re-

stating the time of the adoption of such ordinance. Such book of ordinances and
all copies and extracts therefrom shall be evidence of the tenor and contents
of the ordinances therein inscribed, as well of such as have been heretofore or
as may be hereafter therein so inscribed.
Sec. 1-9.  Same - Effect of repeal.
The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinance in force before or at
the time the ordinance repealed took effect.  The repeal of an ordinance shall

It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City Council that the
sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable
and, if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall
be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of
competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the

charge will exceed the amount of the charge. Finally, the judge may waive or
reduce the charge for copies of or access to municipal court records if he

with all other requirements of this code except the licensing provisions.
   105.1.5 Revocation of contractor’s license.  A contractor’s license issued

contractor or builder holding a license knowingly gave false or misleading
information on his or her application.
      (2)   the contractor or builder holding a license has been finally
convicted of a violation of this code.
      (3)   the contractor or builder applying for or holding a license has
been finally convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime which directly relates
to the duties and responsibilities of the licensed occupation.
      In determining whether a criminal conviction directly relates to the
licensed occupation, the Building Official shall consider:
      (1)   the nature and seriousness of the crime;
      (2)   the relationship of the crime to the purposes for requiring a
license to engage in the occupation;
      (3)   the extent to which a license might offer an opportunity to engage
in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person
previously has been involved; and
      (4)   the relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity, or fitness
required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the
licensed occupation.
      In addition to the other factors that may be considered under this
section, the Building Official, in determining the present fitness of a person
who has been convicted or a crime, shall consider the following evidence:
      (1)   the extent and nature of the person’s past criminal activity;
      (2)   the age of the person at the time of the commission of the crime;
      (3)   the amount of time that has elapsed since the person’s last
criminal activity;
      (4)   the conduct and work activity of the person prior to and following
the criminal activity;
      (5)   evidence of the person’s rehabilitation or rehabilitative effort
while incarcerated or following release;
      (6)   other evidence of the person’s present fitness, including letters
of recommendation from: prosecution, law enforcement, and correctional officers
who prosecuted, arrested, or had custodial responsibility for the person; the
sheriff and Chief of Police in the community where the person resides; and any
other persons in contact with the convicted person; and
      (7)   it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to the extent
possible to secure and provide to the Building Official the recommendations of
the prosecution, law enforcement, and correctional authorities as required
under this ordinance; the applicant shall also furnish proof in such form as
may be required by the Building Official that he or she has maintained a record
of steady employment and has supported his or her dependents and has otherwise
maintained a record of good conduct and has paid all outstanding court costs,
supervision fees, fines, and restitution as may have been ordered in all
criminal cases in which he or she has been convicted.
      Any revocation of a contractor’s license under this Section 105.1.4 shall
be for a minimum period of 30 days up to a maximum period of one year, within
the discretion of the Building Official.  If the Building Official suspends or
revokes a valid license or denies a person a license or the opportunity to be
examined for a license because of the person’s prior conviction of a crime and
the relationship of the crime to the license, the Building Official shall
notify the person in writing:
      (1)   of the reasons for the suspension, revocation, denial, or
disqualification;
      (2)   of the review procedure provided by Section 105.1.5; and
      (3)   of the earliest date that the person may appeal.
   105.1.6 Appeal of license revocation.  A decision of the Building Official
to revoke a contractor’s license may be appealed to the Construction Advisory
and Appeals Board by giving written notice of intent to appeal said decision to
the Building Official within ten calendar days from the date the contractor or
builder is notified of the revocation of the license.  Such notice shall

the termination of the appeal.
Upon receipt of said notice of intent to appeal, the Building Official shall

building to be vacated, secured, repaired, removed, or demolished by the owner
or for the occupants to be relocated by the owner and an additional reasonable
time for the ordered action to be taken by any of the mortgagees or lienholders
in the event the owner fails to comply with the order within the timeframe
provided for action by the owner.  The city is not required to furnish any
notice to a mortgagee or lienholder other than a copy of the order in the event
the owner fails to timely take the ordered action.  Subsequent to each
proceeding, the court shall make written findings of fact as to whether or not
the building or structure under review is in fact a dangerous building as that
term is defined herein.
(e)   If the court finds that the building or structure is a dangerous building
or structure as defined in Section 19-50 of this article, the court shall issue

structure, as appropriate.  As necessary, the court may also issue a warrant
authorizing the city to vacate, secure, repair, remove or demolish said
building or structure as appropriate, after the time has expired for the owner,
mortgagee, or lienholder to take the ordered actions.
(f)   In addition to written findings of fact as required herein, the court
shall keep a record of its proceedings and official actions.
(g)   Notice.
   (1)   Unless other requirements are specified herein, notice of all
proceedings before the court must be given:
      a.   by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the record owners of
the affected property, and to each holder of a recorded lien against the
affected property, as shown by the records in the office of the County Clerk of
the county in which the affected property is located if the address of the
lienholder can be ascertained from the deed of trust establishing the lien or
from other applicable instruments on file in the office of the County Clerk;
      b.   to all unknown owners, by posting a copy of the notice on the front
door of each improvement situated on the affected property or as close to the
front door as practicable; and
      c.   by filing the notice in the official public record of real property
in the county in which the property is located.
   (2)   The notice shall be mailed and posted before the tenth day before the
date of the proceeding before the court and must state the date, time, and
place of the proceeding. In addition, the notice shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city on one occasion before the tenth
day before the date fixed for the hearing.
   (3)   All notices sent by mail shall contain as a minimum the following:
      a.   an identification, which is not required to be a legal description,
of the building and the property on which it is located;
      b.   a description of the violation of city codes or articles that exist
at the building; and
      c.   a statement that the city will vacate, secure, repair, remove, or
demolish the building if ordered action is not taken within a reasonable time.
   (4)   Following each proceeding, the court shall issue an order and a
warrant containing provisions as set out herein which shall be mailed, filed,
and published in accordance with subsection (k)(1) of this section.  Each such
order shall specify the action to be taken as part of the notice and shall
specify a reasonable time within which the owner is to take such action.  The
order shall provide further notice and specify an additional reasonable time
within which any mortgagee or lienholder may undertake the ordered action in
the event the owner fails to comply with the order within the time specified
for action by the owner. The city shall not be required to furnish any notice
to a mortgagee or lienholder other than a copy of the order in the event the
owner fails to timely take the ordered action.  The city may immediately
proceed with actions authorized in the order; provided, however, that the city
may obtain a warrant for any such actions and shall obtain a warrant for any
actions for which a warrant is required by law.  The court may issue any and
all warrants that the court has authority to issue under state and federal law.
(h)   Authority of the court. Following notice and hearing, the court may:
   (1)   declare a building dangerous in accordance with the standards set out
in this article;
   (2)   upon a proper showing as set out herein, issue an order specifying a
reasonable time for the building or other structure to be vacated, secured,
repaired, removed or demolished by the owner or upon the refusal of the owner
to comply, by the mortgagee or lienholder. The court may  also issue a warrant
authorizing the city to vacate, secure, repair, remove or demolish said
building or structure as appropriate after the time has expired for the owner,
mortgagee, or lienholder to take the ordered actions; or
   (3)   upon a finding that the owner was actually notified of the provisions
of this article and any other applicable city building standards, and a further
finding that after the owner received notice of the article's provisions, the
owner committed acts in violation of the article or failed to take action
necessary for compliance with the article, the court then may determine the
amount and duration of a civil penalty which the city may be entitled to
recover for such violations, not to exceed $1,000.00 a day for each violation
of this article.
(i)   Standards. The following standards shall be applied by the court in
determining whether or not to order a building or structure repaired, removed,
vacated, demolished, or secured, or a combination of such remedies:
   (1)   If the dangerous building or structure can be reasonably repaired so
that it will no longer be in a condition which is in violation of this article,
it shall be ordered repaired.
   (2)   If the dangerous building or structure is in such condition as to make
it dangerous to the health, safety, or general welfare of its occupants or of
the public, it shall be ordered to be vacated.
   (3)   In any case where a dangerous building or structure is so damaged or
destroyed that it cannot be repaired so that its existence will no longer be in
violation of the terms of this article, it shall be ordered demolished or
removed.
   (4)   If open to the public such as to constitute a threat to public health
or safety, the court may order such building secured by such means as the court
shall deem appropriate.
   (5)   If the court finds that the building or structure is unoccupied and is
a dangerous building or structure as defined herein, the court shall issue an
order and/or warrant ordering the termination of utility service.
(j)   Civil penalties final.
   (1)   An assessment of a civil penalty by the court as provided in this
article is final and binding and constitutes prima facie evidence of the
penalty in any court of competent jurisdiction in a civil suit brought by the
city for final judgement as provided elsewhere herein.
   (2)   To enforce any civil penalty as assessed hereunder, the City Secretary
shall file with the district clerk of the appropriate county wherein the
property is located a certified copy of the court's order establishing the
amount and duration of the civil penalty.  No other proof is required for a
district court to enter final judgement on said penalty.
(k)   Judicial review of decisions.
   (1)   Any persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the
civil municipal court may present a petition to a district court, duly
verified, setting forth that the decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and
specifying the grounds of the illegality.  The petition must be presented to
the district court within 30 calendar days after the date a copy of the final
decision and order of the civil municipal court is mailed by first class mail,
certified, return receipt requested, to all persons entitled to receive notice
as provided herein.  The civil municipal court shall mail that copy promptly
after the decision becomes final.  In addition, a copy shall be published one
time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city within ten calendar days
after the date of the mailing of the copy as provided herein, and a copy shall
also be filed in the office of the City Secretary.
   (2)   On presentation of the petition, the district court may allow a writ
of certiorari directed to the civil municipal court to review the decision of
the civil municipal court and shall prescribe in the writ the time, which may
not be less than ten days, within which a return on the writ must be made and
served on the relator or the relator's attorney.
   (3)   The civil municipal court may not be required to return the original
papers acted on by it.  It is sufficient for the civil municipal court to
return certified or sworn copies of the papers or parts of the papers as may be
called for by the writ.
   (4)   The return must concisely set forth other facts as may be pertinent
and material to show the grounds for the decision appealed from and shall be
verified.
   (5)   The allowance of the writ does not stay proceedings on the decision
appealed from, but the district court and for due cause shown, may grant a
restraining order or injunction.
   (6)   If, on a hearing by the district court, it appears to the district
court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, the
district court may take evidence or appoint a referee to take evidence as it
may direct and report the evidence to the district court with the referee's
findings of fact and conclusions of law, which constitute a part of the
proceedings on which the determination of the district court shall be made. 
The district court may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify
the decision brought up for review.
   (7)   Costs may not be allowed against the city unless it appears to the
district court that the city acted with gross negligence, in bad faith, or with
malice in making the decision appealed from.
   (8)   If the decision of the civil municipal court is affirmed or not
substantially reversed but only modified, the district court shall allow to the
city all attorneys fees and other costs and expenses incurred by it and shall
enter a judgment for those items, which may be entered against the property
owners as well as all persons found to be in occupation of the property subject
to the proceedings before the civil municipal court.
(l)   Civil municipal court's decision final. If no appeals are taken to a
court of proper jurisdiction from the decision of the civil municipal court
within the required period as specified herein, the decision of the civil
municipal court is, in all things, final and binding.
(m)   Lien; abstract.
   (1)   An abstract of judgment shall be issued against all parties found to
be the owners of the subject property or in possession of the property.
   (2)   A lienholder shall not have standing to bring a judicial review as
provided herein on the grounds that the lienholder was not notified of the
proceedings before the civil municipal court or was unaware of the condition of
the property, unless the lienholder had first appeared before the civil
municipal court and entered an appearance in opposition to the proceedings.
(Ord. No. 2893, § 2, 1-13-00; Ord. No. 3113, § 4, 3-21-02)
Sec. 19-53.  Actions by the city.
(a)   If a building or structure is not vacated, secured, repaired, removed, or
demolished in accordance with an order of the court, the city may vacate,
secure, remove, repair, or demolish the building; provided, however, that the
city may obtain a warrant from the court for any such action and shall obtain a
warrant where so required by state of federal law.
(b)   If the city incurs expenses under this section, the city may assess the
expenses on, and the city shall have a lien against, unless it is a homestead
as protected by the Texas Constitution, the property on which the building or
structure is located. The lien is extinguished if the property owner or other
person having an interest in the legal title to the property reimburses the
city for the expenses. The lien arises and attaches to the property at the time
the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the County
Clerk in the county in which the property is located. The notice must contain
the name and address of the owner if that information can be determined with a
reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property on which the
building or structure is located, the amount of expenses incurred by the city,
and the balance then due.
(c)   If notice is given and the opportunity to repair, remove, demolish, or
secure the building is afforded to each mortgagee and lienholder as authorized
herein, the lien shall be a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens and
all previously recorded bona fide mortgage liens attached to the real property
to which the city's lien attaches.

(1)   Inspect or cause to be inspected any building or structure situated
within the city in which the Building Official has reason to believe that
conditions exist which render such structure a dangerous building as that term
is defined herein.
(2)   If, upon inspection and investigation, the Building Official finds that
the building or structure is a dangerous building as that term is defined
herein, the Building Official shall issue a notice, which such notice shall in
all things comply with the terms and provisions of Section 19-52(g) of this
article,  advising any person interested in such dangerous building or
structure, or his or her authorized agent or representative, and all
lienholders of notice, to appear and show cause why the court should not issue
an order for action against such building or structure in accordance with this
article.
(3)   Place a notice on said dangerous building or structure to read
substantially as follows:
   NOTICE - DANGEROUS BUILDING.
   The city has deemed this building to be unsafe for occupancy or use. Do not
remove this notice. Removal of this notice is punishable by a maximum fine of

      c.   publishing the notice at least twice within a ten day period in a

Article IV.
Secured Building Permit
Sec. 19-81.  Secured building permit created.
A property owner may, upon proper application and satisfaction of all
requirements of this article, obtain a secured building permit for any
qualified building within the city limits of the City of Longview, Texas. The
issuance of a permit as authorized herein is a privilege and not a matter of
right.
Sec. 19-82.  Application; criteria for issuance.
Application for a secured building permit shall be made to the office of the
chief Building Official of the City of Longview, Texas, on forms as the
Building Official shall require. To qualify for the issuance of a secured
building permit, the owner and the property proposed for permitting shall
satisfy all of the following requirements:
(1)   The building shall be structurally sound, including sound structural
supports and support members and a structurally sound roof such that the
property is not in danger of collapse, does not experience deterioration from
the weather or the elements, and does not constitute an immediate or long-term
threat or menace to the health or safety.  The Building Official, or on proper
appeal, the Building and Standards Commission of the City of Longview, shall
determine the standards for and shall adjudge the structural soundness of a
particular building or structure for which a secured building permit is sought.
(2)   At the time of application, and during the entire term of the permit, the
building shall remain vacant.
(3)   At the time of the application, and during the entire term of the permit,
all utilities shall be disconnected from the premises.
(4)   At the time of the application, and during the entire term of the permit,
the building shall be secured.  For purposes of this article, a building shall
be considered secure if all windows are covered if broken, all open access
doorways are covered securely, and all other openings or access to the building
are secured from entry from the outside.  In securing said building, the
permittee shall be required to comply with any plan for securing the building
specified by the Building Official.  In securing said premises, the owner may
use plywood or other material acceptable to the Building Official and stencil
thereon a notice to read substantially as follows:
   "SECURED BUILDING MATERIALS; REMOVAL, SALE, OR PURCHASE OF THIS MATERIAL
WITHOUT CONSENT OF THE OWNER SHALL CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE V OF THE
CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF LONGVIEW AND SHALL SUBJECT THE VIOLATOR TO
FINES OR PENALTIES NOT TO EXCEED $500.00."
(5)   During the term of the permit, the structure shall otherwise comply with
all city ordinances or regulations dealing with the control of weeds, vectors,
abandoned vehicles, abandoned junk, or other ordinances as the same shall apply
to the external condition of the premises.
(6)   The owner of the building as part of the permitting process shall agree
in writing that the police department, fire department, building inspection
department, or any other applicable department of the city shall have access to
the premises at all times while on official business. The building owner shall
likewise agree in writing that, save and except for officials of the city as
specified herein, only the building owner or the owner's lawfully authorized
agent shall have access to and enter the building during the time that such
building is governed by a secured building permit.
(7)   No enforcement action is currently pending against the property or its
owner before the city's Building and Standards Commission or under any other
city ordinance; provided, however, that a secured building permit may be issued
upon a finding by the Building and Standards Commission in an enforcement
proceeding, and in response to a request by the owner, that a property the
subject of such proceeding is otherwise qualified for such a permit. In the
event of such a finding, the property owner shall comply with all the terms and
conditions for the issuance of said permit as set out herein, and upon issuance
of such permit, the enforcement action then pending before the Building and
Standards Commission shall be abated, but not dismissed. For so long as a valid
secured building permit is maintained for the property, the pending enforcement
action shall remain in abated status, but at such time as the property is no
longer governed by a valid secured building permit, the abated enforcement
action shall be placed upon an ensuing agenda of the Building and Standards
Commission for review and subsequent action.
Sec. 19-83.  Effect of issuance of a secured building permit.
For such time as any building is governed by a valid, unexpired secured
building permit, and all conditions for the original issuance of said permit
shall continue to be satisfied, including proper security of the building and
all utilities remaining disconnected, the building shall be exempted from
complying with all internal nonstructural requirements of the city building
code, electrical code, plumbing code, or other applicable codes of the City of
Longview save and except the city fire code, which shall continue to apply as
to any condition of the building which constitutes an immediate fire hazard. In
addition, while such building continues to be governed by a valid, unexpired
permit for which all conditions continue to be met as specified in this
article, no enforcement action shall be taken by the City of Longview pursuant
to Article III, Chapter 19 of the Code of Ordinances, generally referred to as
the building and standards ordinance.
Sec. 19-84.  Maintaining a secured building permit.
The building owner shall be responsible for keeping the building at all times
in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the secured building
permit. If the building shall become noncompliant with the terms and provisions
of this article, as found by the Building Official or as found by the Building
and Standards Commission on appeal from a decision of the Building Official,
then any outstanding secured building permit shall be revoked.

resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. No. 3242, § 4, 8-28-03)

be in all things compliant with this article, shall be valid for a period of
one year from the date of issuance.
Sec. 19-87.  Permit renewal.

renewals provided the building owner files proper application on such forms as
shall be established by the chief Building Official for such permit renewal and
satisfies all of the following requirements:
(1)   A showing that all of the original requirements for issuance of the
permit continue to be satisfied, including a showing that the condition of the

provided such inspector shall meet all the requirements of state law as set out
in Section 18C of Article 6573a, Vernon's Texas Statutes, regarding licensed
real estate inspectors. The inspector shall document in writing the results of
the inspection, such documentation to be in such form as the Building Official
shall specify. Any inspector who intentionally or repeatedly falsifies or
provides incomplete reports as required herein may be excluded by the Building
Official as an acceptable inspector for the purposes of this article.
Sec. 19-88.  Reoccupation of a secured building.
Before a building governed by a secured building permit can be reoccupied, the
building owner must satisfy the following conditions:
(1)   The building must be returned to full compliance with any and all
applicable city codes, including but not limited to the city building code,

(3)   The owner shall apply for and receive a new occupancy permit, including
payment of any applicable occupancy fee.
(4)   No utilities shall be turned on in the building until full compliance
with all outstanding city codes and compliance with this article; however,

to bring the building back into compliance with all applicable codes.

spas and to enforce applicable Texas Department of State Health Services
regulations, a valid city pool permit does not guarantee that the inspected
pool or spa is safe.  The city does not warrant that any pool or spa, whether
inspected or uninspected, is compliant with federal, state or local
regulations, including without limitation the regulations set forth in this
article.
(Ord. No. 3057, § 2, 8-23-01; Ord. No. 3085, § 11, 1-10-02; Ord. No. 3525, §
23, 6-14-07)
Sec. 19-146.   Closure of pool or spa.
(a)   Failure to comply with any provision of this article may result in the
denial or suspension of a pool permit, the immediate closure of the pool or spa
and/or the initiation of legal action.
(b)   Upon determination that a pool or spa does not comply with the provisions
of this article, the administrator shall notify the owner or person in charge
of the pool or spa of the existing violations.  If the pool or spa does not
have a permit or is applying for the renewal of an existing permit, the
administrator may deny the issuance of the requested permit until the
violations are corrected.  If the administrator determines that the condition
of the pool or spa is hazardous to the health or safety of its users or of the
general public, the administrator shall immediately suspend the pool permit of
the pool or spa until such time as the condition of the pool or spa no longer
poses a hazard to the health or safety of its users or of the general public.
If the pool or spa currently possesses a valid pool permit and the
administrator determines that the condition of the pool or spa is not
immediately hazardous to the health or safety of its users or of the general
public, the administrator may specify a reasonable time period in which the
pool or spa must be brought into compliance with the provisions of this
article.  If the pool or spa is not brought into compliance within said time
period, the administrator may suspend the pool permit until such time as the
pool or spa is brought into compliance.  If a fee required under the provisions
of this article has not been paid, the administrator may suspend the pool
permit for the pool or spa or deny a permit for said pool or spa until such
time as the appropriate fee is paid.
(c)   Any pool permit suspended for a period of more than 30 days shall be
automatically considered revoked. Any pool or spa for which the pool permit has
been revoked must reapply for a new permit under this article in order to
operate.
(d)   Any pool or spa that does not possess a valid permit must be immediately
closed.  Any pool or spa with a valid pool permit which has not been suspended
or revoked and for which the renewal of the pool permit has been denied shall
be closed immediately upon the expiration of the existing pool permit.
(e)   Signs shall be posted at all entrances to any pool or spa that has been
closed under the provisions of this section. Said signs shall be clearly
visible to a reasonably observant person and shall state, "Closed By The
Longview Environmental Health Division."  Signs posted by the administrator
stating "Closed By the Longview Environmental Health Division" shall not be
altered or removed unless authorized by the administrator.
(f)   A reinspection of the pool or spa will be conducted during the regular
working hours of the administrator at the request of the owner or the person in
charge of the pool or spa. If compliance has been achieved, the administrator
shall notify the owner or person in charge of the pool or spa of said
compliance. Upon such a determination of compliance, the pool permit shall be
reinstated if it was suspended (without being revoked) and the pool or spa
shall be allowed to open.  If there was not a valid pool permit due to any
reason other than suspension, then a new pool permit must be obtained in order
to open the pool or spa.
(g)   When a pool or spa does not have a valid pool permit in effect, the owner
and the person in charge of such pool or spa shall not knowingly allow the pool
or spa to be used for swimming, diving or bathing purposes and shall
immediately take every reasonable step to prevent the use of such pool or spa
for such purposes. By way of example and without limiting such duty, the owner
or person in charge of the pool or spa shall (1) immediately post notices
reasonably likely to come to the attention of potential users of the pool or
spa, advising of the closure, and (2) shall immediately lock all gates and
doorways in any fence or other enclosure surrounding such pool or spa.
(h)   Use of a pool or spa by an individual for swimming, diving or bathing
purposes when the pool or spa does not have in effect a valid pool permit shall
be deemed prima facie evidence that the owner and the person in charge of said
pool or spa have knowingly allowed the pool or spa to be used for such
purposes.
(i)   The administrator may, based on the nature and extent of the violation(s)
present, affix a lock or similar closing mechanism on the gate or gates leading
to a pool or spa that does not have in effect a valid pool permit. 
(j)   A person commits an offense if the person uses a pool or spa that does
not have in effect a valid pool permit and shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine as provided in this article.
(Ord. No. 3057, § 2, 8-23-01; Ord. No. 3085, § 11, 1-10-02)
Sec. 19-147.   Filling of pools and spas.
A pool or spa substantially in noncompliance with the provisions of this
article or of state law such that said pool or spa constitutes a menace or
hazard to the public health or safety shall be deemed a dangerous building or
structure within the meaning of Article III of Chapter 19 of this Code.  Upon
compliance with all of the relevant provisions of said Article III, the civil
municipal court may apply any of the remedies provided by said Article III to
said pool or spa and/or may order that the pool or spa be demolished and/or
filled with inert material.  In accordance with the provisions of the aforesaid
Article III, and without limiting the remedies available to the city under said
provisions, the city may perform the work ordered by the civil municipal court
and place a lien against the property on which the pool or spa is located.

The City Council hereby finds and declares that this article is an ordinance
governing public health and sanitation.  Any person who violates a provision of
this article and any person who is the permit holder for or otherwise operates

any responsible officer of that permit holder or those persons shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of up to $2,000.00, as
provided in Section 1-4 of this code and Section 54.001 of the Texas Local

enforcement action authorized by law, including without limitation the
revocation or suspension of a pool permit and/or the immediate closure of a
pool or spa in accordance with the requirements of this article.

Article III.
Excluding Individuals from City Property
Sec. 25-30. Purpose of this chapter.
This chapter establishes a procedure for prohibiting individuals from entering
or remaining upon city property due to the criminal violations or disruptive
conduct of the individual who is being excluded from the property.
(Ord. No. 3776, 8-25-11)
Sec. 25-31. Definitions.
   Exclude shall mean to bar or prohibit entrance.
(Ord. No. 3776, 8-25-11)
Sec. 25-32. Excluding individuals from city property; hearing provided.
 
   a.   When an individual has committed a criminal act or acts, or violates
any rule governing conduct upon a city-owned property, such property as, but
not limited to, the Longview Public Library, city parks or recreational
facilities, or other city buildings, the individual may be excluded from the
property to ensure the safety and security of citizens and employees, and to
provide for the peaceful enjoyment of public property.
   b.    A city employee charged with the supervision of a city property or any
City of Longview Police Officer, is authorized to issue notice to the
individual who has committed a criminal act or acts upon or in close proximity
to the property, or who has violated a rule governing conduct upon city-owned
property, that the individual must leave the property and not return to said
property.  The individual being excluded from the city-owned property must be
advised which property he or she is excluded from.
   c.   Upon excluding an individual from city-owned property, the city
employee charged with supervision of the property, or an involved City of
Longview Police Officer, must notify the individual being excluded that he or
she has ten (10) calendar days to appeal the exclusion by contacting the City
of Longview Municipal Court Clerk to establish a time and date for a hearing
before the Judge of the City of Longview Municipal Court.  The city employee
charged with supervision of the property, or an involved City of Longview
Police Officer will also provide written notice to the individual being
excluded from the city-owned property of the individual's right to a hearing. 
Written notice may be provided to the individual at the time of exclusion, or
by mail to the individual's last known address. The individual being excluded
from city-owned property may not return upon the property from which he or she
is being excluded unless and until the decision to exclude the individual from
city-owned property is overturned by the City of Longview Municipal Court.
   d.   When an individual being excluded from city-owned property requests a
hearing within the prescribed ten (10) calendar day period, the Court shall set
a hearing, said hearing to be held within ten (10) calendar days of receiving
the request, and will immediately notify the City Attorney's Office, the city
employee who excluded the individual from the city-owned property, and the
individual being excluded from the city-owned property.
   e.   The hearing shall be conducted solely to determine if the decision to
exclude the individual from city-owned property should be upheld or
overturned.  The Court shall provide a decision in writing upon conclusion of
the hearing and the decision of the City of Longview Municipal Court shall be
final.  Should the Court determine that the individual excluded from the city-
owned property should be permitted to return upon such property, the City of
Longview Municipal Court will ensure that the Longview Police Department is
notified that the individual is now permitted on the city-owned property and
that all notations concerning the exclusion are removed from the Police
Department computer.
   f.   An individual who has been excluded from city-owned property may
provide a request in writing to the City of Longview Municipal Court seeking
permission to return upon the city-owned property from which the individual has
been excluded two years after the date of the order excluding the individual
from the city-owned property.  The individual must provide an affidavit stating
that he or she has not entered onto the city-owned property during the past two
year period and that the individual has no arrest or criminal convictions
during the same period of time.  The Court may then set a hearing at the
Court's convenience and shall notify the City Attorney's Office, the city
employee who excluded the individual from the city-owned property, and the
individual who was excluded from the city-owned property and now seeks
permission to return.
   g.   The Judge of the City of Longview Municipal Court shall determine if
the individual previously excluded from city-owned property may return upon
such property or if the individual shall continue to be excluded from the city-
owned property.  The Court shall issue a written order of its determination. 
An individual who is permitted to return upon the city-owned property from
which he or she has been previously excluded, shall be subject to all statutes,
ordinances, rules, regulation, orders and directives which apply to an
individual entering upon or using said property.
   h.   When an individual who has been previously excluded from city-owned
property is permitted to return upon such property, the City of Longview
Municipal Court will ensure that the Longview Police Department is notified
that the individual is now permitted on the city-owned property and that all
notations concerning the exclusion are removed from the Police Department
computer.
   i.   If an individual is subsequently excluded from any city-owned property
and the exclusion is upheld by the City of Longview Municipal Court, the
individual excluded from the property may not enter the property again.
   j.   The City of Longview City Council hereby dispenses with the requirement
of establishing a culpable mental state in order to prove a violation of the
chapter.

Chapter 380 Economic Development Program
Sec. 33-1.   General statement of purpose and policy.
The City of Longview is committed to the promotion of high quality development
in all parts of the city and to an ongoing improvement in the quality of life
for its citizens.  The city has previously developed economic development
programs and incentives designed to encourgage high quality business,

City of Longview.  Now the city seeks to enhance its economic development
efforts to attract and retain high quality development and jobs by establishing
the Chapter 380 Economic Development Program set forth in this article.
This Chapter 380 Economic Development Program is established in an effort to
develop and expand the local economy by promoting and encouraging development
and redevelopment projects that enhance the city's economic base and diversity
and expand job opportunities or by promoting and encouraging projects that
create additional revenues for the city that exceed any resulting increase in
the demand on city services or infrastructure.  The ultimate goal and public
purpose of this Chapter 380 Economic Development Program is to protect and
enhance the city's fiscal ability to provide high quality municipal services
for the safety, comfort and enjoyment of city residents.  In furtherance of
these objectives, the City of Longview will, on a case-by-case basis, give
consideration to providing economic incentives to Applicants in accordance with
this article as authorized by Chapter 380 of the Texas Local Government Code,
as amended from time to time.
Nothing in this article is intended to imply or suggest that the City of
Longview is under any obligation to provide any economic incentives to any
Applicant.  All Applications shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.  The
decision to approve or deny economic incentives shall be at the discretion of
the city.  Each Applicant granted Assistance pursuant to this Chapter 380
Economic Development Program must enter into a 380 Agreement containing all
terms required by this article and by state law.
Sec. 33-2.   Program established; authority.
Pursuant to the authority provided by Section 380.001 of the Texas Local
Government Code, there is hereby established a program to promote local
economic development and to stimulate business and commercial activity in the

providing personnel and services of the municipality.

submitted, the Administrator shall review the Application for qualifications of

days after the date on which the City Council approves the Assistance.  If the

pertaining to the Assistance.  Alternatively, the Administrator and the

and the remedies set out in Subchapter B of Chapter 54 of the Texas Local
Government Code, or its successor statute, as the same shall exist or hereafter

completed and all outlets supplied with approved fixtures, devices, or covers
and such electrical work has been finally approved for service.
(d)   When any electrical work for which a permit is required under this

Official may prescribe. The Building Official shall inspect such electrical
work as soon as practical.
(e)   Whenever the complexity of electrical work may demand it, the Building
Official may schedule inspections to be made of phases of electrical work
completed and ready for inspection.  It shall be unlawful for any person to

the person to whom the permit was issued.
(b)    Unless otherwise expressly provided by state or federal law, allegation
and evidence of culpable mental state are not required for the proof of an
offense defined by this section.

reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure,
or a series of such reconstructions, rehabilitations, additions, or other
improvements of a structure, which are initiated after the effective date of
this chapter, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the
market value of the structure as of the date of the "start of construction" of
the first improvement following the effective date of this chapter. For
purposes of this provision, market value shall be the appraised value of the
structure as reflected in the official records of the Central Appraisal
District with jurisdiction over the structure. This includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
   (1)   any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions, or
   (2)   any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure."
   Variance.  The term “variance” shall mean a grant of relief to a person from
any requirement found in the flood damage prevention regulations of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by the flood damage prevention regulations of this chapter. (For
full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations.)
   Water surface elevation.  The term “water surface elevation” shallmean the
height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or

(Ord. No. 3939, § 4, 8-14-14)
Sec. 43-24.  Variance procedures.
(a)   The City Council shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances
from the flood damage prevention regulations of this chapter.
(b)   The City Council shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it
is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the City Engineer in the enforcement or administration of the flood
damage prevention regulations of this chapter.
(c)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the City Council may
appeal such decisions to a court of competent jurisdiction solely on the
grounds that the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or not supported by
substantial evidence.
(d)   The City Engineer shall maintain a record of all actions involving an
appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
(e)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historical Places
or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of the flood damage prevention regulations of this
chapter.
(f)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood elevation, provided the relevant factors in Section 43-23 of this article
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(g)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of the flood
damage prevention regulations of this chapter, the City Council may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purpose and objectives of the flood damage prevention regulations of this
chapter.
(h)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(i)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
(j)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
   (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon (1) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, not attributable to any
actions or inactions on the part of the applicant; and (3) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances. The burden of proof in all variance
proceedings shall always be on the applicant.
   (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice stating the elevation, below the base flood elevation, at which the
proposed structure's lowest floor elevation will be permitted to be built, and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(k)   Variances may be issued by the City Council for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that (1) the criteria outlined in Article
III, Section 43-24(1)-(9) are met, and (2) the structure or other development
is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety.

Article IV.
Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
Sec. 43-31.  General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
(1)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
(2)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
(3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage.
(4)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
(5)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
(6)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from
the systems into floodwaters.
(7)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. No. 3939, §5, 8-14-14)
Sec. 43-32.  Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in (1) Article II, Section 43-12, (2) Article III,
Section 43-22(8), or (3) Article IV, Section 43-34(c) the following provisions
are required:
(1)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of
any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated no less than two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the City Engineer that the proposed construction or substantial improvement,
as described in the application required by Section 43-23 of Article III
(including without limitation the proposed elevation provided in said
application pursuant to  Article III, Section 43-23(a)(1), satisfies the
requirements of the subsection.
(2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure shall either
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated not less than two feet
above the level of the base flood elevation, or, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities be floodproofed so that below the base flood
elevation the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.  A
registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review
structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall
certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection.  A record of
such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean
seal level) to which such structures are flood-proofed shall be maintained by
the floodplain administrator.
(3)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement that are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
   a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided.
   b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
   c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
(4)   Manufactured homes.
   a.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A, shall
be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the
purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.  Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors.  This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
   b.   All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with Article IV, Section
43-32(1).
   c.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved within Approximate or A Zones or in Zones AH or AE on the city's FIRM
be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is no less than two feet above the base flood elevation; and
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance
with the provisions of Section 43-32(4) of this Article IV.
   d.   Require that no manufactured home shall be placed in a floodway.
   e.   Recreational vehicles.  Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Approximate or A Zones or Zones AH or AE on the city's FIRM either
(1) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, (2) be fully licensed
and ready for highway use, or (3) meet the permit requirements of Article III,
Section 43-23, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured
homes" in paragraph (4) of this section.  A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
(5)   Floodways.  Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
Article II, Section 43-12, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is extremely hazardous due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
   a.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   b.   If Article IV, Section 43-32(5)(a)above is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of Article IV.
   c.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Regulations, the city may permit encroachments within
the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood
elevations, provided that the city first applies for a conditional FIRM and
floodway revision through FEMA.
   d.   Prohibit the placement of any manufactured home.
(6)   Approximate or A Zone.  In Approximate or A Zones, flood hazard areas
where base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with
Article II, Section 43-12, the following provisions shall apply:
   a.   A base flood elevation shall be established in accordance with Article
III, Section 43-22(8).
   b.   The City Engineer shall apply the provisions of Article IV to the base
flood elevation established, but in no case shall the elevation of the lowest
floor be less than one foot above the highest adjacent grade next to the
building site.
In all other areas located outside of special flood hazards, all new
construction and substantial improvements of residential or nonresidential
structures shall have the lowest floor elevated at least six inches above the
highest adjacent grade next to the building site.
(Ord. No. 3939, § 5, 8-14-14)
Sec. 43-33.  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article II,
Section 43-12, are areas designated as shallow flooding.  These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident.  Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
(1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the city's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
(2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
   a.   have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest
adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the
city's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
   b.   together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so
that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy.
(3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the proposed construction or
substantial improvement, as described in the application required by Section
43-23 of Article III (including without limitation the proposed elevation
provided in said application pursuant to Article III, Section 43-23 (a)(1)),
satisfies the requirements of this section
(4)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes, to guide flood water around and away from proposed structures.
(Ord. No. 3939, § 5, 8-14-14)
Sec. 43-34.  Standards for development and subdivision proposals.
(a)   All commercial and residential subdivision proposals, including without
limitation manufactured home parks, shall be consistent with the purposes and
objectives of this chapter.
(b)   All proposals for the development of commercial and residential
subdivisions, including without limitation manufactured home parks, shall meet
development permit requirements of Article II, Section 43-13, Article III,
Section 43-23, and provisions of Article IV of this chapter.
(c)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided by the developer for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development including manufactured
home parks which is greater than the lesser of 30 lots, or three acres, if not
otherwise provided pursuant to Article II, Section 43-12 or Article III,
Section 43-22(8) of this chapter.
(d)   All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(e)   All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(f)   All development and subdivision proposals, whether located within or
outside of special flood hazard areas, shall meet the applicable provisions of
the city's subdivision ordinance, as well as the master drainage plan and
Drainage Criteria and Erosion Control Manual, which is herein adopted.

within ten calendar days from the date the applicant is notified of the

Construction Advisory and Appeals Board should reverse or modify the decision
of the City Engineer.  Failure to state reason(s) shall result in the
termination of the appeal.
(c)   Upon receipt of said notice of intent to appeal, the City Engineer shall
schedule a meeting of the Construction Advisory and Appeals Board to consider
such appeal.  Such meeting shall be held within ten calendar days of the City
Engineer's receipt of notice of intent to appeal, unless the applicant requests
a longer period of time.

and Appeals Board shall render a decision sustaining, amending, or reversing
the decision of the City Engineer based upon the evidence present at the
hearing.  In deciding any appeal from the decision of the City Engineer,
including without limitation a decision to deny a variance or place a condition
on a variance, the Construction Advisory and Appeals Board shall be constrained

placed on the variance by the Construction Advisory and Appeals Board shall
constitute an ongoing condition of the development permit, and the applicant
shall comply with each such condition during the development of the subject
property.
(e)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Construction
Advisory and Appeals Board may appeal such decisions to a court of competent
jurisdiction solely on the grounds that the decision was arbitrary, capricious,

appeal and provide to the Construction Advisory and Appeals Board such
information as the Construction Advisory and Appeals Board may reasonably
require or request for deciding an appeal.

Sec. 46-3.   Permits.
(a)   Permit authorized and required.  The regulatory authority is hereby
authorized to issue permits for the operation of food establishments; provided
that only a person or firm that complies with the requirements of this article
shall be entitled to receive and retain such a permit.  A person may not
operate a food establishment in the city without a valid permit issued by the

Applicant must make written application on a form provided by the regulatory
authority.  The application must contain the name and address of each
applicant, the location where food is prepared, types of food served, and
methods of transporting and serving of foods.  Food establishments that possess
both a city food establishment permit and catering permit are exempt from the

of whether each such food establishment is owned by the same person or by
different persons.
(Ord. No. 3051, § 3, 8-9-01)

incomplete application will not be accepted.  Failure to provide all required
information, or falsifying information required may result in denial or
revocation of the permit.  Renewals of permits are required on an annual basis
and the same information is required for a renewal permit as for an initial

begun.  A food establishment is “extensively remodeled” when (1) 50% or greater
of the square footage within the food preparation area is to be remodeled or
(2) a building permit is required for work done within the food preparation
area.  The plans and specifications shall indicate the proposed layout,
equipment arrangement, mechanical plans and construction of materials of work
areas, and the type and model of proposed fixed equipment and facilities.  The
plans and specifications will be approved by the regulatory authority if they
meet the requirements of this article.  The establishment, construction,
remodeling or conversion must be according to the approved plans and
specifications.
(b)   Inspection. Whenever plans and specifications are required to be
submitted to the regulatory authority, the regulatory authority shall inspect
the food establishment to determine compliance with the approved plans and
specifications and with the requirements of this article.
(c)   Effect of noncompliance. Failure to follow the approved plans and
specifications or to obtain the necessary approval will result in a permit
denial, suspension, or revocation in accordance with the provisions of this
article.  The regulatory authority may also suspend or revoke a permit in
accordance with this article if a food establishment that is required to be
inspected under this section begins operations before passing said inspection.
Suspension, revocation, or denial of a permit or of permit renewal shall not
preclude the regulatory authority from taking any other enforcement action
authorized by this article or by other law.
(Ord. No. 3051, § 3, 8-9-01)

reports including any and all notices of violations issued within the previous
12 months must be maintained on premises and be made available for review by
the regulatory authority upon request.
(g)   Effect of noncompliance. A food establishment that does not comply with
this article will be denied a permit or the renewal of a permit or may have its
permit revoked or suspended in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
Suspension, revocation, or denial of a permit or of permit renewal shall not
preclude the regulatory authority from taking any other enforcement action
authorized by this article or by other law.
(Ord. No. 3051, § 3, 8-9-01)
Sec. 46-7.   Examination, detention, and condemnation of food.
(a)   Examination of food.  Food may be examined or sampled by the regulatory
authority as often as necessary for the enforcement of this article, including
without limitation, in conjunction with an inspection conducted under the
authority of this article.
(b)   Issuance of detention order.  The regulatory authority may place a
detention order on any food which the regulatory authority believes is in
violation of any provision of this article.  The detention order is effective

establishment at which the food is located or to the person in charge of the
food.
(c)   Notice.  The written notice of a detention order must specify the reasons
for the detention order.  The notice must also state that a request for hearing
may be filed within ten days and that if no hearing is requested, the food
shall be destroyed.  The regulatory authority shall tag, label or otherwise
identify any food subject to the detention order.  The tag, label, or other
identification placed on the food by the regulatory authority must not be
removed until and unless the detention order is lifted or vacated or the food
is destroyed as directed by the regulatory authority.
(d)   Effect of detention order.  No food subject to a detention order shall be
used, served or removed from the food establishment unless the regulatory
authority gives permission to destroy the food and the food is destroyed as
directed by the regulatory authority.  The regulatory authority shall permit
storage of the food under conditions specified in the detention order, unless
storage is not possible without risk to the public health, in which case
immediate destruction shall be ordered and accomplished.
(e)   Hearing.  A hearing shall be held if the hearing is requested within ten
days from the date on which the required notice of the detention order is
served.  On the basis of evidence produced at the hearing, the detention order
may be vacated or the permit holder or person in charge of the food may be
directed by written order to denature or destroy such food or to bring it into
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 3051, § 3, 8-9-01)
Sec. 46-8.   Voluntary closure.
If a food establishment closes due to potential health risk and the closure was
not ordered by the regulatory authority, the manager of or permit holder for
the food establishment shall immediately notify the regulatory authority of the
closure and of the reasons for the closure.  Any food establishment closed due
to potential health risk shall not reopen until authorized to do so by the
regulatory authority.
(Ord. No. 3051, § 3, 8-9-01)
Sec. 46-9.   Fees.
(a)   Fee for review of plans.  Preceding the review of any plans under Section
46-5 of this Code, the person operating (or who will be operating) a food
establishment shall pay to the city a fee for said review in the amount set by
resolution of the City Council.
(b)   Annual permit fee.  In addition to any fee due under subsection (a) of
this section, any person operating a food service establishment shall pay a
permit fee which shall extend to December 31 of the year issued.  Said permit
fee may be prorated.  If a permit for a permanent food service establishment is
not renewed prior to December 31 each year, a late penalty shall be added to
the annual permit fee and said late fee must be paid before the permit is
reinstated.  The annual permit fees and any exemptions thereto shall be as set
by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. No. 3051, § 3, 8-9-01; Ord No. 3600, §2, 9-11-08)
Sec. 46-10.   Suspension of permit.
(a)   Suspension of permit.  The regulatory authority may, without warning,
advance notice, or hearing, suspend any permit to operate a food establishment
if the operation of the food establishment constitutes an imminent hazard to
public health or if any required fee has not been paid by the appropriate
deadline.  Suspension is effective immediately upon service of the notice
required by this section.  When a permit is suspended, food operations shall
immediately cease.  Whenever a permit is suspended, the holder of the permit
shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing within 20 days of receipt of a
request for a hearing.
(b)   Notice.  Whenever a permit is suspended, the holder of the permit or the
person in charge shall be notified in writing that the permit is, upon service
of the notice, immediately suspended and that an opportunity for a hearing will
be provided if a written request for a hearing is filed with the regulatory
authority by the holder of the permit within ten days.  If no written request
for hearing is filed within ten days, the suspension is sustained.
(c)   Duration.  Suspension of a food permit shall continue until the
regulatory authority determines, after an inspection, that the reasons for
suspension no longer exist or until all required permit fees have been paid, as
applicable.
(d)   Other remedies reserved.  Suspension of a food permit shall not preclude
the regulatory authority from taking any other enforcement action authorized by
law, including without limitation the revocation of the suspended food permit
in accordance with the requirements of Section 46-11 of this Code.
(e)   Posting.  During the period of any permit suspension under this section,
the food service establishment subject to the suspension shall post a sign

The regulatory authority shall have the authority to promulgate reasonable
regulations as to the size and location of the sign and the size of the

inoperable for more than 30 consecutive days if the vehicle is on private
property.
(b)   Junked vehicles which are located in any place where they are visible
from a public place or public right-of-way are detrimental to the safety and
welfare of the general public, tending to reduce the value of private property,
to invite vandalism, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive
nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, and are
detrimental to the economic welfare of the city by producing urban blight which
is adverse to the maintenance and continuing development of the city and such
vehicles are therefore declared to be a public nuisance.
(c)   It shall be unlawful for a person to maintain a public nuisance as
determined under this section.
(d)   Whenever such public nuisance exists on private property within the city,
in violation of this section, the Chief of Police or his/her duly authorized
agent shall give not less than ten days written notice stating the nature of
the public nuisance and that it must be removed and abated within ten days and
that a request for a hearing must be made before expiration of said ten-day
period, such notice to be mailed by certified mail or registered mail with a
five-day return requested to the last known registered owner of the junked
vehicle, any lienholder of record, and the owner or the occupant of the private
premises whereupon such public nuisance exists.  If the notice is returned
undelivered by the United States Post Office, official action to abate said
nuisance shall be continued to a date not less than the eleventh day from the
date of such return.
(e)   Whenever such public nuisance exists on public property or on a public
right-of-way in violation of this section, the Chief of Police or his/her duly
authorized agent shall give not less than ten days written notice stating the
nature of the public nuisance and that it must be removed or abated within ten
days and that a request for a hearing must be made before expiration of said
ten-day period, such notice to be mailed, by certified mail or registered mail
with a five-day return requested, to the last known registered owner of the
junked vehicle, any lien holder of record, and the owner or occupant of the
public premises or to the owner or the occupant of the premises adjacent to the

held before the City Manager or his/her duly authorized agent, not earlier than
the eleventh day after service of notice to abate the nuisance.  At the
hearing, the junked vehicle is presumed to be inoperable unless the owner
demonstrates otherwise.
(h)   In the event, after public hearing, (or after the time for requesting a
hearing has expired without request, and any extended period of time for notice
as authorized herein has likewise expired), the City Manager or his/her duly
authorized designee shall determine that such vehicle or part thereof
constitutes a public nuisance, he/she may order the removal of such vehicle or
part thereof, which order shall include a description of the vehicle and the
correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available
at the site.
(i)   Upon the issuance of the order referred to in paragraph (h) hereof, the
Chief of Police or his/her duly authorized agent, shall go upon the premises
specified in such order and remove such vehicle or part thereof from the
premises to a scrap yard, demolishers or any suitable site designated by the
city.
(j)   Within five days after the date of removal of such vehicle or part
thereof, the Chief of Police or his/her duly authorized agent shall give notice
to the state highway department of such removal identifying the vehicle or part
thereof.
(k)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
   (1)   Unlicensed, operable or inoperable antique and special interest
vehicles stored by a collector on his private property, provided that the
vehicles in the outdoor storage areas are maintained in an orderly manner, that
they do not constitute a health hazard and are screened from ordinary public
view by means of a fence, rapidly growing trees, shrubbery or other appropriate
means.
   (2)   For purposes of this article, an "antique vehicle" is a passenger car
or truck that is at least 25 years old.  For purposes of this article, a

altered or modified from original manufacturer's specifications and, because of
its historic interest, is being preserved by hobbyists.  "Collector" means the
owner of one or more antique or special interest vehicles who collects,
purchases, acquires, trades, or disposes of special interest or antique
vehicles or parts of them for his own use in order to restore, preserve and
maintain an antique or special interest vehicle for historic interest.
(l)   All of the procedures set forth in this section shall be carried out by
salaried, full-time employees of the city except that the removal of vehicles
or parts thereof from property may be by any other duly authorized person.
(m)   The Chief of Police, his/her duly authorized agent, or any person
authorized by the city to administer the provisions of the procedures set forth
in this section may enter upon private property for the purposes specified
herein to examine vehicles or parts thereof, obtain information as to the
identity of the vehicle and to remove or cause the removal of a vehicle or part
thereof declared to be a nuisance pursuant hereto.  The municipal court of the
city shall have the authority to issue all orders necessary to enforce any
procedures set forth in this section.
(n)   If the public nuisance is not removed and abated and a hearing not
requested within the ten-day period provided by subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, a complaint may be filed against the party violating this section in
the municipal court of the city.
(o)   Nothing in this section shall affect any statute or ordinance that
permits immediate removal of a vehicle left on public property which
constitutes an obstruction to traffic.
(p)   Each individual violation of this section is a misdemeanor and, upon
adjudication of guilt, a fine not to exceed $2,000.00 shall be assessed against
such violator in accordance with the provisions of Section 1-4 of this Code. 
Each continuing day of each violation shall be deemed a separate offense for
which a separate fine may be assessed.  The City Council hereby dispenses with
the requirement of establishing a culpable mental state in order to prove a
violation of this section.
(q)   The relocation of a junked vehicle to another location in the city after
a proceeding for the abatement and removal of the junked vehicle has commenced
has no effect on the proceeding if the junked vehicle constitutes a public
nuisance at the new location.

not enclosed are not to be considered in making such measurements.  All
measurements will be made to the actual wall surface and not to any overhanging
roof eave or similar structure.
(c)   If any property owner denies access to their property for purposes of
determining the distance measurement from the wellhead to the walls of the
property owner's structure, then distances will be determined using
methodologies such as transit and angle measurements or other similar
methodology acceptable to the oil and gas inspector, which such distances shall
be accepted for all purposes under this ordinance as incontestable.
(d)   Any waiver form used to obtain written permission of the property owner
of any building as required herein shall contain, as a minimum, the following
information:
   (1)   the name and address of the property owner;
   (2)   a clear and unequivocal statement that the property owner agrees to
the permitting of the well as reflected by the duly acknowledged signature of
the property owner appearing on said form;
   (3)   a clear and unequivocal statement that the property owner may refuse
to agree to the permitting of the well;
   (4)   a statement of notice to the property owner that by affixing his or
her signature to the document, the property owner agrees to permit the driller
to place the signed document in the chain of title of the property owner and
that such document will in fact be placed in the chain of title of the
property;
   (5)   a statement of notice to the property owner that a permit to drill the
well will not be granted until such time as the applicant complies with all the
terms and provisions of Chapter 61 of the city's Code.
(e)   Any waiver form used to obtain written permission of the owner of any
building as required herein shall be subject to the following conditions to be
effective under this section:
   (1)   the term of the waiver must be stated in the document itself, not to
exceed a maximum term of two years;
   (2)   to satisfy the requirements for issuance of any permit hereunder, the
minimum term of said waiver must be effective for at least the minimum term of
the permit itself as set out in this section, and the permit itself shall be
void at such time as the waiver shall expire;
   (3)   all waivers must be filed of record in the county courthouse to be
effective;
   (4)   each applicant for a permit under this chapter requiring the use of
waivers as described herein shall specify on the permit application the
earliest date of expiration of approved waivers obtained by the applicant.
(f)   The applicant for a permit under this chapter shall approach all of the
owners of the residential and commercial buildings located within 300 feet of
any proposed well and make a good faith bona fide attempt to acquire their
approval on the requisite form as specified herein.  In so doing, the applicant
shall provide true and accurate information to the property owner.  If the
applicant is successful in obtaining 100 percent of the necessary waivers, the
applicant will be qualified to seek a Level A or B Permit as otherwise
specified herein.  If, however, all of the owners of the residences and
commercial buildings located within 300 feet of any proposed well have not
given their written permission, then the applicant will be required to obtain a
Level C Permit as specified herein.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-33.  Security required.
(a)   Generally.  In the event a permit is approved for issuance by the city
under the terms of this chapter for the drilling and operation of a well, no
actual drilling operation shall be commenced until the permittee shall file
with the City Secretary and maintain in current status sufficient security in
the form of a bond or certificate of deposit approved for form by the City
Attorney, or cash in lieu of the full amount of the bond, in such principal sum
as determined by the City Manager or the City Council, but to be not less than
the aggregate sum of $50,000.00.  Any such bond posted as required herein shall
consist of a $5,000.00 cash bond and the remaining $45,000.00 in the form of a
surety bond executed by a reliable insurance company authorized to do business
in the State of Texas as surety, and with the permittee as principle, running
to the city for the benefit of the city and all persons concerned.  In lieu of
the surety portion of the bond, any certificate of deposit filed as permitted
herein shall be free of any prior claim or obligation and shall not be pledged
as security for any other purposes save and except as specified herein.  In no
instance, however, shall there be less than a $5,000.00 cash bond posted as
part of the total security.  Any such bond or other security pledged as
required herein shall be effective on or before the date it is filed with the
City Secretary and remain in force and effect for a period of at least six
months subsequent to the expiration of the term of the permit issued herein.
(b)   Supplemental security.  If the proceeds of the $5,000.00 cash bond or
other security required herein shall be applied to remedy noncompliance as
provided in Section 61-90 of this chapter, the permittee shall be required to
immediately provide additional security of a like kind to maintain at all times
the level of security as required under this chapter.  Failure to maintain
security at all times as required under this chapter shall constitute cause for
revocation of permit as provided in Section 61-91 of this chapter.
(c)   Additional security.  If at any time the City Manager or the City Council
shall deem any permittee's bond or other security to be insufficient, the
manager or the City Council may require the permittee to file a new bond or
additional security.
(d)   Conditions of security.  Any security filed as required under the
provisions of this section shall be conditioned, on penalty of forfeiture or
partial forfeiture to the city without written notice, on the following:
   (1)   that permittee shall comply with all of the terms and conditions of
this chapter;
   (2)   that permittee shall promptly pay all fines, penalties or other
assessments imposed upon permittee by reason of permittee's breach of any of
the terms, provisions and conditions of this chapter;
   (3)   that permittee shall remedy any and all damage to streets, curbs,
gutters, water lines, fire hydrants and other property of the city, occasioned
in any manner by permittee or its drilling, operation, and abandonment of said
well;
   (4)   that permittee shall promptly fulfill all obligations under this
chapter, and shall conduct the drilling operations in full conformance with the
requirements herein, including, but not limited to, abatement of dust and dirt,
removal of mud from public streets and thoroughfares, watering of non-paved
access roads, timely construction and erection of all fence structures as
required herein, and other similar terms and provisions;
   (5)   that permittee shall promptly clear all premises of all litter, trash,
waste and other substances used, allowed or occurring in the drilling or
producing operations, and shall, after abandonment, grade, level, and restore
said property in conformance with the city's drainage control ordinance;
   (6)   that permittee shall in all things fulfill the requirements of the
site plan, and if required, any reclamation or restoration of the site stated
as a condition of the issuance of the permit;
   (7)   that permittee shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and
all liability growing out of or attributable to the granting of this permit or
any of permittee's actions with respect to the drilling, operation, and
abandonment of said well.
(e)   Reduction in principal amount.  If after completion of a well, the
permittee has complied with all the provisions of this chapter, such as
removing the derrick, clearing the premises, etc., the permittee may apply to
the city to have the bond or other security reduced to a sum of not less than
$10,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces; provided, however,
that the permittee has met all the requirements of any permit hereunder, has
otherwise acted in full compliance with this chapter, and provided that the
permittee shall submit a bond or certificate of deposit in the correct
principal amount and approved for form by the City Attorney, or cash in lieu
thereof, and otherwise in conformance with the provisions of this section as a
substitute for any other security previously pledged under the provisions of
subsection 61-33(a) herein, save and except that no such substitute shall be
taken for the $5,000.00 cash bond until such time as otherwise specified in
this ordinance.  Permittee may provide a blanket bond or certificate of deposit
in the approved form specified herein, or cash in lieu thereof, in the
principal amount of not less than $10,000.00 per well secured by said security,
to a maximum principal amount of said security of $50,000.00, said blanket
security to secure all wells operated by the permittee within the city limits
of the city provided said blanket security is in a form acceptable to the City
Attorney and otherwise conforms with the requirements of this section.
(f)   For each completed well covered by security under this section that
ceases to produce and is subsequently plugged and abandoned in accordance with
the requirements of the Texas Railroad Commission, the security for said well
shall be returned to the principal or in the case of blanket security, said
well shall no longer require such security. To qualify for release of security
as set out herein, the permittee must provide copies of official Texas Railroad
Commission forms verifying the plugging and abandonment of the well and must
remove all surface equipment used in the operation of the well including, but
not limited to, pumps, compressors, storage tanks, and separator tanks.
(g)   Violation of conditions.  It shall be unlawful for the principal of any
bond filed in accordance with this section to violate any condition of such
bond.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-34.  Insurance required prior to drilling.
(a)   Generally.  In addition to the bond required by Section 61-33, each
permittee, prior to the issuance of the permit and commencement of actual
drilling operations, shall file with the City Secretary a certificate or
certificates of insurance showing that the permittee has in full force and
effect a policy or policies of standard comprehensive public liability
insurance, including contractual liability covering bodily injuries and
property damage, naming the permittee and the city as co-insured, and issued by
an insurance company authorized to do business within the State of Texas.  Such
policy or policies, in the aggregate shall provide for the following minimum
coverage:
   (1)   for bodily injury or death, $500,000.00 as to any one person and
$1,000,000.00 as to any one accident.
   (2)   for public liability for damage to property of others, $500,000.00.
(b)   In addition, prior to the issuance of the permit, permittee shall file
with the City Secretary a certificate or certificates of insurance showing that
the permittee has in full force and effect a policy or policies of blowout or
cost of well control insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00 for
each well.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-35.  Notification of issuance.
Following the issuance of a permit as otherwise provided herein, the applicant
shall place a notification of such issuance in the legal notice section of the
local newspaper with the largest daily circulation in the city.  Such
notification shall be published no earlier than three days following the
issuance of the permit and no later than five days following the issuance of
the permit.  Said notification shall state with particularity the name of the
permittee; the designated name of the well; the well location, identified by
streets and other readily identifiable landmarks sufficient to inform the
reader as to the exact location of the well; the anticipated date for drilling
activity to begin; and any other specific information required to be published
by the city.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-36.  Permit term.
Each permit issued under this ordinance shall be effective for an initial term
of 90 days from the date of issuance; provided, however, that said permit shall
be issued for a shorter period of time co-extensive with the shortest duration
for any waiver required for approval of the permit.  Two time extensions of 45
days each may be granted at the end of the original 90 day term, again subject
to a shorter duration for any waiver, and provided the permittee can make a
showing of good cause for the delay as a precondition for approval of any
extension.  The City Manager or his duly authorized designee shall determine
the appropriateness of any permit extension.  It shall be the responsibility of
the permittee to file any requests for extension at least five days in advance
of the expiration date of the then-outstanding term.  At the end of the initial
term, or any extended term not to exceed a total of 180 days, the permit shall
expire and the permittee must reapply for a new permit.  Any decision not to
grant a permit extension as provided herein may be appealed by the permittee to
City Council, which such decision shall be final.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-37.  Completion of well.
Upon completion of the well, including performance of all production tests
required by the Texas Railroad Commission as a precondition to issuance of a
production allowable, the permittee shall verbally notify the oil and gas
inspector as soon as possible thereafter, and shall formally certify completion
of the well to the city by filing duplicates of Texas Railroad Commission
required completion forms G-1 (gas well) or W-2 (oil well), or their successor
forms, with the city within ten days following the filing of same with the
Texas Railroad Commission.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-38.  Refusal or withdrawal of permit; processing fee.
If the permit for the well be refused, or if the applicant notifies the city in
writing that the applicant does not elect to accept the permit as tendered and
wishes to withdraw the application, or if the bond of the applicant be not
approved, or if the applicant notifies the city in writing that the applicant
wishes to withdraw the application, or if following the issuance of the permit,
the permittee determines that drilling of the well is no longer feasible or
possible, and the permittee has undertaken no substantive activity in drilling
the well to date, then upon the happening of one or more of said events the
cash deposit filed by the applicant with the application shall be returned to
the applicant, except there shall be retained therefrom by the city a
processing fee set by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93; Ord. No. 3242, § 7, 8-28-03)
Sec. 61-39.  Transfer of permit.
Upon application for transfer of permit duly presented to the oil and gas
inspector, and upon stipulation in writing by the applicant for transfer to
assume all obligations of the current permittee, including satisfactory
security, bonds, and insurance, and upon a showing that the applicant for
transfer would have otherwise been qualified for issuance of the original
permit, a permit may be transferred into the name of a new permittee.  A permit
transfer fee, set by resolution of the City Council, must accompany all
applications for a transfer.  Transfer of a permit shall not extend the term of
the original permit or affect any other substantive conditions or requirements
therein.  If for any reason an application for a transfer is rejected, the same
shall be treated as a request for withdrawal of the permit by the original
permittee unless the cause for rejection is timely cured or unless the original
permittee indicates in writing an intention to complete the well under the
existing permit.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93; Ord. No. 3242, § 8, 8-28-03)
Sec. 61-40.  Termination.
When a permit has been issued under this chapter, the same shall terminate and
become inoperative without any action on the part of the city, unless, within
the original term or extended term as set out in Section 61-36 of this chapter,
actual drilling of the well shall have commenced.  Thereafter the cessation of
drilling operations shall operate to terminate and cancel the permit, and the
well shall be considered as abandoned for all purposes of this chapter.  It
shall be unlawful thereafter to continue the operation or drilling of such well
without the issuance of another permit.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-41.  Supplemental permit for deepening well.
Once any well has either been completed as a producer or abandoned as a dry
hole, it shall be unlawful for any person to drill such well to a deeper depth
than that reached in the prior drilling operations without a supplemental
permit after filing a supplemental application with the City Secretary
specifying:
(1)   the then-condition of the well and the casing therein;
(2)   the depth to which it proposed such well be deepened;
(3)   the proposed casing program to be used in connection with the proposed
deepening operation; and
(4)   evidence of adequate current tests showing that the casing strings in the
well meet or exceed all regulatory requirements of the Texas Railroad
Commission.
In the event the oil and gas inspector, and the entity originally approving the
permit, the same being either the City Manager or the City Council, is
satisfied that the well may be deepened with the same degree of safety as
existed in the original well, a supplemental permit may be issued without
additional filing fee to the permittee authorizing the deepening and operation
of the well to such specified depth as applied for.  In any deeper drilling or
any deeper completion of any deeper producing operations, the permittee shall
comply with all other provisions contained in this chapter and the original
permit applicable to the drilling, completion, and operation of a well.

Sec. 61-52.  Permitting procedure.
(a)   The applicant shall cooperate fully with the oil and gas inspector in
providing all information necessary to complete the permit application.  Upon
completion of the review of the permit application, the oil and gas inspector
shall make a recommendation to the City Manager as to whether a Level A Permit
should issue.  If the City Manager determines that the application complies in
all respects with the provisions of this chapter, the City Manager shall issue
a permit for the drilling and operation of the well.
(b)   The City Manager shall act on an application for a Level A Permit within
30 days after all information required for issuance of the permit has been
filed with the oil and gas inspector.  The 30 day review period shall not begin

complete application package, including satisfaction of the requirements of
Section 61-30 of this chapter regarding timely posting of the required notice
sign.
(c)   In reviewing the permit application, the oil and gas inspector and the
City Manager may consider the past performance of the applicant in compliance
with city ordinances regulating oil and gas drilling activity.  Should the
applicant have a history of poor compliance, such that the City Manager
believes that a subsequent permit would necessitate a more intense site plan,
additional conditions, or other similar requirements, then the City Manager
may, within ten days of receipt of a completed application, determine that the
pending application should require a Level B or Level C Permit.  Thereafter,
the permit shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
regarding issuance of such permits; the time period for issuance of such
permits shall begin on the date of the City Manager's recommendation or the
date of perfection of a permit application for the recommended permit,
whichever date shall occur later.
(d)   Based on the applicant's prior compliance and other considerations as set
out in subsection (c) above, the City Manager may also require as a condition
of issuance of the permit increased security or insurance coverage in excess of
that specified in Section 61-33 and Section 61-34 of this chapter.
(e)   The City Manager may impose any special conditions in the permit deemed
appropriate to achieve the purposes of this ordinance and to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city.
(f)   The City Manager, upon a finding that the application fails to comply
with the requirements of this chapter or should not be approved for the reasons
stated in Sections 61-33 and 61-34 of this chapter, may deny the permit.
(Ord. No. 2272, § 1, 1-26-93)
Sec. 61-53.  Permit conditions.
(a)   Each Level A Permit issued under this article shall include the
following:
   (1)   by reference have incorporated therein all the provisions of this

in the permit.
   (2)   specify the well location with particularity to lot number, block
number, name of addition or subdivision, or other available correct legal
description, as indicated on the minimum site plan; provided, however, the
exact wellhead location for a Level A Permit may vary by 20 feet in either
direction from the originally indicated survey point as long as such variance
does not require the approval of adjacent property owners as set out in Section
61-32 of this chapter.  If the site location does vary from that originally
presented to the oil and gas inspector, the permittee shall upon completion of
the well, file with the oil and gas inspector a revised site plan indicating
the actual location of the wellhead.
   (3)   specify the term of the permit in conformance with the requirements of
Section 61-36 of this chapter.
   (4)   specify minimum driveway requirements in conformance with the
provisions of Section 61-11 of this chapter.

the permittee shall file and have approved security in the designated principal
amount set out in the permit and conditioned as specified in Section 61-33 of
this chapter.

or as are required by the City Manager.
(b)   The permit shall be in duplicate originals signed by the City Manager,
and prior to delivery to the permittee, shall be signed by the permittee with
one original to be retained by the city and one by the permittee.  When so
signed such permit shall constitute the permittee's drilling and operating
license and a contractual obligation of the permittee to comply with the terms
of such permit, such bond, and this chapter.

Sec. 61-54.  Appeal by the permit applicant.
The actions of the City Manager in imposing additional conditions in excess of
the minimum conditions required under this chapter for the issuance of the
permit, or the City Manager's denial of the permit application, may be appealed
by the permit applicant in public session to the City Council.  In considering
the appeal, the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, and the standard
for review of the City Manager's actions shall be the same as set out in
Section 61-72(h) herein for review of a Level C Permit application.  Following
the appeal, the City Council may sustain the action of the City Manager,
reverse same, or impose additional requirements as conditions for issuance of

applicant's prior poor compliance with the city's ordinances, or by reason of
the fact that the well location would impose an unreasonable burden or unduly
damage the surface of the proposed location, including especially park land,
and there are alternative sites available for such well location, or for health
or safety reasons, or for a composite of any of these reasons, or others, the
drilling or operation of such well in the particular location might be
injurious or a disadvantage to the city or to its inhabitants, especially
adjacent property owners; or the City Council may grant a permit upon such
terms and conditions as the City Council determines to be necessary to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare.

shall not be subject to this article or payment of the same fees and fines,
except that each governmental unit and taxing entity shall be required to
obtain an alarm permit.
(Ord. No. 3075, § 2, 10-25-01; Ord. No. 3171, § 2, 12-12-02; Ord. No. 3907, §
2, 12-12-13)
Sec. 70-54.   Duties of alarm user.
(a)   An alarm user shall:
   (1)   maintain the premises and the alarm system in a manner that will
minimize or eliminate false alarms; and
   (2)   not manually activate an alarm system for any reason other than an
occurrence of an event that the alarm system was intended to report; and
   (3)   operate the alarm system only if the system is functioning properly. 
If the alarm coordinator determines that false alarm notifications are related
to a defect or malfunction in the alarm system, the alarm coordinator may
require the alarm user to produce a written report from a properly licensed
alarm company which has inspected the alarm system stating the probable cause
of false alarms and actions taken or recommendations for eliminating the false
alarms; and
   (4)   make every reasonable effort to respond or cause a representative to
respond to the alarm site within 30 minutes of being notified of an alarm
activation.  The failure of an alarm user or representative to respond to an
alarm site after being notified of an alarm activation may result in the
forfeiture of the alarm users' right to appeal, a determination by the
responding officer(s) that an alarm was false and any service fee assessed as a
result of the alarm activation.
(b)   An alarm user shall adjust the mechanism or cause the mechanism to be
adjusted so that an alarm signal audible on the exterior of an alarm site will
sound for no longer than 15 minutes.
(c)   An alarm user of an alarm system that emits an alarm signal that is
audible or visible from the exterior of a structure shall adjust, or cause to
be adjusted, the alarm system so that upon activation, the alarm system will
not transmit another signal without first being reset.
(d)   An alarm user shall not operate an alarm system, as defined in this
article, which uses an automatic dialing device to summon police.
(e)   An alarm user shall maintain at each alarm site, a set of written
operating instructions for each alarm system.

Sec. 70-55.   Duties of the alarm company.
(a)   Prior to alarm system activation, every alarm company selling, leasing or

   (2)   furnish the user with an application for an alarm user's permit;
   (3)   provide written instructions explaining how to operate the alarm
system properly;
   (4)   provide written information on how to obtain service for the alarm
system at any time; and

the alarm user as authorized to operate the alarm system.
(b)   Upon enactment of this ordinance, alarm companies shall not install a
device activating a robbery alarm system that is a single action non-recessed
button.  An alarm company must remove all single action non-recessed buttons
when a takeover or conversion occurs.
(c)   Each alarm company shall provide to the alarm coordinator a copy of its
state license and the name, address and phone number of a contact person.  If
the alarm company has a local contact person, then the name, address and phone
number shall be provided to the alarm coordinator.
(d)   An alarm company which begins monitoring a previously unmonitored alarm
system or an alarm system previously monitored by another alarm company must
notify the alarm coordinator of the conversion at least three days prior to the
date of the conversion.
(e)   An alarm company or any person performing monitoring shall:
   (1)   attempt to verify an alarm signal from a burglary alarm system before
requesting a police response;
   (2)   communicate cancellations to the police department as soon as possible
following the determination that a police response is unnecessary;
   (3)   communicate the type of alarm activation (silent or audible; robbery,
burglary or duress; exterior or interior motion, etc.);
   (4)   communicate any available information about the specific location of
the alarm at the alarm site;
   (5)   endeavor to contact the alarm user or a representative when an alarm
notification is made and notify the police department of the time contact was
made or the lack thereof, and the intent of the alarm user or representative to
respond or to not respond to the alarm site.  The alarm company shall also
furnish the police department with the name of the person contacted, the name
of the person responding, the estimated time of arrival and a description of
the vehicle driven by the responding person, if applicable.
   (6)   provide the police department with any other information about the
alarm and alarm site that may be deemed necessary for the safety of responding
officer(s) and administering this article.
(f)   The alarm coordinator may appeal to the Texas Department of Public Safety
Private Security Bureau to suspend or revoke an alarm company's license for
failure to comply with the duties listed in this section.
(Ord. No. 3075, § 2, 10-25-01; Ord. No. 3907, § 2, 12-12-13)
Sec. 70-56.  False alarms; service fees.
(a)   All alarm notifications requiring a police response are characterized as
being either a legitimate alarm or a false alarm after inspection of the alarm

      f.   other situations where it is determined by the alarm coordinator
that the alarm user could not have reasonably prevented the alarm activation.
   (2)   The following situations are considered to be false alarms and are
chargeable to the alarm user if the police department responds to the alarm
site within 30 minutes of the alarm notification:
      a.   business alarms that are accidentally activated by an employee,
owner, cleaning crew or other persons legally at the alarm site; and
residential alarms that are accidentally activated by the homeowner, occupant,
or person who is legally at the residence.
      b.   alarms activated as a result of a domestic animal.
      c.   alarms activated due to heating or air conditioning blowers turning
on or due to the operation of other mechanical or electrical devices left

      d.   alarms activated due to falling stock or movement of hanging signs
or other objects.
      e.   alarms activated as a result of a malfunction in the alarm system.
      f.   alarms caused by any other condition that could have been reasonably
prevented by the alarm user.
(b)   An alarm user shall be subject to service fees and possible permit
suspension for an excessive number of false alarms at their alarm site.
   (1)   No service fee will be charged for the first three false alarms
occurring in a calendar year at an alarm site.
   (2)   Except as provided in Section 70-58 of this article, after the first
three alarms at an alarm site in a calendar year, an alarm user shall pay a
service fee for each false alarm occurring at their alarm site during the
remainder of the twelve-month period.
(c)   A service fee for false alarms may be imposed if a least three false
alarms have occurred in the preceding 12-month period.  The amount of the
service fee for a false alarm will be established as follows:
   (1)   $50, if the location has had more than three, but fewer than six other
false alarms in the preceding 12-month period; or
   (2)   $75, if the location has had more than five, but fewer than eight
other false alarms in the preceding 12-month period; or
   (3)   $100, if the location has had eight or more other false alarms in the
preceding 12-month period.
(d)   Upon the determination that six or more false alarms have occurred at an
alarm site in a calendar year, the alarm coordinator shall make written notice
to the alarm user and the alarm company providing service of such fact and the
service fee(s) assessed.  The notice shall also state that the user must either
appeal, as provided in Section 70-58 of this article, or pay the assessed
service fee(s) within 30 days of receipt of the notice.  Failure to make timely
payment of fees shall result in the alarm permit being revoked.
(Ord. No. 3075, § 2, 10-25-01; Ord. No. 3907, § 2, 12-12-13)
Sec. 70-57.   Alarm permit suspension and revocation; reinstatement.
(a)   The alarm coordinator may suspend an alarm permit if it is determined
that:
   (1)   the alarm user failed to notify the alarm coordinator of any change
that alters any information listed on the permit application within five
business days, pursuant to Section 70-53(a)(6) of this article; or
   (2)   the alarm user failed on one or more occasions to comply with the
provisions specified in Section 70-54 of this article.
(b)   The alarm coordinator may revoke an alarm permit if it is determined
that:
   (1)   there is a false statement of a material matter or misrepresentation
in the alarm permit application;
   (2)   the permit holder has failed to make timely payment of a service fee
assessed under this article; or
   (3)   following reinstatement of the permit after suspension, there has been
an additional occurrence, in the same calendar year, of the violation(s) that
resulted in the previous suspension of the permit.
(c)   An alarm permit that has been revoked or suspended may be reinstated if
the alarm user:
   (1)   submits an updated, accurate permit application and, if revoked, pays
a nonrefundable reinstatement fee equal to the fee required for the issuance of
a new permit;
   (2)   pays, or otherwise resolves, all fees and fines assessed under this
article; and/or
   (3)   provides acceptable evidence that the cause(s) of the suspension or
revocation has been remedied.  A finding in favor of the alarm user pursuant to
the appeal process provided for in Section 70-58 of this article is considered
to be acceptable evidence.
(d)   An alarm user shall immediately discontinue use of an alarm system upon
being notified of the suspension or revocation of an alarm permit.  It is
unlawful for an alarm user to continue use of an alarm system after notice of
suspension or revocation of the alarm permit.
(Ord. No. 3075, § 2, 10-25-01; Ord. No. 3907, § 2, 12-12-13)
Sec. 70-58.   Appeals
(a)   An alarm user may appeal a false alarm determination and/or assessment of
a service fee by filing a written notice of appeal to the alarm coordinator
within five business days of receipt of the notice that a service fee(s) has
been assessed.
   (1)   The notice of appeal must state the date of the alarm being disputed
and the reasons why the alarm user believes the false alarm determination to be
incorrect.
   (2)   The alarm coordinator will make a determination in writing within five
business days of receipt of the notice of appeal.
   (3)   The determination of the alarm coordinator may be appealed to the
Police Chief if the appeal is made in writing within five business days of
receipt of the alarm coordinator's findings.  If the Police Chief determines
that eight or more false alarms have occurred during the preceding 12-month
period, at the alarm site, the alarm permit shall be revoked unless the false
alarm fee(s) are paid.  The decision of the Police Chief is final.
(b)   Except for revocations following an appeal as provided for in subsection
(a) of this Section 70-58, an alarm user may appeal the suspension or
revocation of an alarm permit to the Police Chief by filing a written request
for a hearing within ten days of receipt of the notification of permit
suspension or revocation.
   (1)   If a hearing before the Police Chief is requested, the alarm
coordinator shall notify the alarm user by certified mail of the time and place
of the hearing at least five days prior to the hearing date, which date shall
be not less than ten days after the filing of the request for a hearing.
   (2)   At the hearing, the alarm user may present written and oral evidence
as to the reasons the permit should not be suspended or revoked.  The formal
rules of evidence do not apply at an appeal hearing and the Alarm Coordinator
may present any records or other evidence deemed probative by the Police Chief
or Alarm Coordinator.
   (3)   The Police Chief shall make a decision to uphold or overturn the

completed by those persons authorized in this section to conduct same under the
following circumstances:
   (a)   prior to providing continuous water service to new construction;
   (b)   on any existing service when the Backflow Protection Program manager
or his designee, in his sole discretion and opinion, has reason to believe that
cross connections or other unacceptable plumbing practices exist;
   (c)   for any material improvement, correction, or addition to private
plumbing facilities as determined by the City Manager or the City Manager’s
designee.
608.15.2  Qualified Inspectors.  The following individuals shall be and are
hereby authorized to conduct customer service inspection certifications within
the City of Longview, in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof:
   (a)   city plumbing inspectors, who have received all necessary state-
required certifications, endorsements and licenses;
   (b)   licensed master plumbers, who have received all necessary state-
required certifications, endorsements and licenses, upon specific written
authorization of the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee, and only for
such inspections on single-family residential services;
   (c)   Individuals who have completed a TCEQ approved Customer Service
Inspection course and passed the required examination and hold current
certification or endorsement as a Customer Service Inspector.
608.15.3  Unacceptable Practices to be Eliminated.  When unacceptable plumbing
practices are discovered, they shall be promptly eliminated to prevent possible
contamination of the city water system.  The existence of a serious threat to
the integrity of the public water supply shall be considered sufficient grounds
for immediate termination of water service.  Service can be restored only when
the source of potential contamination no longer exists, or until sufficient
additional safeguards have been taken.
608.15.4  Required Certifications.  Copies of properly completed customer
service inspection certifications shall be kept on file by the Backflow
Prevention program manager or his designee.  All such certifications shall be
maintained for a minimum of ten (10) years.  The City Manager or the City
Manager’s designee shall prepare appropriate certification forms.  All such
forms shall include as a minimum the name and registration number of the
inspector performing the inspection, the type of registration, the date of the
inspection, and the signature of the inspector.  As a minimum, each such form
shall include the following certifications and information, as applicable:
   (a)   No direct connection between the public drinking water supply and a
potential source of contamination exists.  Potential sources of contamination
are isolated from the public water system by an air gap or appropriate backflow
prevention assembly in accordance with state plumbing regulations. 
Additionally, all pressure relief valves and thermal expansion devices are in
compliance with state plumbing codes.
   (b)   No cross connection between the city drinking water supply and a
private water source exists.  Where an actual air gap is not maintained between
the public water supply and a private water supply, an approved reduced
pressure-zone backflow prevention assembly is properly installed and a service
agreement exists for annual inspection and testing by a recognized backflow
prevention assembly tester.
   (c)   No connection exists which would allow the return of water used for
condensing, cooling or industrial processes back to the public water supply.

state approved plumbing code.
608.15.5  Backflow Protection Required. No water connection from the city’s
water supply system shall be allowed to any residence or establishment where an
actual or potential contamination hazard exists unless the public water
facilities are protected from contamination.
   (a)   Air Gap or Backflow Prevention Assembly Required; Inspection Required.
At any residence or establishment where an actual or potential contamination
hazard exists, additional protection shall be required at the meter in the form
of an air gap or backflow prevention assembly.  The type of backflow prevention
assembly required shall be as specified  in state law, including without
limitation the rules promulgated by the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (or the state agency having appropriate jurisdiction).
   (b)   Internal Cross Connection Control Program; Inspection Required. At any
residence or establishment where an actual or potential contamination hazard
exists and an adequate internal cross-connection control program is in effect,
backflow protection at the water service entrance or meter is not required.  An
adequate internal cross-connection control program must protect the public
water supply in accordance with the requirements set forth by the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (or the state agency having appropriate
jurisdiction) and must include annual inspection and testing in accordance with
Section 608.15.6 below.
608.15.6  Testing of Backflow Prevention Assemblies; Report.
   (a)    Testing Required.  All required backflow prevention assemblies shall
be tested upon installation by a recognized backflow prevention assembly tester
and certified to be operating within specifications.  Additionally, all such
backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested and certified to be operating
within specifications at least annually by a recognized backflow prevention
assembly tester. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the plumbing code,
annual testing by a recognized backflow prevention assembly tester shall not be
required for backflow prevention assemblies that are used solely with
residential irrigation systems without chemical additives; provided, however,
that all required backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested upon
installation as required by this section.
   (b)   Test and Maintenance Report.  A test and maintenance report must be
completed by the recognized backflow prevention assembly tester for each
assembly tested in accordance with this Section 608.15.6.  All such reports

subsection (a) of this Section 608.15.6, and the signature of the tester.  Such
reports must also contain the information required by Section 608.15.8 below
and any additional information required by the City Manager’s designee.  Such
reports must be in a form acceptable to said designee.
   (c)   Due Date.  Upon installation of a backflow prevention assembly, a
signed and dated original of the test and maintenance report shall be filed
with the City Manager’s designee within the time limit set by said designee. 
Thereafter, the annual test and maintenance report required by this Section
608.15.6 shall be filed with the City Manager’s designee on or before October 1
of each year.  The date of the inspection and testing evidenced by such an
annual report must fall within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the
October 1 on which the report is due.
   (d)   Failure to File Report; Penalty.  The City Manager’s designee may
order the cut-off of water service to any residence or establishment in
violation of this Section 608.15.6.  Additionally, any water customer to whom
the requirements of this Section 608.15.6 apply may be punished by a fine of up
to $2,000.00 for the failure to comply with said section.
608.15.7 Recognized Backflow Prevention Assembly Testers.  Recognized backflow
prevention assembly testers shall have completed a course on cross-connection
control and backflow prevention assembly testing, passed a test administered by
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (or the state agency having
appropriate jurisdiction) or its designated agent, and hold a current
professional certification as a backflow prevention assembly tester.  Any
course taken to satisfy the requirements of this section must be a course
approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (or the state agency
having appropriate jurisdiction).

used in the testing of backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested for
accuracy annually in accordance with the requirements of the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality (or the state agency having appropriate
jurisdiction).  Backflow prevention assembly testers must include test gauge
serial numbers on each test and maintenance report form filed with the city in
accordance with Section 608.15.6.  On each such form, the backflow prevention
assembly tester shall certify that each gauge used in the production of the
report form meets the requirements of the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (or the state agency having appropriate jurisdiction) and has been
tested within the last year in accordance with the requirements of this Section
608.15.8.

General Provisions
Sec. 85-1.   Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide uniform sign regulations for the City

thereby promote the public health, safety and welfare. Its provisions shall be
held to be the minimum requirements in the installation, erection, location,

Static off-premise signs and similar outdoor advertising, excluding directory
signs, are prohibited within the City of Longview except in commercial and
industrial zoing districts and only on a two (2) to one (1) removal/replacement
basis where twice the amount of proposed square footage of sign area must be
removed through the demolition/removal of an existing static off-premise sign
(s). All static off-premise signs constructed after the enactment of this
chapter must meet all Federal, State, and City requirements and must also meet
the following requirements: 
(a)   A static off-premise sign shall not exceed a maximum overall height of
thirty-five (35) feet, measured from the highest point of the sign to ground
level.
(b)   A static off-premise sign shall not be located so as to create a safety
hazard, or to obscure or otherwise interfere with the effectiveness of an
official traffic sign, signal or device, or obstruct the driver's view of
approaching, merging or intersecting traffic, or to be likely to cause a driver
to be unduly distracted in any way.
(c)   A static off-premise sign shall not be located within 1,500 feet of any
residentially zoned district, public park, public forest, public playground or
scenic area, designated as such by the city or any other governmental agency.
(d)   The gross sign area of a static off-premise sign shall be calculated by
calculating the area enclosed within the outer edge of the frame (border) of
each sign face panel and then calculating the sum of the areas for all sign
face panels on the sign.
(e)   The maximum sign area for any one (1) sign face panel of a static off-
premise sign shall not exceed four hundred (400) square feet in size.
(f)   The minimum separation shall be three thousand (3,000) feet from any
other static off-premise sign. Separation between static off-premise signs
shall be measured from the nearest points of each static off-premise sign to
one another. 
(g)   A static off-premise sign shall be supported by a single pole.
(h)   Double-faced billboards shall maintain the same sign face panel
dimensions on both sides.
(i)   If illuminated, a static off-premise sign shall be lighted only by lights
which are properly installed, shaded or concealed, and are aimed so that the
light will project onto the sign face and will not interfere with the vision of
motor vehicle operators, nor shine directly onto nearby residential property
located in any residentially zoned district.
(j)   A static off-premise sign shall be considered a structure and shall
observe all setbacks and structure separation requirements of the zoning
district in which they are located.
(Ord. No. 3240, § 4, 8-28-03; Ord. No. 3264, § 10, 10-9-03; Ord. No. 4240, § 2,
10-10-19)
Digital off-premise sign specifications.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, digital off-premise
signs are prohibited.  A static off-premise sign is allowed to be retrofitted
with a digital sign face panel on an existing pole inside the city limits of
Longview when all of the following criteria are met:
(a)   Only those existing off-premise signs located along the Loop 281 and
Marshall Ave./Hwy 80 Corridors with a zoning classification of Commercial (C1
and C2), Industrial (I1 and I2) or Commercial and Industrial Planned
Development (PD) that allow for billboards are eligible for retrofit.  Each of
the aforementioned corridors shall be defined as the land area within 500 feet
of the right-of-way of the named roadway.
(b)   A static off-premise sign shall not be retrofitted to become a digital
off-premise sign within 1500 ft. of another existing digital off-premise sign
along Marshall Ave./Hwy 80 and 2800 ft. along Loop 281 corridors.  For purposes
of this subsection, the distance between signs on the same side of the roadway
shall be measured along and parallel to the roadway from the existing sign to
the nearest point on the proposed sign.  For signs on opposite sides of the
roadway, the distance between signs shall be measured along and parallel to the
roadway from the existing sign to the nearest point on the same side of the
roadway that is located on a line perpendicular to the roadway that passes
through the site of the proposed sign and then along that perpendicular line to
the nearest point on the proposed sign.  For signs within one of the allowed
corridors but located along a cross-street rather than on the street after
which the corridor is named, the distance shall be measured along and parallel
to the roadway from the existing sign to the cross-street (or, if the existing
sign is located along the cross-street, to the street after which the corridor
is named) and then along and parallel to the other street to the nearest point
on the proposed sign.  If a street must be crossed in making such a
measurement, the distance shall be measured by incorporating the perpendicular
line method described in this subsection.
(c)   The sign being retrofitted to become a digital off-premise sign shall be
on an existing single pole with engineering to support the digital retrofit. 
The retrofitted sign may not contain more than 2 sign face panels back to
back.  The sign face panels may be parallel or in the shape of a "V", but no
point on the back of each sign face panel shall be more than 15 feet from the
corresponding point on the other sign face panel.
(d)   A static off-premise sign may be located on either side of a roadway;
however, each sign must only be visible from one direction of travel; i.e.,
signs must be perpendicular to roadway, not including allowable "V"-shaped
signs.
(e)   Four (4) static sign face panels shall be removed for every one (1)
digital sign face panel to be retrofitted.  This will include the static sign
face panel that is being replaced with the digital sign face panel.  For
purposes of satisfying this requirement to remove four (4) static sign face
panels, a sign face panel of a changeable copy sign that is a legal,
nonconforming off-premise sign may be treated as a static sign face panel.
   Example:  The sign face panel that wil be retrofitted to digital plus three
(3) additional sign face panels shall be removed.
(f)   The maximum sign area for a digital sign face panel shall not exceed four
hundred (400) square feet in size.
(g)   The total square footage of the four sign face panels being removed shall
total a minimum of 1200 square feet.
(h)   Double-faced billboards shall maintain the same dimension of sign face
panel on both sides.  If an existing billboard is being retrofitted with a
digital sign face panel in which a larger billboard is on the opposite side,
that larger sign face panel must also be retrofitted with a new static sign
face panel to match the size of the digital sign face panel.  This would count
as one of the sign face panels for removal, nor will it affect the non-
conforming status of the sign.
Digital off-premise sign retrofit procedures
A static off-premise sign may be retrofitted with a digital sign face panel
following the procedures below:
(a)   A demolition permit shall be obtained from the Building Inspection
division for the complete removal of an off-premise sign in order to be counted
towards the sign face panels that are removed to satisfy the requirements of
this section.
(b)   Off-premise sign(s) and pole(s) shall be completely demolished and
inspected for compliance with the demolition permit before a credit will be
issued for a new digital off-premise sign.  Conditional permits may be issued
to allow for TxDOT approval, but construction on the sign being retrofitted is
contingent upon the removal.
(c)   The registered owner of the off-premise sign will receive a credit for
the off-premise sign being removed if an immediate digital off-premise sign
retrofit is not planned.
(d)   Credits shall be valid until applied or until six (6) years from the date
of issuance of the credit, whichever occurs earlier.
(e)   Credits may be transferred with written notice to the Director of
Development Services within 30 days of a transfer.  Notice must be an affidavit
signed by all parties involved in the transfer of credits.
(f)   The Planning and Zoning division will maintain an inventory database of
all existing off-premise signs, removed off-premise signs, and credits obtained
by the registered owner of removed off-premise signs or through a transfer. 
The inventory database will be updated based on information obtained from the
off premise sign owners and other permit activity involved with the removal and
replacement of off-premise signs.
(g)   A digital sign face panel may be replaced with the same size digital sign
face panel when the operational life of the sign has expired.  Such maintenance
replacement of the digital sign panel shall not require the four (4) to one (1)
replacement for a new sign.
Digital off-premise sign operation
A digital off-premise sign shall adhere to all of the following regulations:
(a)   Messages shall have a minimum hold time of seven seconds between
transitions from one message to another.
(b)   A change of message shall be accomplished within two seconds.
(c)   A change of message shall occur simultaneously on the entire sign face.
(d)   A digital off-premise sign shall automatically adjust the intensity of
its display according to natural light conditions.
(e)   The owner of a digital off-premise sign shall coordinate with local
authorities to display, when appropriate, emergency information that has been
provided in the proper formats that are important to the traveling public. 
Emergency information messages shall remain in the advertising rotation
according to the protocols of the agency that issues the information.
(f)   The owner of a digital off-premise sign shall provide the Building
Inspection division contact information for someone who can be contacted at any
time and who is able to turn off the digital off-premise sign promptly after a
malfunction occurs.
(g)   Prohibitions.  A digital off-premise sign shall not:
   (1)   Be illuminated by flashing, intermittent, or moving lights;
   (2)   Contain or display animated, moving video, or scrolling advertising;
   (3)   Consist of a static image projected upon a stationary object.
(h)   A digital off-premise sign shall be equipped with light sensing devices
or a scheduled dimming timer that will automatically dim the intensity of the
light emitted by the sign during ambient low-light conditions and at night so
that the sign does not exceed the maximum brightness levels allowed in this
section.
(i)   Maximum brightness levels shall not exceed 7,000 nits when measured from
the sign face at its maximum brightness during daylight hours and 500 nits when
measured from the sign face at its maximum brightness at night.
(j)   Prior to the issuance of a permit for a digital off-premise sign
retrofit, the applicant shall provide written certification that the light
intensity will not exceed the levels specified in this section.
(k)   All new electrical shall be UL listed and labeled.
(l)   A digital off-premise sign shall contain a default mechanism that, in the
event a malfunction occurs, freezes the sign in one position, turns the sign
off, or causes the sign to display an unchanging blank screen.

eight feet or the maximum height allowed for any sign in the zoning district in
which the noncommercial sign is located, whichever is greater.  The maximum
surface area allowed for any noncommercial sign shall be either 36 square feet
or the maximum surface area allowed for any sign in the zoning district in
which the noncommercial sign is located, whichever is greater.  As to
illumination and moving elements, all noncommercial signs shall comply with the
least restrictive regulations applicable in the zoning district in which the
noncommercial sign is located.  Noncommercial signs attached to vehicles shall
comply with all regulations specifically applicable to vehicular signs.  All
noncommercial signs shall comply with all applicable provisions of Article II

An on-premise sign that is nonconforming shall immediately lost its
nonconforming designation and must be brought into compliance with this chapter
or be removed if any of the following occurs:
(a)    The sign is dismantled for any purpose other than maintenance operations
or for changing the letters, symbols, or other matter on the sign; or
(b)   the sign is damaged or deteriorated to a point where restoration cost
exceeds sixty (60) percent of the cost of erecting a new sign of the same type
at the same location.  In determining loss of nonconforming status, the cost of
erecting a new sign of the same type at the same location shall be determined
by a licensed sign contractor, selected by the city, at the owner’s expense.
Static off-premise signs.
A static off-premise sign that is nonconforming shall immediately lose its
nonconforming designation and must be brought into compliance with this chapter
or be removed if any of the following occurs:
(a)   The sign is dismantled for any purpose other than maintenance operations
or for changing the letters, symbols, or other advertising matter on the sign;
(b)   The sign is damaged or deteriorated to a poing where restoration cost
exceeds sixy (60) percent of the cost of a new sign of the same type at the
same location.  In determining loss of nonconforming status, the cost of

before placing any facilities within the public rights-of-way.
      a.   Pipeline license agreements. The City Manager or the City Engineer
may enter into pipeline license agreements with persons who wish to place
facilities within the public rights-of-way.  The Director of Public Works shall
determine a standard rate to charge per foot of the person's facilities placed

   (2)   the proposed activity will interfere with another activity for which a
permit has been previously issued; or
   (3)   the applicant is unable or not qualified to perform the proposed
activity; or
   (4)   the proposed activity will adversely impact the integrity of any
portion of the public rights-of-way; or
   (5)   the proposed activity will adversely impact existing or planned
facilities within the public rights-of-way; or

(j)   Restoration.  A person who makes or causes a cut or excavation within the
public rights-of-way must, as rapidly as practicable after the project is
completed, backfill the excavation or cut to a firm and solid bearing in a
manner that will prevent the settling of the earth, and must restore any base
and surface as near as possible to its former condition. Restoration work must
be completed to the satisfaction of the engineer.  The engineer may order the
removal of any backfill not completed to city specifications or to his
satisfaction.  Should the person making or causing an excavation or pavement
cut fail to backfill the same as required herein, the city may cause the same
to be done and shall charge the expense of such work to the person making or
causing such cut or excavation to be made.  However, such work shall not
release a person from the person's obligation under subsection (l).
(k)   Inspection. The city may inspect all work performed in accordance with a
permit issued pursuant to this ordinance.  A person holding a permit under this
section shall notify the city at least one hour prior to backfilling any
excavation.  The engineer may order additional work if he deems it to be
necessary.  Should additional work be ordered by the city, the holder of the
permit shall perform such work in accordance with orders.
(l)   Repair of defective work.  It shall be the duty of any person making or
causing replacement to do so in such a manner so as to prevent settlements in
the surface or in the paving over any such excavation or cut.  Should
settlement occur over a cut or excavation within a period of one year after the
surface or paving is replaced, it shall be the obligation of the person making
or causing the cut or excavation to pay the entire expense of correcting the
settlement, including but not limited to, all expenses of opening, refilling,
tamping, and repaving, and all other incidental work necessary to said
replacement in the opinion of the engineer, to prevent a future or continual
surface or paving settlement or failure.
(m)   Notice of defects.  The engineer shall notify any person making or
causing a cut or excavation of any settlement or pavement failure due to such
cut or excavation, giving said party five days from receipt of said
notification to observe and examine the condition therein referenced with the
engineer. If after ten days following said inspection, or within 15 days of
notification, if no such joint inspection is made, the party has not completed
the necessary repairs, the engineer may order the necessary repairs or
replacements to be performed and shall charge the expenses to the said party.
(n)   Warning devices.  Regardless of whether a permit is required under this
section, a person who undertakes any activity described by subsection (c) of
this section shall place barricades, warning signs, signal lights, or other
devices at the location, sufficient to warn the public of any hazard created by
the person's activity.  All such barricades, warning signs, signal lights, and
other necessary devices and their location and placement shall be in compliance
with the current edition of the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
for Streets and Highways.
(o)   Exemptions.
   (1)   Emergencies.  In the event of an emergency requiring an immediate cut
or excavation to be made, a person making or causing such cut or excavation
shall notify the engineer within 12 hours that the cut or excavation has been
made.  The person making the emergency repairs need not obtain a permit in
advance of making said repairs, but shall comply with all other applicable
provisions of this article.  The permit shall be obtained at the first
reasonable opportunity after such emergency repairs have commenced.
   (2)   Driveway construction.  A person is not required to obtain a permit
under this section if the person is only constructing a driveway and the person
holds a permit for construction of that driveway issued under a city ordinance
regulating driveway construction.  If a person is performing any work in
addition to driveway construction and the additional work would require a
permit under this section, then the person must obtain a permit under this
section in addition to any permit required under any applicable city
regulations relating to driveway construction.
   (3)   City.  The city, its' employees, and parties who have contracted for
street or public water, sewer, or storm sewer construction, repair, or
maintenance, shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
   (4)   State and federal highways.  The provisions of this ordinance shall

of-way, placement of proper barricades and warning devices, and repair of
substandard restoration work.
   (4)   The engineer may order that any work performed in the public rights-
of-way which is not in conformance with this ordinance be stopped immediately.
(q)   Appeals.  In the event a person disagrees with a decision of the engineer
concerning interpretation or enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance,
the person may appeal that decision to the Director of Public Works, who shall
make or cause an investigation of the circumstances of the appeal and shall
promptly render a decision thereon.  During the pendency of the appeal, the
person shall comply with all requirements of the engineer concerning use of
warning devices and all other safety regulations of the city.  The decision of
the Director of Public Works shall be final.

article.
Sec. 91-29.  Street names.
(a)   Street names required.  Street names shall be used to identify all
streets.
(b)   Naming of non-streets.  A street name shall not be assigned to anything
that is not a street as defined by this article unless the administrator
determines that the assignment of a street name is necessary to assist in
emergency response.  The assignment of a street name in such a circumstance
shall comply with this article.
(c)   Administrator approval required.  No street name shall be assigned unless
first approved by the administrator.
(d)   Naming process and criteria.  Assignment of street names shall be in
accordance with the following:
   (1)   If a plat is required under Chapter 92 of this code, proposed street
names shall be submitted to the administrator for review and approval at the
same time that the pre-submission proposal required by that chapter is
submitted.
   (2)   The administrator may require the submission of any proposed street
name or proposed change in a street name in any reasonable form, including
without limitation as a part of any required site plan or pre-submission
proposal.
   (3)   The duplication of street names shall not be permitted.
   (4)   Street names that sound or look alike so as to present a significant
potential for confusion shall not be permitted.
   (5)   Street names shall not contain any punctuation or special characters. 
Only alphabetical symbols A through Z and blank spaces may be used in street
names.
   (6)   If a new street is a direct or logical extension of an existing
street, the existing street name must be used in place of a newly assigned
name.
   (7)   Street names that are difficult to pronounce and difficult to spell
shall not be permitted.
   (8)   Streets bearing directional names shall not be permitted.
   (9)   Street names containing initials or abbreviations shall not be
permitted.
   (10)   Street names deemed controversial, improper, or obscene shall not be

   (11)   Street names that could lead to a high rate of vandalism or theft in
regards to the street’s designation sign shall not be permitted.
   (12)   Street names shall be a maximum of two words and 15 characters in
length.
   (13)   A street name shall not contain the given name and surname of a
person, either living or deceased, unless the street name is approved by the
City Council.
   (14)   Street directional prefixes shall not be permitted as part of the
street name.  Exceptions will be made when a street crosses one of the city’s
major dividing points such as Center Street (east/west divider), Green Street
(east/west divider), Judson Road (east/west divider), Pine Tree Road (east/west
divider), Marshall Avenue (north/south divider in Greggton area), and the Union
Pacific railroad tracks (north/south divider) that run parallel with Marshall
Avenue.
   (15)   When naming a new street, only the following classifications will be
considered in regards to the street suffix, and each street name shall be
assigned a suffix in conformance with the following definitions:
      (i)   Alley (AL) - A narrow street between clusters of buildings.  An
alley is normally accessed for utility purposes.
      (ii)   Avenue (AV) - A broad public street often lined with trees.  An
avenue provides ingress and egress from both ends, has wide lanes, and allows
for easy bi-directional traffic flow.
      (iii)   Boulevard (BL) - A broad, formally laid-out public street
normally four lanes wide and often lined with trees or adorned with landscaped
medians.  A boulevard provides ingress and egress from both ends and allows for
easy bi-directional traffic flow.  The suffix “boulevard” shall be assigned
only to a principal arterial, a minor arterial or a collector.
      (iv)   Circle (CL) - A circular-shaped street, sometimes a cul-de-sac,
for residences.  It can be either a closed loop or semicircle.  A circle often
returns to the same point of origin or to the same originating street,
therefore providing both ingress and egress.  A circle in a cul-de-sac scenario
has no egress and is longer in length than a court.
      (v)   Court (CT) - A circular pocket off a public street; a short street
with no streets running off of it (most commonly known as a cul-de-sac).  A
court has no egress and therefore forms a dead end.  It is shorter in length
than a circle, a lane, a place, or a way.
      (vi)   Drive (DR) - A residential street of local extent.  A drive
provides ingress and egress from both ends, normally has wide lanes, and allows
for easy bi-directional traffic flow.  The suffix “drive” shall be assigned
only to a principal arterial, a minor arterial or a collector.
      (vii)   Lane (LN) - A narrow, often informal street or passageway.  A
lane normally has no egress and therefore typically forms a dead end.  It is
generally longer in length than a court, a place, or a way and may have other
streets running off of it.
      (viii)   Loop (LP) - A circumferential street; a street that returns to
itself.  A loop has ingress and egress on the same street and normally contains
four or more lanes with adequate shoulder space.  The term is also used as a
prefix to a street name rather than as a suffix.  The suffix or prefix “loop”
shall be assigned only to a principal arterial meeting this definition.
      (ix)   Parkway (PK) - A broad, formally laid-out public street.  A
parkway typically contains four wide lanes, provides ingress and egress from
both ends, and allows for easy bi-directional traffic flow.  The suffix
“parkway” shall be assigned only to a principal arterial, a minor arterial or a
collector.
      (x)   Place (PL) - A short street.  A place normally has no egress and
therefore forms a dead end.  A place is longer in length than a court but
shorter than a lane.
      (xi)   Road (RD) - An open, public street that gives access to the
various parcels of land and to the various streets making up a community.  A
road has wide lanes, provides ingress and egress from both ends, and allows for
easy bi-directional traffic flow.
      (xii)   Square (SQ) - A rectangular-shaped street that typically accesses
residential developments.  A square provides ingress and egress from both ends.
      (xiii)   Street (ST) - For purposes of using the word “street” as a
suffix to a street name, a public street used to give vehicular traffic access
to the various parcels of land within a community.  The term may be used as a
street name suffix when the street has wide lanes, provides ingress and egress
from both ends, and allows for easy bi-directional traffic flow.
      (xiv)   Trail (TR) - A residential street.  A trail typically provides
ingress and egress from both ends, acting as a short connector street.  A trail
sometimes culminates in a dead end, though.  It normally has two full lanes but
is narrower than an avenue, drive, road, or street.
      (xv)   Way (WA) - A narrow street that is generally shorter in length
than a lane but longer than a court.  A way has no egress; therefore, it forms
a dead end.
      The definitions set forth in this subsection are to be used for purposes
of assigning the appropriate suffix to a street name and are not to be used in
otherwise construing the meaning of this article.
   (16)   In the event several streets located within a subdivision or area
form dead-end streets, each of the main streets shall be assigned the suffix
“lane,” “place,” or “way” with each dead-end street running off of it assigned
the suffix “court” or “circle.”
(e)   Change of street name.  The administrator may authorize or direct the
change of a street name.  Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
subsection (e), no street name change under these circumstances is valid unless
authorized by the administrator.  The administrator shall not authorize or
direct the change of any street name after any lot in the subdivision has been
sold or after the city has accepted dedication of the street, whichever occurs
first, unless the change is necessary to make the street name comply with the
requirements of this article.  Regardless of whether the change of a street
name is necessary to make the street name comply with the requirements of this
article, the City Council may authorize or direct the change of a street name
if the proposed new street name complies with the requirements of this article.
   If the city receives a request to change a street name after any lot in the
subdivision has been sold or after the city has accepted dedication of the
street, the City Council will consider the request only if it complies with the
following criteria:
   (1)   the majority of owners of property adjacent to the street for which a
street name change is requested agree in writing to the requested street name
change; and
   (2)   if the request asks that the street name be changed to the name of an
individual, the proposed new street name is the name of a deceased individual
of notable achievement.

addresses shall be submitted to the administrator for review and approval at
the same time that the pre-submission proposal required by that chapter is
submitted.  If a plat is not required but a site plan is required, then
proposed addresses shall be submitted to the administrator for review and
approval at the same time that  the site plan is submitted.  If neither a plat
nor a site plan is required, then any address required to be assigned under
this article shall be submitted before any new occupancy or change in occupancy
of the building or unit requiring an address.
   (2)   The administrator may require the submission of any proposed address
or proposed change in an address in any reasonable form, including without
limitation as a part of any required site plan.
   (3)   Each street number shall be consistent with the pattern and sequence
of street numbers in the immediate area, including the range of street numbers
found along the street on which the tract, lot or building fronts.
   (4)   Street numbers shall be assigned using a grid system wherein the
numerical range of street numbers on a street is based on the numerical range
of the street numbers on the closest existing streets that run parallel with
the street for which street numbers are being assigned.  The administrator
shall have the authority to establish a specific grid system based on this
principle.
   (5)   All odd-numbered street numbers shall be located on the north and west
sides of the street, all even-numbered street numbers shall be located on the
south and east sides of the street.  For streets running from a southeast to
northwest direction, the administrator may determine the assignment of even and
odd street numbers based on the street numbers on the closest existing streets
that run parallel with the street for which street numbers are being assigned. 
Street numbers on curving streets shall consistently follow the original
pattern of street numbers on that street throughout the entire length of the
street.  Within a cul-de-sac, street numbers shall be assigned as if the street
culminates in a dead-end at the mid-point of the cul-de-sac.
   (6)   100 shall be the lowest possible street number assigned on any given
street.
   (7)   Each tract of land and platted lot will be assigned a street number on
the street on which the tract of land or platted lot fronts.  If there is a
building located or proposed on a tract of land or platted lot, the street
number will be assigned on the street upon which the building fronts or will
front.
   (8)   No fractions or decimals (for example, ½ or .5) shall be used in any
address.
   (9)   No alphabetical characters (for example, A, B, C, D, etc.) shall be
used in any address.
   (10)   No hyphens (for example, 1-3, 1-A, etc.) shall be used in any

   (11)   The duplication of addresses shall not be permitted.
   (12)   No address shall be assigned to an accessory building.
   (13)   Buildings that are not attached to each other in such a way as to
permit a person to travel from one building to the other while being completely
enclosed at all times (such as buildings attached at the roofline and connected
only with a breezeway) shall be treated as separate buildings for purposes of
this article.
(d)   Denialof building permit.  A building permit shall not be issued for any
building or for construction on any tract of land or platted lot for which this
article requires an address or addresses until the required address or
addresses are assigned as required by this article.
(e)   Change of assigned address.  Once assigned, an address shall not be
changed unless the change is approved or directed in advance by the
administrator.  In addition, no street number shall be changed after any
building associated with the street number has been occupied by anyone unless
one of the following is true:
   (1)   the change is necessary to make the street number comport with the
pattern and sequence of street numbers in the immediate area; or
   (2)   this article requires the assignment of a new or additional street
number and the current pattern and sequence of street numbers in the immediate
area does not allow room for the required new or additional street number.
Sec. 91-31.  Additional requirements for standard one-family dwelling units.
A street number shall be assigned to each standard one-family dwelling unit.
Sec. 91-32.  Additional requirements for alternative one-family dwelling units.
A single street number shall be assigned to each alternative one-family
dwelling unit complex.  Each dwelling unit within an alternative one-family
dwelling unit complex shall then be assigned a sequential number that is unique
within that alternative one-family dwelling complex.  The number may be
designated as a “lot number” or by another similar term, but such terms shall
be used consistently within the same alternative one-family dwelling unit
complex.  Example: 1000 Main Street, Lot 1, Lot 2, Lot 3, etc.
Sec. 91-33.  Additional requirements for multiple-unit buildings.
(a)   Street numbers required.  A single street number shall be assigned to
each multiple-unit building that is not part of a multiple-building complex.
(b)   Unit numbers required.  Each unit in each multiple-unit building shall be
assigned a single unit number, and each unit number shall be assigned based on
the following rules:
   (1)   If there are ninety-nine (99) or fewer units on each floor of a
multiple-unit building, then each unit will be assigned a three-digit unit
number with the first digit representing the number of the floor on which the
unit is located and the number represented by the final two digits being
different from the number assigned to any other unit on the same floor.  For
example, first-floor units will be assigned a unit number between 101 and 199,
inclusive; second-floor units (if any) will be assigned a unit number between
201 and 299, inclusive; third-floor units (if any) will be assigned a unit
number between 301 and 399, inclusive; and so forth.
   (2)   If there are more than ninety-nine (99) units on any one floor of a
multiple-unit building, then each unit will be assigned a four-digit unit

to right.
   (4)   Units with interior main entrances shall have assigned the lowest unit
number to the first unit on the left as accessed from the main entrance to the
building and continue assigning unit numbers in sequential order in a clockwise
direction.  Units with interior main entrances shall be assigned even unit
numbers on one side of the corridor or hallway and odd unit numbers on the
opposite side.
   (5)   Assignment of unit numbers shall take into consideration the potential
for future additional space divisions, and numbers may be skipped in order to
provide for such potential additions, although sequential order shall be
maintained in assigning unit numbers.
   (6)   Rooms intended and used for a primary purpose other than human
occupancy, such as custodial closets, housekeeping rooms, utility closets,
etc., shall be identified with a simple description and shall not be assigned a
unit number.

(Ord. No. 3287, § 6, 1-22-04)
Sec. 91-72.   Driveway permit.
(a)   No person shall construct, reconstruct, repair or alter any driveway nor
shall any person cut, alter or repair any curb, without first obtaining a
driveway permit or temporary driveway permit (as appropriate) for said
construction, reconstruction, repair, alteration or cut from the City Engineer.
(b)   An application for a driveway permit or temporary driveway permit shall
be in a form acceptable to the City Engineer.  In addition to any information
expressly required of an applicant for such an application by this article, the
City Engineer may require an applicant to provide such other information as
shall be reasonably necessary for the administration and enforcement of this
article. 
(c)   There shall be charged a fee for a driveway permit.  There shall be
charged a fee for a temporary driveway permit.  The amounts of said fees shall
be as established by resolution of the City Council. 
(d)   A driveway permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance.
(e)   No driveway permit shall be issued for a commercial or industrial
driveway until the City Planner and the City Engineer have approved the site
plan.  Four copies of the site plan shall be submitted in accordance with
Section 7-200 of the zoning ordinance (Ordinance No. 96, as amended by
Ordinance No. 2993 and any other relevant amending ordinances).  The site plan
shall include applicable information as outlined in Section 7-200 of the zoning
ordinance (Ordinance No. 96, as amended by Ordinance No. 2993 and any other
relevant amending ordinances), and the following items deemed necessary by the
City Engineer:
   I.   dimensions and locations of driveways being requested;
   II.   storm drain inlets and facilities;
   III.   utility poles;
   IV.   signs;
   V.   service fixtures;
   VI.   type of land use activity;

requested by the City Engineer.
(f)   On property other than residential, shared driveways and internal access
connections between adjacent properties are encouraged in those instances where
the adjoining properties are compatible in terms of land use and traffic
characteristics, and where environmental or terrain constraints do not preclude
the provision of such internal site access.  The City Engineer may, at the City
Engineer’s discretion, determine cases where shared driveways are not
attainable or feasible.  The express intent of encouraging shared driveways and
common internal site access is to minimize in number and location the total
number of curb cuts along the adjacent roadway in order to provide for safe and
efficient movement of vehicles.
(g)   If the site plan is part of a building construction plan requiring a
building permit, the driveways contained on the site plan or construction plan
for public infrastructure accompanying the site plan shall contain sufficient
detail for construction.  If the site plan is not a part of a building
construction plan requiring a building permit, the driveways contained on the
site plan shall contain sufficient detail for construction. 
(h)   Parking shall comply with regulations of the zoning ordinance and all
other city regulations. If a parking area is accessed from a state highway,
compliance with the Texas Department of Transportation access management manual
is also required.  Except within the central business zoning district (as
defined in the zoning ordinance), all parking spaces, aisles and maneuvering
areas shall be contained within the property boundaries and designed to prevent
vehicles backing from residential, commercial and industrial driveways onto the
roadway.
(i)   No driveway will be permitted without sufficient available vertical and
horizontal sight distance as outlined in the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) policy (1990) on geometric design
of highways and streets, nor will any driveway be permitted to encompass or
encroach upon municipal facilities such as street light poles, traffic signal
standards, signs, catch basins, hydrants, crosswalks, bus stop areas, utility
poles, fire alarm supports, underground pipes or ducts or other necessary
street structures.  The relocation of an affected municipal facility may be
authorized by the City Engineer; however, such relocations will be made at the
expense of the person requesting the temporary driveway permit or driveway
permit.  Relocations of affected state-owned facilities on state highways must
be authorized or permitted, if applicable, by the Texas Department of
Transportation prior to issuance of a driveway permit.  No driveway opening
onto a state highway will be permitted unless the driveway complies with the
Texas Department of Transportation access management manual and regulations for
access driveways to state highways.  Driveway openings onto state highways must
address driveway geometrics, utility location or relocation considerations,
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Texas
Accessibility Standards (TAS), environmental regulations, wetland
considerations if appropriate, and all other applicable state and federal laws,
rules, and regulations to the satisfaction of the Texas Department of
Transportation.
(j)   A driveway permit is required to retain or modify any existing driveway
where vacant property is developed, new structures are constructed, either the
property or existing structures are modified in any way that requires the
submission of a site plan, or land use is changed.
(k)   Where, in the opinion of the City Engineer, a driveway is proposed that
meets all requirements of this article yet will by its location, design or
other element, be unduly hazardous, the City Engineer hereby has the authority
to deny such driveway location and design.
(l)   A temporary driveway permit may be allowed for the provision of a
temporary means of access to a site provided that, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, the temporary driveway location and design is not unduly hazardous
and the location and design of the temporary driveway is in accordance with the
requirements of the City Engineer.  A temporary driveway permit shall expire 90
days from its date of issuance. Temporary driveway permits on state highways
must meet the applicable criteria of this section.
(m)   It shall be the responsibility of the City Engineer to provide the Texas
Department of Transportation with a copy of permits issued on state highways no
later than ten days following issuance of same.

Sec. 91-73.   Deviations.
(a)   Where strict compliance with the provisions of this article may result in
hardship or adverse traffic conditions, the City Engineer may allow a deviation
from the requirements of this article to the extent deemed just and proper so
as to relieve such difficulty or hardship.  As an example, but without
limitation, commercial and industrial driveways which serve land uses such as
shopping centers, industrial plants, refueling stations or other uses which
generate high volumes of traffic may require special considerations based on
expected traffic volumes, vehicle mix, turning movements, and/or site
constraints. 
(b)   In considering requests for deviations from this article, the City
Engineer may require from the person requesting the temporary driveway permit
or driveway permit such information and justification as the City Engineer
shall, in the City Engineer’s professional judgment, deem appropriate for
making such a decision. Such information and justification could include, but
would not necessarily be limited to, professionally prepared traffic flow and
transportation planning studies.
(c)   The City Engineer shall not allow any deviation from the requirements of
this article that either results in detriment to the public good or impairs the
desirable general development and operation of the street in accordance with
sound planning principles and policies established in the comprehensive plan
update, metropolitan transportation plan, or subsequent official updates or
amendments thereto.
(d)   Anything to the contrary in this article notwithstanding, the City
Engineer shall not authorize any deviation from the Texas Department of
Transportation access management manual.
(Ord. No. 3287, § 6, 1-22-04)
Sec. 91-74.   Appeals.
(a)   Appeals to Construction Advisory and Appeals Board. This subsection
applies only to an appeal of the decision of the City Engineer that does not
involve any rule or regulation of the Texas Department of Transportation access
management manual.  Where the City Engineer has denied a request for a
temporary driveway permit, a driveway permit or a deviation from the
requirements of this article, the applicant may appeal to the Construction
Advisory and Appeals Bboard.  In hearing such an appeal, the Construction
Advisory and Appeals Board shall consider the opinion of the City Engineer and
shall not authorize any deviation that adversely affects safety.  The
procedures for appeal shall be the same as the procedures set forth for appeal
in the official building code of the city.
(b)   Appeals to Texas Department of Transportation.  This subsection applies
only to an appeal of the decision of the City Engineer that involves a rule or
regulation of the Texas Department of Transportation access management manual. 
Where the City Engineer has denied a request for a temporary driveway permit, a
driveway permit or a deviation from the requirements of this article, a final
appeal may be made to the Texas Department of Transportation area engineer
responsible for the respective state highway.  The appellant shall file with
the City Engineer such information as the City Engineer and the Texas
Department of Transportation area engineer shall require, and the City Engineer
shall forward such information to the appropriate area engineer of the Texas
Department of Transportation.  Said area engineer shall decide the appeal, and
said decision shall be final.

every change in the address, style, and membership of such firm.  The City
Engineer may require an applicant to provide such additional information as
shall be reasonably necessary for the administration and enforcement of this
article. 
(c)   There shall be charged a fee for a driveway constructor’s license.  The
amount of said fee shall be as established by resolution of the City Council.
(d)   An applicant for a driveway constructor’s license shall file in the
office of the City Engineer a bond in the sum of $5,000.00 conditioned that the
applicant will indemnify and save harmless the city from any and all damages of
every character arising from or caused directly or indirectly by any negligence
in the doing of such work, or from any imperfect or inadequate work done by the
applicant, and that applicant will maintain such work in a good and workmanlike
state of repair for and during a period of one year from and after its
completion and approval by the city.  The bond herein provided for shall be
executed by the applicant as principal and by a responsible surety company, as
surety thereon, and such bond shall be given each year that such person or firm
proposes to do such work in the city.  Upon any breach of any covenant in the
bond by the maker thereof, the city shall have the immediate right and
authority to sue upon the bond for the breach thereof, and to recover in a
court of competent jurisdiction the damages caused by such breach; and the bond
shall not become void upon first recovery but shall remain valid upon
subsequent suits until the entire principal of such bond is recovered upon.
(e)   A driveway constructor’s license shall be valid during the one-year
period of the bond.  Regardless of the date of issuance of the driveway

General Provisions
Sec. 92-1.   Purpose.
This chapter sets out the procedure and standards for submitting plats, for
subdividing property, and for laying out and developing lots, land and
subdivisions within the city’s corporate limits and within the city’s
extraterritorial jurisdiction.  This chapter is intended to promote the safe,
orderly and healthful development of the city by ensuring the proper and
appropriate construction of transportation facilities, water supply facilities,
sanitary sewers, drainage facilities, necessary utilities and other
infrastructure and services required for such development.  To these ends, land
shall not be subdivided unless all of the following are true:
(a)   it is of such character that it can be used safely for its intended
purpose, without endangering health or causing peril from fire, flood or other
menace;
(b)   either (1) such public improvements and regulated improvements as are
required are in place or (2) proper provision has been made to ensure the
construction of said public improvements and regulated improvements;
(c)   it conforms to the general plan of the city and its current and future
streets, alleys, parks, playgrounds, public utility facilities and, for land
lying within the corporate limits of the city, the city’s land use regulations;
(d)   it conforms to the general plan for the extension of the city and its
roads, streets, and public highways within the city and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction, taking into account access to and extension of sewer and water
mains and the instrumentalities of public utilities; and
(e)   it conforms to all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-2.   Approval of plat required; certification.
(a)   Plat Approval.  Before any plan, plat, amended plat or replat of a
subdivision or addition of land inside the city or within the city’s
extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be recorded with the County Clerk, it shall
first be approved by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.  No transfer of land in the nature of a subdivision as defined herein
shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter even though the instrument
or document of transfer may describe land so subdivided by metes and bounds. 
The filing of any plan, plat, amended plat or replat without complying with the
requirements of this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the provisions of
this chapter and is hereby prohibited.  The transfer of any land by the
delivery of or by the filing of any instrument in the nature of a conveyance
without having first complied with the requirements of this chapter shall be
deemed a violation of the provisions of this chapter and is hereby prohibited. 
There is, however, excepted from the provisions of this chapter any conveyance
transferring any land or interest in land to or from the State of Texas; County
of Gregg; County of Harrison; County of Upshur; City of Longview, Texas; or any
other governmental entity.
(b)   Plat Certification.
   (1)   On written request of an owner of land; a purchaser of real property
under a contract for deed, executory contract, or other executory conveyance;
an entity that provides utility service; or the City Council, the City Planner
shall make the following determinations regarding the owner’s land or the land
in which the purchaser, entity or City Council is interested that is located
within the jurisdiction of the municipality: (i) whether a plat is required
under this chapter for the land; and (ii) if a plat is required, whether it has
been prepared and whether it has been reviewed and approved by the appropriate
authority under this chapter.
   (2)   A request for a determination under subsection (b)(1) of this section
must identify the land that is the subject of the request.
   (3)   If the City Planner determines that a plat is not required, the City
Planner shall issue to the requesting party a written certification of that
determination.  If the City Planner determines that a plat is required and that
the plat has been prepared and has been reviewed and approved by the
appropriate authority under this chapter, the City Planner shall issue to the
requesting party a written certification of that determination.
   (4)   The City Planner shall make the City Planner’s determination under
this section within 20 days after the date the City Planner receives the
request under subsection (b)(1) of this section and shall issue the
certificate, if appropriate, within 10 days after the date the determination is
made.
   (5)   The person or entity requesting a decision of the City Planner under
this section may appeal the City Planner’s decision to the Commission by
submitting a written request of an appeal to the City Planner before the
posting deadline, whereupon the appeal will be scheduled for consideration at
the next available Commission meeting.  Additionally, the City Planner or the
person or entity requesting a decision of the City Planner under this section
may, for any reason, elect to present said request to the Commission directly. 
The Commission shall hear such request at the next regularly scheduled
Commission meeting; provided, however, that the request must be placed on the
Commission agenda before the posting deadline.  In either case, the Commission
shall make the determinations and issue the appropriate certification, if any,
required of the City Planner under this section.

representative may provide the required written consent in place of the owner
if the representative has, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney, express
written authority to act on behalf of the owner.  Signing of an application
required under this chapter shall be considered written consent to the pre-
submission proposal, plat, replat, or plat amendment being requested by such
application.

General Procedure
Sec. 92-16.   Pre-submission conference and proposal.
Prior to providing the pre-submission proposal required by this section the
subdivider shall confer with the City Engineer and City Planner to discuss the
proposed subdivision and its conformity to the comprehensive plan and other
related ordinances  and its relationship to surrounding property and streets. 
After said conference and before submitting the proposed plat, the subdivider
shall provide to the City Planner copies of a pre-submission proposal showing
the general features of the proposed development.  The pre-submission proposal
shall be provided to the City Planner by the pre-submission review deadline. 
The number of copies of said proposal that must be submitted shall be as
determined by the City Planner, not to exceed eight physical copies and one
electronic copy, each copy in the form required by the City Planner.  This pre-
submission proposal shall be drawn on a scale of 200 feet to the inch or larger
(100 feet to the inch preferred) and shall show the following information,
which shall be certified by a professional land surveyor:
(a)   title block, including subdivision name, block(s), lot(s), acreage, name
of city, county and state, and the location and description of the property
referenced to the original legal description.  The subdivision name shall not
duplicate any existing subdivision name.  If the property is part of an
existing subdivision, the existing subdivision name shall be used.  If no
subdivision name has been chosen, the name of the property as it is commonly or
locally known shall be indicated.
(b)   name, address and signature of the legal owner(s) of the property
included in the proposed subdivision.  If the applicant is not the legal owner,
a statement of the agent's authority and interest shall be submitted with the
application. 
   Such statement, which shall be signed by the legal owner(s), shall be made
in the following form:
   “I (we), the undersigned, being the legal owner(s) of the land shown on this
pre-submission proposal, hereby designate (print name of agent) as my (our)
agent, duly authorized to act on my (our) behalf in matters pertaining to the
platting of this property.
                     
   Owner(s)”

preparing the pre-submission proposal that he or she has, to the best of his or
her ability, designed the subdivision in accordance with the general
requirements of the city, with which he or she is completely familiar, and in
accordance with the ordinances and regulations governing the subdivision of
land, except where a variance is requested in writing and the reasons for which
are clearly stated.
   EXAMPLE OF SURVEYOR’S STATEMENT:
   “I,             , Registered Public Land Surveyor No.         , do hereby
certify that the above pre-submission proposal was prepared from an actual
survey made                       (by me) or                 (under my
direction and supervision) on the ground during              (Month & Year),
and it conforms to the current procedures and practices established by the
Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying as authorized by the Professional
Land Surveying Practices Act, (Texas Occupations Code Chapter 1071) and it’s
subsequent amendments.”

(h)   the proposed plan of the subdivision, showing streets, blocks, lots,
alleys, easements, building lines, parks, etc., with principal dimensions.  The
pre-submission proposal shall cover all of the tract intended to be developed,
at any time, even though it is intended by the subdividers or subdivider to
file plats and install improvements for parts of said tract by phases, sections
or units. If it is the intent to develop the area by phases, sections or units,
the first unit to be developed shall be definitely identified. The approval of
each phase, section or unit shown within the application shall not be construed
as an approval for the remainder of the future phases, sections or units (or
future development) depicted.  Additionally, the inclusion in the pre-
submission proposal of information about future phases, sections or units
(other than the one intended for immediate development) is intended solely for
the purpose of aiding city staff and the Commission in making rational
decisions about the phase, section or unit intended for immediate development
and about the correct, reasonable application of the city’s subdivision
regulations to said phase, section or unit.  The inclusion of such information
in any document provided to or submitted to the city does not constitute an
application for a permit or for approval of any nature with regard to such
future phases, sections or units and does not create any vested right under any
law of this state, of the United States or of the any local government,
including without limitation the city.
(i)   the location and dimensions of any existing structures, fences, paved
areas, cemeteries or burial grounds, and other existing features within the
proposed subdivision.

greater contour interval adequately describes the area to be subdivided.
(m)   the outline of the tract to be subdivided, with principle dimensions; and
the existing and proposed blocks, lots, setback lines, and easements, including
the square footage of the lots.  In lieu of providing the square footage of
each lot, a statement may be placed on the pre-submission proposal, which
certifies that all lots meet the appropriate lot size requirements.
(n)   the locations, sizes and other appropriate descriptions of the following
existing and proposed utility facilities:
   (1)   water mains, service connections and any special structures such as
wells, elevated storage tanks and pump stations;
   (2)   sanitary sewer mains, service connections and any special structures
or facilities such as lift stations, septic systems, lagoons, oxidation ponds
and package plants;
   (3)   stormwater drainage mains, channels, retention or detention ponds, and

or on immediately adjacent property.  Such facilities shall be in conformance
with the oil and gas wells ordinance, Chapter 61 of the city Code.
(q)   the names of the proposed streets shall conform to the names of the
existing streets and shall not duplicate or conflict with the designated name

for the common use of property owners in the proposed subdivision.
(t)   the names of the owners of all parcels abutting the subject property,
with deed references.  If property abutting the subject property is in a
platted subdivision, it may be referenced by the plat reference rather than
individual deed references.
(u)   the proposed land use for all lots.  The designations to be used when
indicating land use on a pre-submission proposal shall comport with the city
zoning ordinance, where said ordinance is applicable.
(v)   setback information relating to the existing and/or proposed zoning
district, as required.
(w)   the following statistical data in the title block:
   (1)   the total number of gross acres, per unit(s);
   (2)   the total number of lots; per unit or for the entire development.
   (3)   the number of dwelling units, the acreage, and the gross residential
density, by housing type;
   (4)   a statement, confirmed by engineering analysis, that the existing
utility mains serving a proposed subdivision are adequate. The need for
additional information shall be determined as follows:
         Upon receipt of a pre-submission proposal, the City Engineer shall
review the proposed development. The City Engineer shall determine whether
further, detailed study shall be required to assess the development's impact on
the existing water/wastewater systems.  If the City Engineer determines that
further study is necessary to confirm the adequacy of the existing mains to
serve the new development, the pre-submission proposal shall be marked,
identifying the point from which the subdivider's engineer shall be required to
confirm by analysis the adequacy of the existing system to serve the proposed
development.  Such analysis shall be provided to the City Engineer within 12
calendar days after the City Engineer notifies the subdivider or the
subdivider’s representative that the analysis is required.
Along with each pre-submission proposal, the subdivider shall submit a drainage
area map as required by Section 92-103 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-17.   Purpose of pre-submission proposal; proposal not a plat.
(a)   Purpose.  The purpose of the pre-submission proposal required under this
chapter is
   (1)   to provide the city with certain information needed for proper
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including information that will
not be shown on the plat; and
   (2)   to facilitate cooperation between city staff and the subdivider so
that the plat ultimately submitted to the city by the subdivider is legally
acceptable and in proper form.
(b)   Pre-submission proposal not a plat.  The pre-submission proposal required
by this chapter is not a plat.  The submission of a pre-submission proposal
does not constitute and shall not be construed as the submission of or filing
of a plat within the meaning of this chapter or within the meaning of the laws
of the state or of the United States, including without limitation Chapter 212
of the Texas Local Government Code.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-18.   Sight-distance study.
At any time during pre-submission the City Engineer may require a sight-
distance study and/or a traffic impact analysis for any portion of the tract to
be subdivided.  Based on the study or analysis, the City Engineer may impose
stricter standards on the proposed plat in accordance with Section 92-98 of
this chapter.  Failure to submit the required study or analysis shall be
grounds for disapproval of the plat.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-19.   Choice of approval procedure.
Prior to submission of a plat for consideration by the Commission, the
subdivider shall choose one of the approval procedures available under the
terms of this chapter. The approval procedures available shall be Track 1
(described in Article III of this chapter), Track 2 (described in Article IV of
this chapter), and, in the case of minor plats, Track 3 (described in Article V
of this chapter).
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-20.   Plat requirements.
Each and every plat submitted to the city shall be a plat of the subdivision or
section to be immediately developed.  The number of copies of the plat that
must be submitted shall be as determined by the City Planner, not to exceed
eight physical copies and one electronic copy, each copy in the form required
by the City Planner.  At least one copy of the plat shall be drawn to a scale
of one inch equals one hundred feet or larger with all figures and letters
legible and the whole proper for filing for record in the office of the County
Clerk.  Other copies required by the City Planner shall be drawn to the scale
required by the City Planner.  The plat shall not show construction features
such as curb lines or public utility lines or other structures not involved in
the title covenant unless required as part of a planned development or
specifically authorized by the City Planner.  The plat shall contain the
following information:
(a)   the title or name by which the subdivision is to be identified, north
point, the scale of the map and the name of the professional land surveyor
responsible.
(b)   a definite legal description and identification of the tract being
subdivided.  This description shall be sufficient for the requirements of title
examination. The plat shall be a descriptive diagram shown to scale.
(c)   the boundaries of the subdivided property, the location or designation of
all streets, alleys, parks, easements and other areas intended to be dedicated
or deeded to the public use, with proper dimensions.  The boundaries of the
subdivision shall be indicated by a heavy line and shall be tied by dimension
to the established centerline of any existing boundary streets.
(d)   the location of all adjacent streets and alleys, with their names, and
the names of adjoining subdivisions with exact location and designated by
number of lots and blocks.  If adjoining property is undeveloped, the name of
the owner of record shall be designated.

boundary lines,  school district boundary lines, and boundary lines of other
developed subdivisions, including but not limited to water districts and any
other public entities, adjacent to or within the subdivision.
(f)   all lot, block and street boundary lines, with block numbers as
designated by the City Planner and lots numbered consecutively.  Building lines
and easements shall be shown and shall be defined by dimension.  The actual
width  of the right-of-way of proposed streets shall be shown, measured at
right angles or radially, where curved.  All principal lines shall have the
bearing given and any deviations from the norm shall be indicated. There shall
be sufficient annotation shown on the plat that every street, lot, easement,
boundary line or any other matter of a surveying nature shown thereon is
capable of being laid out on the ground, based solely upon the data shown on
the plat.
(g)   accurate dimensions, both linear and angular, of all items on the plat;
the boundary survey of the site must conform to the current procedures and
practices established by the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying, as
authorized by the Professional Land Surveying Practices Act, as amended. Linear
dimensions may be expressed in feet and decimals of a foot; angular dimensions
may be shown by bearings.  Curved boundaries shall be fully described and all
essential information given; circular curves shall be defined by actual length
of radius and not by degree of curvature. Complete reference monuments with a
descriptive legend are required.
(h)   the location of all lot and block corners and permanent survey reference
monuments with a descriptive legend.
(i)   a certificate that the plat is true and correct and in accordance with
the determination of surveys actually made on the ground, placed on the face of
the plat.  The certificate shall also state that the plat was made in
accordance with the current procedures and practices established by the Texas
Board of Professional Land Surveying, as authorized by the Professional Land
Surveying Practices Act. The certificate shall be sworn before a notary public
by the professional land surveyor who surveyed, mapped, and monumented the land
to be subdivided.  The certificate shall show whether or not the tract is
within 3½ miles of the city, measured in a straight line from the nearest
points of the city limits, unless the information is shown in a suitable manner
elsewhere on the face of the plat.  The following sample certificate is
included herein to illustrate the minimum information required in said
certificate.  Any additional information or changes in form may be made,
provided that the minimum information is contained therein.
   “I             (Name of Professional Land Surveyor) of the State of Texas,
do hereby certify that this plat is true and correct and represents the results
of a survey made on the ground of a subdivision of a ____-acre tract.  This

Sec. 92-21.   Amending plats.
(a)   Prerequisites for amending plat.  The subdivider requesting an amending
plat shall prepare a plat, per Section 92-20 of this chapter, and submit said
plat to the City Planner for approval.  The amending plat and any variance
request shall be submitted during the submission period.  The Commission may
approve and issue an amending plat, which may be recorded and then is
controlling over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat, only if the
amending plat is signed by the applicants only and the only purpose(s) of the
amending plat is/are one or more of the following:
   (1)   to correct an error in a course or distance shown on the preceding
plat;
   (2)   to add a course or distance that was omitted on the preceding plat;
   (3)   to correct an error in a real property description shown on the
preceding plat;
   (4)   to indicate monuments set after the death, disability, or retirement
from practice of the engineer or surveyor responsible for setting monuments;
   (5)   to show the location or character of a monument that has been changed
in location or character or that is shown incorrectly as to location or
character on the preceding plat;
   (6)   to correct any other type of scrivener or clerical error or omission
previously approved, including lot numbers, acreage, street names, and
identification of adjacent recorded plats;
   (7)   to correct an error in courses and distances of lot lines between two
adjacent lots if:
      a.   both lot owners join in the application for amending the plat;
      b.   neither lot is abolished;
      c.   the amendment does not attempt to remove recorded covenants or
restrictions; and
      d.   the amendment does not have a material adverse effect on the
property rights of the other owners in the plat;
   (8)   to relocate a lot line to eliminate an inadvertent encroachment of a
building or other improvement on a lot line or easement;
   (9)   to relocate one or more lot lines between one or more adjacent lots
if:
      a.   the owners of all those lots join in the application for amending
the plat;
      b.   the amendment does not attempt to remove recorded covenants or
restrictions; and
      c.   the amendment does not increase the number of lots;
   (10)   to make necessary changes to the preceding plat to create six or
fewer lots in the subdivision or a part of the subdivision covered by the
preceding plat if:
      a.   the changes do not affect applicable zoning and other regulations of
the city;
      b.   the changes do not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or
restrictions; and
      c.   the area covered by the changes is located in an area that the
Commission has approved, after a public hearing, as a residential improvement
area; or
   (11)   to replat one or more lots fronting on an existing street if:
      a.   the owners of all those lots join in the application for amending
the plat;
      b.   the amendment does not attempt to remove recorded covenants or
restrictions;
      c.   the amendment does not increase the number of lots; and
      d.   the amendment does not create or require the creation of a new
street or make necessary the extension of municipal facilities.
(b)   Approval authority for amending plat.  The City Planner may approve an
amending plat that complies with this section and that does not require a
variance, but may not disapprove an amending plat.  If an amending plat is not
approved by the City Planner before the posting deadline or if the amending
plat requires a variance, the amending plat (and variance request, if any)
shall be scheduled for consideration at the next available Commission meeting. 
Additionally, the City Planner or the subdivider may, for any reason, elect to
present the amending plat to the Commission for approval/disapproval/
conditional approval; provided, however, that the amending plat must be placed
on the Commission agenda before the posting deadline.  If the subdivider does
not agree to conditions of approval imposed by the City Planner, the subdivider
shall submit written notice of such to the City Planner before the posting
deadline, whereupon the amending plat will be scheduled for consideration at
the next available Commission meeting.  Action will be taken on the amending
plat in the same manner as for a plat, as set forth in Section 92-69 of this
chapter.
(c)   Notice, public hearing and approval of other lot owners not required. 
Notice, a public hearing, and the approval of other lot owners (other than any
lot owners that are required to join in the application under this section) are
not required for the approval and issuance of an amending plat in accordance
with this section.
(d)   Filing. Upon the approval of an amending plat in accordance with this
section by the Commission or by the City Planner, the amended plat may be filed
with the County Clerk.

requirements therefor. 
(b)   Vacation of preceding plat required.  Except to the extent provided
otherwise by this section, a replat may only be approved after the preceding
plat has been vacated. 
(c)   Replat without vacation of preceding plat.  A replat of a subdivision or
part of a subdivision may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding
plat (without vacation of the preceding plat) as provided in this section:

approved county tax roll of the property upon which the replat is being
requested. A copy of subsection (c)(7) of this section must be attached to the
written notice.
   (7)   if the proposed replat is subject to subsection (c)(6) of this section
and requires a variance and is protested in accordance with this section, the
proposed replat must receive, in order to be approved, the affirmative vote of
at least three-fourths of the members present of the Commission.  For a legal
protest, written instruments signed  by the owners of at least 20% of the area
of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed
replat and  extending 200 feet from that area, but within the original
subdivision, must be filed with the City Planner prior to the public hearing.
In computing the percentage of total land area, the area of streets and alleys
shall be included.  Regardless of whether or not a legal protest is submitted,
the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the members present of the
Commission is not required for approval of a replat of part of a preceding plat
if the area to be replatted was designated or reserved for other than single or
duplex family residential use by notation on the last legally recorded plat or
in the legally recorded restrictions applicable to the plat.
   (8)   except to the extent provided otherwise by this section, a replat that
does meet the requirements of this section shall be subject to all the same
requirements and provisions as a plat.  For example, the procedure for
consideration of such a replat (including without limitation the requirement to
provide a pre-submission proposal and the choice of procedures under Sections
92-16 and 92-19 of this chapter), the types of action that may be taken on
replats, the types of information that must be included on replats, the
improvements that must be provided and any applicable deadlines (including
without limitation the submission period) and expiration periods shall be the
same as for plats.
(d)   any replat subject to subsection (c)(6) of this section (along with such
related materials as the City Planner shall require) shall be provided to the
City Planner by 9:00 a.m. on the last Tuesday of the month that is two months
before the Commission meeting at which the replat will be considered.  The
provision of a replat in accordance with this subsection shall not be construed
as a submission of the replat for approval and shall not be construed as the
start the 30-day time limit for Commission approval.  Instead, the provision of
a replat under this subsection is intended to allow city staff and the
subdivider to work together so that a final, clean, compliant version of the
replat may be submitted by the pre-submission review deadline.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-23.   Vacating plat.
The owners of a tract covered by a plat may vacate the plat at any time before
any lot in the plat is sold.  The plat is vacated when a signed, acknowledged
instrument declaring the plat vacated is approved and recorded in the manner
prescribed for the original plat.  If lots in the plat have been sold, the
plat, or any part of the plat, may be vacated on the application of all the
owners of lots in the plat with approval obtained in the manner prescribed for
the original plat.  On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument,
the vacated plat has no effect.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-24.   Review of plans and specifications by City Engineer.
(a)   Plans and specifications required; requirements. Before beginning any
construction of the regulated improvements, the subdivider shall submit to the
City Engineer the number of complete sets of plans and specifications of such
construction as the City Engineer shall require, not to exceed six sets.  These
shall show such features as streets, cross-sections and longitudinal slope for
drainage, full description of proposed pavement or street improvement, its
grade and slopes, dimensions and specifications concerning public utilities to
be installed showing proposed position on the ground, specifications of
materials and construction, and plan-profile maps of all water lines, sanitary
sewers and storm sewers showing both ground surface and flow line, and any
other pertinent information required by the City Engineer.  These plans and
specifications must be prepared by a professional engineer and shall be based
on the City of Longview, Texas2002 Mapping and Monumentation Project Horizontal
and Vertical Control Network.
(b)   Consideration of plans and specifications by City Engineer.  The City
Engineer shall accept the plans and specifications submitted by the subdivider
under this section if they conform to the requirements of this chapter and have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices. If
the plans and specifications do not conform to the requirements of this
chapter, the City Engineer shall reject same, giving the reasons for rejection
in writing to the subdivider.  When the subdivider has met the objections of
the City Engineer, if any, the City Engineer shall accept the plans and
specifications as meeting minimum standards and forthwith deliver same to the
subdivider, the subdivider's agent or the subdivider's engineer.
(c)   Construction to be in accordance with accepted plans and specifications.
Construction of any of the regulated improvements shall be prohibited unless
the plans and specifications for said construction have been accepted in
accordance with the requirements of this section.  Construction of any of the
regulated improvements shall be prohibited unless said construction complies
with the plans and specifications accepted by the City Engineer.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 9, 9-12-02; Ord. No. 3241, § 4,
8-28-03)
Sec. 92-25.   Inspection of improvements; conditions for acceptance.
(a)   Inspections; letters.  The City Planner or City Engineer may inspect any
of the regulated improvements at any time during the construction or after the
completion of the regulated improvement in order to determine whether or not
the regulated improvement is constructed in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter.  After the completion of all regulated improvements within a
subdivision, if said regulated improvements are constructed in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter and with the plans and specifications
previously accepted by the City Engineer:
   (1)   the City Engineer shall issue a letter to the subdivider or to the
subdivider's representative stating that said regulated improvements are in
compliance with the accepted plans and specifications; and
   (2)   the City Engineer may require a signed compliance letter from the
subdivider's contractor, engineer, or both.
(b)   Warranty; acceptance.  The subdivider and subdivider's contractor shall
be responsible for and warranty all regulated improvements until the expiration
of one year from the date of the letter issued by the City Engineer under this
section.  For subdivisions within the corporate limits of the city, regulated
improvements shall be considered accepted by the city upon the expiration of
one year from the date of the letter issued by the City Engineer under this
section.
(c)   Maintenance bonds.  All contracts for the construction of regulated
improvements shall include a requirement for a maintenance bond equal to 20% of
the contract price guaranteeing the contractor's materials and workmanship to
the city and the subdivider for a period of one year from the date of the
letter issued by the City Engineer under this section; provided, however, that
the City Engineer may waive this requirement for that portion of a subdivision
lying outside the corporate limits of the city.  Additionally, within that
portion of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Longview lying
within Gregg County, all construction contracts between the subdivider and
contractor(s) shall include a requirement for a maintenance bond in an amount
acceptable to Gregg County guaranteeing the contractor's materials and
workmanship to Gregg County and the subdivider and guaranteeing that the
streets, drainage and related appurtenances are constructed in full compliance
with the subdivision regulations of the city and shall be maintained in a
manner satisfactory to Gregg County for a period of one year from the date of
the letter issued by the City Engineer under this section.  Within that portion
of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Longview lying within
Harrison County, all construction contracts between the subdivider and
contractor(s) shall include a requirement for a maintenance bond in an amount
acceptable to Harrison County guaranteeing the contractor's materials and
workmanship to Harrison County and the subdivider and guaranteeing that the
streets, drainage and related appurtenances are constructed in full compliance
with the subdivision regulations of the city and shall be maintained in a
manner satisfactory to Harrison County for two years from the date of the
letter issued by the City Engineer under this section.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3241, § 5, 8-28-03)
Sec. 92-26.   Variances.
(a)   Variance request procedure.  If a pre-submission proposal or plat does
not comply with the requirements of this chapter, the subdivider shall submit a
letter requesting a variance.  A variance request letter relating to a pre-
submission proposal shall be submitted during the submission period.  A
variance request letter relating to a plat shall be submitted during the
submission period.  A letter requesting a variance must detail each specific
requirement with which the pre-submission proposal or plat does not comply and
detail the rationale for a variance from the requirement.  A variance shall not
be granted from any requirement for which a variance request letter has not
been submitted or for which a variance request letter has not been submitted in
accordance with the applicable deadline or submission period.  Along with a
non-compliant plat or pre-submission proposal, the applicant may also submit a
plat or pre-submission proposal that complies with the requirements of this
chapter in the event that the variance request is disapproved.
(b)   Commission authority regarding variances.  Where the Commission finds
that extraordinary hardships may result from requiring strict compliance with
this chapter, the Commission may vary the requirements of this chapter so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that
such variation shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of these regulations.  Such variances as may be granted shall require approval
by simple majority of the Commission present, and the Commission may place such
conditions on such variances as the Commission shall deem appropriate.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 10, 9-12-02; Ord. No. 3441, § 3,
4-13-06)
Sec. 92-27.   Submission dates; effect of pre-submission review; pre-submission
proposal not plat, replat or amended plat.
(a)   Submission dates; effect of pre-submission review.  For the purposes of
this chapter and other law, including without limitation Chapter 212 of the
Texas Local Government Code, a plat, replat, amended plat, pre-submission
proposal, infrastructure permit application or other document required under
this chapter is not considered to be submitted to or filed with the city until
it is received by the City Planner in the form required by this chapter, with
the number of copies required by this chapter and in accordance with the
procedures for submission set forth in this chapter, along with written notice
that the document is in the final form intended by the subdivider to be
officially filed with or submitted to the city.  Further, the providing of a
copy of a plat, replat, amended plat, pre-submission proposal, infrastructure
permit application or other document required by this chapter to the City
Planner by the pre-submission review deadline (or by another deadline preceding
the pre-submission deadline) for purposes of pre-submission review by city
staff shall not be construed as submission of said document to the city or
filing of said document with the city; provided, however, that for purposes of
any other relevant deadlines, any document so provided shall be considered to
be submitted to and/or filed with the city on the latter of (1) the first day
of the submission period if the document otherwise meets the requirements of
this section or (2) the day on which the subdivider submits said document in
the final form intended by the subdivider to be officially filed with or
submitted to the city and in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(b)    Pre-submission proposal not plat, replat or amended plat.  For purposes
of this chapter and of any other law, the term “plat” does not include the pre-
submission proposal required by this chapter; the term “replat” does not
include the pre-submission proposal required by this chapter; and the term
“plat amendment” or “amended plat” does not include the pre-submission proposal
required by this chapter. The submission or provision of a pre-submission
proposal does not constitute the submission of or filing of a plat, replat, or
amended plat.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-28.   Withdrawal of plat.
(a)    Procedure for withdrawal.  At any time before the approval of a plat by
the Commission, the person or persons applying for approval of the plat may
withdraw the plat and/or any associated permits and applications by filing with
the City Planner a written statement requesting to withdraw the plat.  The
statement shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and shall be
signed by the same persons who signed the application for the plat (or for any
associated permits, such as the infrastructure permit) or by those persons’
duly authorized representatives.  The City Attorney may require proof that a
person signing on another’s behalf is duly authorized to do so.  A withdrawal
shall be effective on the effective date specified in the withdrawal.  If an
effective date is not expressly stated in a withdrawal, the withdrawal shall be
effective immediately upon its receipt by the City Planner in a form that meets
the requirements of this section.
(b)    Effect of withdrawal. If a plat or the permits and applications
associated with a plat are withdrawn in accordance with this section, the plat
and all associated permits and applications shall be considered null and void
immediately upon the effective date of withdrawal.  Such a plat shall no longer
be considered to be filed and shall not be considered approved by virtue of the
fact that it is not disapproved within 30 days after it was originally filed. 
Any succeeding plat request and any related applications and permits shall be
considered a new plat request and shall be subject to all the requirements of
law in effect at the time of the succeeding plat request, application, or
permit.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-29.   Signing of approved plats, amended plats and replats.
Upon the approval of a plat, amended plat or replat in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter by the City Planner and only after the posting of
any associated security required by this chapter, the plat shall be signed by
the City Planner. Upon the approval of a plat, amended plat or replat in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter by the Commission and only after
the posting of any associated security required by this chapter, the plat shall
be signed by either (1) the Chair of the Commission with the secretary of the
Commission attesting to the Chair's signature or (2) a majority of the members
of the Commission.

a subdivision unless all of the following are true:
   (1)   any plat required by law for the subdivision has been approved; and
   (2)   all regulated improvements within the subdivision have been completed

section notwithstanding, after acceptance by the City Engineer of the plans and
specifications required by Section 92-24 of this chapter, the city may issue
any permit, certificate or license necessary for the construction of (but not
authorizing the occupancy of) the foundation of a building or structure;
provided, however, that such permit, certificate or license may authorize the
construction of only the foundation of the building and that such permit,
certificate or license must be issued in accordance with the requirements of
any applicable city codes and ordinances.
(d)   Construction permits where fire protection available.  Any other

Secs. 92-31 - 92-45.  Reserved.
Article III.
Track 1:  Post-Construction Plat Submission
Sec. 92-46.   Application of this article.
Except to the extent expressly provided otherwise by this chapter, this article
applies only to a subdivision for which the subdivider has elected the Track 1
approval procedure under Section 92-19 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-47.   Infrastructure permit.
(a)   Pre-submission proposal required; variance request.  If a subdivider
chooses the Track 1 approval procedure, the subdivider shall work with the City
Planner and the City Engineer to prepare a version of the pre-submission
proposal that complies with the requirements of this chapter, including without
limitation the requirements of Section 92-16.  Alternatively, the subdivider
may prepare a version of the pre-submission proposal that does not fully comply
with the provisions of this chapter and concurrently submit a request for a
variance for those aspects of the proposed subdivision that do not comply with
the provisions of this chapter.  Such a variance request must conform to the
requirements of Section 92-26 of this chapter.
(b)   Application for infrastructure permit.  Once the subdivider has the pre-
submission proposal in final form, the subdivider shall complete an application
for an infrastructure permit.  The application shall be in a form approved by
the City Planner and shall include copies of the pre-submission proposal.  The
number of copies of said proposal that must be provided shall be as determined
by the City Planner, not to exceed eight physical copies and one electronic
copy, each copy in the form required by the City Planner.  The application and
accompanying copies of the pre-submission proposal must be received by the City
Planner by or before the pre-submission review deadline.  If the infrastructure
permit application or any of the required materials are not received by or
before the pre-submission review deadline, the permit application may be
disapproved by the Commission.
(c)   Approval authority for infrastructure permit.  The City Planner and City
Engineer jointly may approve an infrastructure permit application and issue an
infrastructure permit if the pre-submission application does not require a
variance, but may not disapprove an infrastructure permit application.  If an
infrastructure permit application requires a variance, then the permit
application (and variance, if one is requested) shall be scheduled for
consideration at the next available Commission meeting.  Additionally, the City
Planner, the City Engineer or the subdivider may, for any reason, elect to
present an infrastructure permit application to the Commission for approval/
disapproval/conditional approval; provided, however, that the infrastructure
permit application must be placed on the Commission agenda before the posting
deadline.  If the subdivider does not agree to conditions of approval imposed
by the City Planner or the City Engineer, the subdivider shall submit written
notice of such to the City Planner before the posting deadline, whereupon the
infrastructure permit application will be scheduled for consideration at the
next available Commission meeting.  Action will be taken on the infrastructure
permit application as set forth in Section 92-48 of this chapter.
(d)   Sight-distance study/traffic impact analysis.  If the City Engineer
requires a sight-distance study and/or traffic impact analysis under the
authority of Section 92-18 of this chapter and the pre-submission proposal is
scheduled to be presented to the Commission, then the requested study and/or
analysis must be submitted to the City Engineer at least five calendar days
prior to the date on which the Commission is scheduled to review the pre-
submission proposal.  If such a study and/or analysis is required and the pre-
submission proposal is not scheduled to be presented to the Commission, then
the City Engineer shall review the study and/or analysis and specify any
stricter standards required by the City Engineer (under the authority of
Section 92-98 of this chapter) within five calendar days after the City
Engineer receives the requested study and/or analysis.  If the City Engineer
has requested such a study and/or analysis, no infrastructure permit shall be
issued until said study and/or analysis has been submitted to the City Engineer
in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, §§ 12, 13, 9-12-02)
Sec. 92-48.   Commission consideration of infrastructure permit.
On receipt of the infrastructure permit application and other information
required by this chapter, the Commission shall take one of the following
actions within 30 days from the date on which the application was officially
submitted to the city in accordance with Section 92-27 of this chapter:
(a)   approval of the requested infrastructure permit;
(b)   disapproval of the requested infrastructure permit; or
(c)   conditional approval of the requested infrastructure permit.
   Conditional approval of an infrastructure permit shall be disapproval of the
infrastructure permit until compliance with the prescribed conditions, but
shall be deemed to be approval of such infrastructure permit upon compliance
with such conditions.  All objections made to the infrastructure permit, and
any conditions imposed on the infrastructure permit, shall be furnished by the
City Planner to the subdivider in writing.  If an infrastructure permit is
neither disapproved nor conditionally approved by the Commission within 30 days
from the date on which the application was officially submitted to the city in
accordance with Section 92-27 of this chapter, it shall be deemed to have been
issued.  Denial of an infrastructure permit by the Commission shall be final
and may not be appealed to the City Council.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 14, 9-12-02)
Sec. 92-49.   Plans and specifications required.
After the approval of an infrastructure permit and before beginning the
construction of any of the regulated improvements, the subdivider shall submit
to the City Engineer plans and specifications, as per Section 92-24 of this
chapter, for the section or sections of the tract intended for immediate
development.  The Commission shall disapprove any plat for which the subdivider
has not submitted plans and specifications to the City Engineer as required by
Section 92-24 of this chapter.  The Commission shall disapprove any plat for
which the plans and specifications have not been accepted by the City Engineer
in accordance with Section 92-24; provided, however, that the Commission may
grant a variance upon proper application by the subdivider in accordance with
Section 92-26.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 15, 9-12-02)
Sec. 92-50.   Amendment of infrastructure permit.
(a)    Application for infrastructure permit amendment. After the issuance of
an infrastructure permit, the subdivider may request an amendment to said
permit.  The amendment request shall be in a form approved by the City Planner
and shall include such information as reasonably required by the City Planner
and City Engineer.  The number of copies of said amendment request that must be
provided shall be as determined by the City Planner, not to exceed eight
physical copies and one electronic copy, each copy in the form required by the
City Planner.  The amendment request and any accompanying materials required by
the City Planner or City Engineer must be received by the City Planner by or
before the pre-submission review deadline.  If the amendment request or any of
the required materials are not received by or before the pre-submission review
deadline, the permit application may be disapproved by the Commission.
(b)   Approval authority for infrastructure permit amendment.  The City Planner
and City Engineer jointly may, in their discretion, approve an amendment
request so long as such amendment does not require a variance, but may not
disapprove an amendment request.  If an amendment requires a variance, then the
amendment (and variance, if one is requested) shall be scheduled for
consideration at the next available Commission meeting.  Additionally, the City
Planner, the City Engineer or the subdivider may, for any reason, elect to
present an amendment request to the Commission for approval/disapproval/
conditional approval; provided, however, that the amendment request must be
placed on the Commission agenda before the posting deadline.  If the subdivider
does not agree to conditions of approval imposed by the City Planner or City
Engineer, the subdivider shall submit written notice of such to the City
Planner before the posting deadline, whereupon the amendment request will be
scheduled for consideration at the next available Commission meeting.  Action
will be taken on the amendment request in the same manner as for an
infrastructure permit application, as set forth in Section 92-48 of this
chapter.  However, neither the application for nor the approval of any
amendment to an infrastructure permit shall extend or otherwise alter any of
the deadlines set forth in this chapter, including without limitation the
submission period, the pre-submission review deadline and any other deadlines
for complying with any other requirements of this chapter. 
(c)   Withdrawal of application for infrastructure permit amendment.  At any
time before the approval of an amendment request, the person or persons
requesting the amendment may withdraw the amendment request by filing with the
City Planner a written statement requesting to withdraw the amendment request. 
The statement shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney.  A withdrawal
shall be effective on the effective date specified in the withdrawal.  If an
effective date is not expressly stated in a withdrawal, the withdrawal shall be
effective immediately upon its receipt by the City Planner in a form that meets
the requirements of this section.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 16, 9-12-02)
Sec. 92-51.   Expiration of infrastructure permit; extension.
If the requirements for approval of the permit have not been met and no plat
has been submitted at the end of one year from the date that the infrastructure
permit was issued, the infrastructure permit shall become null and void.  The
subdivider may apply to the City Planner in writing for a one-time, 12-month
administrative extension prior to the expiration of one year from the date that
the infrastructure permit was issued, citing reasonable cause for an extension
and demonstrating that the subdivider is actively pursuing the development of
construction plans or a plat.  For example, the City Planner may grant such an
extension if a corresponding plat is active, if the subdivision is under
construction or if construction plans are in the possession of the city and
under review by city staff at the time of the request for an extension.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 17, 9-12-02)
Sec. 92-52.   Plat submission.
After completion of all regulated improvements within the subdivision in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, a subdivider shall prepare and
submit to the Commission a plat that complies with the requirements of Section
92-20 and the other applicable provisions of this chapter.  If the subdivider
has elected to develop the subdivision shown on the pre-submission proposal in
phases or sections, the plat shall include only those sections or phases of the
subdivision which meet the following requirements: (1) the plans and
specifications for said sections or phases have been accepted by the City
Engineer, and (2) the subdivider has completed all regulated improvements
included in said plans and specifications in accordance with said plans and
specifications and with the provisions of this chapter.
The subdivider shall submit to the Commission the plat and an accompanying
application in a form approved by the City Planner. The number of copies of the
plat that must be submitted shall be as determined by the City Planner, not to
exceed eight physical copies and one electronic copy, each copy in the form
required by the City Planner.  The application and accompanying copies of the
plat must be submitted to the City Planner during the submission period.  If
the application, plat or any of the required materials are not submitted during
the submission period, the plat may be disapproved by the Commission.  No lots
within a subdivision may be sold until a plat is approved by the Commission.

Sec. 92-53.   Commission consideration of plat.
The Commission shall take one of the following actions within 30 days from the
date on which the plat was officially submitted to the city in accordance with
Section 92-27 of this chapter:
(a)   approval of the plat;
(b)   disapproval of the plat; or
(c)   conditional approval of the plat.
   Conditional approval of a plat shall be disapproval of the plat until
compliance with the prescribed conditions, but shall be deemed to be approval
of such plat upon compliance with such conditions.  All objections made to the
plat, and any conditions imposed on the plat, shall be furnished by the City
Planner to the subdivider in writing. If a plat is neither disapproved nor
conditionally approved by the Commission within 30 days from the date on which
the plat application was officially submitted to the city in accordance with
Section 92-27 of this chapter, it shall be deemed to have been approved by the
Commission.  Disapproval of a plat by the Commission shall be final and may not
be appealed to the City Council.
   The Commission shall disapprove the plat if the subdivider has failed to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter and no variance is granted
for the noncompliance.  For purposes of this section, the phrase “failed to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter” includes any one or more
of the following: (1) the failure to provide a pre-submission proposal that
complies with the applicable requirements of this chapter, (2) the failure to

Article IV.
Track 2: Pre-Construction Plat Submission
Sec. 92-66.   Application of this article.
Except to the extent expressly provided otherwise by this chapter, this article
applies only to a subdivision for which the subdivider has elected the Track 2
approval procedure under Section 92-19 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-67.   Pre-submission proposal required.
(a)   Pre-submission proposal required; variance request.  If a subdivider
chooses the Track 2 approval procedure, the subdivider shall work with the City
Planner and the City Engineer to prepare a version of the pre-submission
proposal that complies with the requirements of this chapter, including without
limitation the requirements of Section 92-16.  Alternatively, the subdivider
may prepare a version of the pre-submission proposal that does not fully comply
with the provisions of this chapter and concurrently submit a request for a
variance for those aspects of the proposed subdivision that do not comply with
the provisions of this chapter.  Such a variance request must conform to the
requirements of Section 92-26 of this chapter. The number of copies of the pre-
submission proposal that must be provided shall be as determined by the City
Planner, not to exceed eight physical copies and one electronic copy, each copy
in the form required by the City Planner.  The pre-submission proposal shall be
provided to the City Planner by the pre-submission review deadline.
(b)   Sight-distance study/traffic impact analysis.  If the City Engineer
requires a sight-distance study and/or traffic impact analysis under the
authority of Section 92-18 of this chapter, then the requested study and/or
analysis must be submitted to the City Engineer at least 5 calendar days prior
to the date on which the Commission is scheduled to review the plat.  If the
City Engineer has requested such a study and/or analysis, no plat shall be
issued until said study and/or analysis has been submitted to the City Engineer
in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

Sec. 92-68.   Plat submission.
Once the subdivider has the pre-submission proposal in final form, the
subdivider shall prepare and submit to the Commission a plat that complies with
the requirements of Section 92-20 and any other applicable provisions in this
chapter.  If the subdivider intends to develop the subdivision shown on the
pre-submission proposal in phases or sections, the plat shall include only
those sections or phases of the subdivision that the subdivider intends for
immediate development.
The subdivider shall submit to the Commission the plat and any supporting
documentation required by the City Planner (such as the associated application
and any variance requested) in a from approved by the City Planner.  The number
of copies of the plat that must be submitted shall be as determined by the City
Planner, not to exceed eight physical copies and one electronic copy, each copy
in the form required by the City Planner.  The application and accompanying
copies of the plat must be submitted to the City Planner during the submission
period.  If the application, plat or any of the required materials are not
submitted during the submission period, the plat may be disapproved by the
Commission.  No lots within a subdivision may be sold until a plat is approved
by the Commission.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 21, 9-12-02)
Sec. 92-69.   Commission consideration of plat.
The Commission shall take one of the following actions within 30 days from the
date on which the plat was officially submitted to the city in accordance with
Section 92-27 of this chapter:
(a)   approval of the plat;
(b)   disapproval of the plat; or
(c)   conditional approval of the plat.
   Conditional approval of a plat shall be disapproval of the plat until
compliance with the prescribed conditions, but shall be deemed to be approval
of such plat upon compliance with such conditions.  All objections made to the
plat, and any conditions imposed on the plat, shall be furnished by the City
Planner to the subdivider in writing.  If a plat is neither disapproved nor
conditionally approved by the Commission within 30 days from the date on which
the plat application was officially submitted to the city in accordance with
Section 92-27 of this chapter, it shall be deemed to have been approved by the
Commission.  Disapproval of a plat by the Commission shall be final and may not
be appealed to the City Council.
   The Commission shall disapprove the plat if the subdivider has failed to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter and no variance is granted
for the noncompliance.  For purposes of this section, the phrase “failed to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter” includes any one or more
of the following: (1) the failure to provide a pre-submission proposal that
complies with the applicable requirements of this chapter, (2) the failure to
comply with any of the applicable deadlines (including without limitation the
submission period and the pre-submission review deadline) imposed by this
chapter or imposed in accordance with the provisions hereof, (3) the failure to
provide a plat that complies with the applicable requirements of this chapter
and (4) any failure to comply with any other applicable requirement or
provision of this chapter. After approval of the plat by the Commission and the
posting of any and all security required by Section 92-72 or by any other
provision of this chapter, the plat may be filed with the County Clerk.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 22, 9-12-02)
Sec. 92-70.   Plans and specifications required.
After the approval of a plat by the Commission and before beginning the
construction of any of the regulated improvements, the subdivider shall submit
to the City Engineer plans and specifications, as per Section 92-24 of this
chapter, for the section or sections of the tract intended for immediate
development. 
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-71.   Completion of improvements required; expiration of plat;
extension.
No later than one year following the date on which a plat is approved by the
Commission the subdivider shall complete the regulated improvements in
accordance with the plans and specifications accepted by the City Engineer
under Section 92-24 of this chapter.  If the regulated improvements have not
been completed one year from the date that the plat was approved, the city may
take any of the actions described in Section 92-73 and/or in Article VIII of
this chapter.  The subdivider may apply to the City Planner in writing for a
one-time, 12-month administrative extension prior to the expiration of one year
from the date that the plat was approved, citing reasonable cause for an
extension and demonstrating that the subdivider is actively pursuing the
development of construction plans or is constructing the regulated
improvements.  For example, the City Planner may grant such an extension if the
subdivision is under construction or if construction plans are in the
possession of the city and under review by city staff at the time of the
request for an extension.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-72.   Security for improvements.
(a)   Types of security required.  Before filing a plat or selling any lots in
a plat, the subdivider shall provide sufficient security to cover the
completion of the regulated improvements in accordance with the standards set
forth in this chapter.  The security shall be in the form of a cash escrow,
letter of credit or other security acceptable to the City Attorney.  Security
shall be in an amount equal to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the
regulated improvements.  The issuer of any letter of credit or other security
shall be subject to approval of the City Attorney and all letters of credit and
other security shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney.
(b)   Requirements for letter of credit.  If the subdivider elects to post a
letter of credit as security for the completion of the regulated improvements,
the letter of credit shall:
   (1)   be irrevocable;
   (2)   be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and
warranty periods but in no event less than two years; and
   (3)   require only that the city present the issuer with a sight draft and a
certificate signed by an authorized representative of the city certifying to
the city's right to draw funds under the letter of credit.
(c)   Reduction/release of security.  As portions of the regulated improvements
are completed in accordance with the plans and specifications accepted by the
City Engineer and in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, the
subdivider may make application to the City Engineer to reduce the amount of
the original letter of credit.  If the City Engineer is satisfied that such
portion of the regulated improvements has been completed in accordance with
city standards, the City Engineer may (but is not required to) cause the amount
of the letter of credit to be reduced by such amount deemed appropriate, so
that the remaining amount of the letter of credit adequately insures the
completion of the remaining regulated improvements.
   Upon the issuance by the City Engineer of the letter required by Section 92-
25 of this chapter and the receipt by the City Engineer of any signed
compliance letter required under said section, the city shall authorize a
reduction in the security to twenty (20) percent of the original amount of the
security if the subdivider is not in violation of this chapter.  The remaining
security, if any, shall serve as  security for the maintenance of the regulated
improvements and the warrant that the regulated improvements are free from
defect for one year thereafter.  If the subdivider’s contractors or others
provide the required security for maintenance and warranty, the city shall 
release the entire amount of the subdivider security.
(d)   Temporary improvements.  The subdivider shall build and pay for all costs
of temporary improvements required by the City Engineer and shall maintain
those temporary improvements for the period specified by the Commission.  Prior
to construction of any temporary facility or temporary improvement, the
subdivider shall file with the city an escrow or, where authorized, a letter of
credit or other security authorized by the City Attorney, in an appropriate
amount for temporary facilities, which security shall ensure that the temporary
facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3154, § 23, 9-12-02; Ord. No. 3441, § 4,
4-13-06)
Sec. 92-73.   Enforcement of security requirements; failure of improvements to
comply.
The failure to post the security required by Section 92-72 of this chapter
(including without limitation the failure to post said security before the
filing of the associated plat and/or the sale of any lots in said plat) is a
violation of this chapter.  No permit, license or certificate authorizing the
construction, building or occupancy of any structure may be issued within a
subdivision for which the security required by this chapter has not been
posted.  In those cases where security has been posted and the regulated
improvements have not been installed or have not been installed in a manner
that complies with the provisions of this chapter and the plans and
specifications accepted by the City Engineer, the city may:
(a)   require that all the regulated improvements be installed regardless of
the extent of completion of the development at the time;
(b)   obtain funds under the security and complete the regulated improvements
itself or through a third party;
(c)   assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party,
including a subsequent subdivider of the subdivision or addition for which
regulated improvements were not constructed in compliance with this chapter, in
whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent subdivider’s promise to
complete and/or repair the regulated improvements on the tract;
(d)   place a moratorium on the issuance of any further construction permits
and/or any other permits, licenses or certificates required in the subdivision
until the satisfactory completion of the regulated improvements; and/or
(e)   exercise any other rights available under the law.

Track 3: Staff Approval of Minor Plat
Sec. 92-86.   Track 3: Staff approval of minor plat.
(a)   Definition of minor plat.  A subdivision determined to meet each of the
following requirements may be classified as "minor" and approved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this article:
   (1)   proposed lots shall front onto an existing street; and
   (2)   four or fewer lots are proposed; and
   (3)   proposed plat does not require either the construction or extension of
streets or the extension of municipal facilities; and
   (4)   proposed subdivision is not a replat.
(b)   Pre-submission proposal, plat required for minor plat.  The subdivider of
a minor plat shall cause a pre-submission proposal to be prepared as set forth
in Section 92-16 of this chapter. Upon approval of the pre-submission proposal
for a minor plat by the City Planner, the subdivider shall prepare a plat, per
Section 92-20 of this chapter, and submit said plat to the City Planner for
approval.  The minor plat shall be submitted during the submission period.
(c)   Approval authority for minor plat. The City Planner may approve a minor
plat so long as such minor plat does not require a variance, but may not
disapprove a minor plat. If a minor plat is not approved by the City Planner
before the posting deadline or if a minor plat requires a variance, the minor
plat (and variance, if one is requested) shall be scheduled for consideration
at the next available Commission meeting.  Additionally, the City Planner or
the subdivider may, for any reason, elect to present a minor plat to the
Commission for approval/disapproval/conditional approval; provided, however,
that the minor plat must be placed on the Commission agenda before the posting
deadline.  If the subdivider does not agree to conditions of approval imposed
by the City Planner, the subdivider shall submit written notice of such to the
City Planner before the posting deadline, whereupon the minor plat will be
scheduled for consideration at the next available Commission meeting.  Action
will be taken on the former minor plat as set forth in Section 92-69 of this
chapter. If the plat does not meet the requirements necessary to be considered
as a minor plat, the subdivider may resubmit the plat in accordance with the
procedures provided under Article III of this chapter (Track 1) or under
Article IV of this chapter (Track 2), whichever the subdivider shall elect.
(d)   Signing and filing of minor plat.  After the minor plat is approved by
the City Planner or by the Commission, it shall be signed as required by
Section 92-29 and filed with the County Clerk.

Required Improvements and Design Standards
Sec. 92-96.   Required improvements.
(a)   Improvements required.  The subdivider shall construct each and every
improvement required by this chapter, including without limitation, each and
every improvement required by the subdivision design standards.
(b)   Conformity with regulations required.  The regulated improvements
required by this chapter shall be installed within all of the area of any
subdivision for which the City Engineer has accepted the plans and
specifications in accordance with Section 92-24 of this chapter.  All regulated
improvements shall be designed and constructed in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.  None of the regulated improvements and no
construction of any nature on the subdivided tract shall commence until the
City Engineer has accepted the plans and specifications required by Section 92-
24 of this chapter.
(c)   Required information and markers.  It shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider to provide construction staking, cut sheets, shop drawings and
construction change orders, as-built plans, construction costs (unit price
breakdown) for all public improvements, and other information required to
complete the construction. Within 30 days after the issuance by the City
Engineer of the letter required by Section 92-25 of this chapter, certified as-
built plans shall be submitted to the city on paper and in a digital format
acceptable to the City Engineer.  If the complete and correct as-built drawings
are not submitted within the 30 days, no additional permit, certificate or
license authorizing the occupancy, construction or building of any structure or
portion of a structure within the subdivision shall be issued until such
drawings are submitted to the City Engineer.
   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to emplace permanent survey
reference monuments and lot and block corner markers.  It shall also be the
responsibility of the subdivider to replace any such monuments and corner
markers that are destroyed or removed before the completion of all regulated
improvements in the subdivision and the city’s acceptance of all public
improvements in the subdivision.  Such corners and monuments shall be of 3/4-
inch iron pipe or 5/8-inch iron rod and shall meet the following standards:
   (1)   lot corners shall be located with a half-inch iron rod 24 inches long
with the top flush with the ground.
   (2)   block corners shall be located with a 5/8-inch iron rod 36 inches long
top set flush with the ground and shall include the beginning and end of all
curves within each block.

surface of the finished ground elevation at suitable locations throughout the
subdivision.  At least two reference points shall be tied to the City of
Longview, Texas, 2002 Mapping and Monumentation Project Horizontal and Vertical
Control Network.  There shall be at least as many reference points as there are
blocks in the subdivision but not less than two, and the distance between the
successive monuments along any street or reference line shall not be greater
than 1,000 feet.  Reference points shall be other than and in addition to
markers for block or lot corners.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02)
Sec. 92-97.   Improvement standards.
The following minimum standards for regulated improvements shall apply and
shall be agreed to and complied with in each subdivision:
(a)   Pavement.  All streets shall be paved in accordance with the plans and
specifications accepted by the City Engineer of the City of Longview, Texas.
Width of paving for the various types of streets, shall be determined by the
City Engineer according to his determination of the street classification
appropriate to each street and shall not be less than the following:
   Street Type                    Pavement Section Width
   Principal arterial         66'
   Minor arterial            53'
   Collector            37'
   Local                29'
   Private street            Per fire code
(b)   Curb and gutters, water lines, sanitary sewer and drainage structures. 
Combined curb and gutters on each side of all public streets in the
subdivision, waterlines providing access to water to each lot in the
subdivision, sanitary sewer system lines providing access to sanitary sewer to
each lot in the subdivision, and drainage pipes, channels, inlets, junction
boxes and other appurtenances necessary to convey and transport surface
drainage, shall be constructed or installed in accordance with the plans and
specifications accepted by the City Engineer.  Long-side service lines shall be
installed by the subdivider for each lot on the opposite side of the street
from the water or wastewater mains.  Short-side service lines shall be
installed by the subdivider during the initial construction of the subdivision
in those instances where the flowline of the sewer main is six feet or more
below the finished grade of the curb or edge of pavement elevation. Outside of
the corporate limits of the city, the subdivider may install water wells in
place of the required waterlines where an approved public water supply is not
reasonably accessible or procurable.  Each lot in the subdivision must still
have access to water.  Outside of the corporate limits of the city, the
subdivider may install on-site sewage facilities in place of the required
sanitary sewer system lines where a public sanitary sewer system is not
reasonably accessible or procurable. Each lot in the subdivision must still
have access to a means of disposing of sewage that complies with all applicable
law.  Any water well or on-site sewage facility so installed must comply with
the plans and specifications accepted by the City Engineer.
(c)   On-site sewage facilities.  For any subdivision where an on-site sewage
facility is installed, any and all on-site sewage facilities (commonly called
“septic tanks” or “septic systems”) must meet all applicable requirements of
Texas law, including without limitation any applicable requirements of the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality or its successor agency or agencies. 
The subdivider must show proof that the county in which said subdivision is
located has found that any necessary on-site sewage facilities will not violate
the state regulations that the county is required to enforce.  The City
Engineer may require such inspections and proof of compliance with this
subsection as the City Engineer deems appropriate.
(d)   On-site water supply systems.  For any subdivision where water wells are
installed, any water wells or other water supply systems must meet all
applicable requirements of Texas law, including without limitation any
applicable requirements of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality or its
successor agency or agencies.
(e)   Fire hydrants.  Fire hydrants shall be installed in the proposed
subdivision in a manner that complies with the requirements of the fire code.
(f)   Street lights.  Street lights shall be installed by the subdivider at the
intervals recommended by the city’s franchised electric utility supplier or at
other intervals as determined by the City Engineer.
(g)   Applicable design standards.  Each and every regulated improvement and
public improvement shall meet the applicable design standards of the
subdivision design standards.
(Ord. No. 3124, § 3, 5-23-02; Ord. No. 3241, § 7, 8-28-03; Ord. No. 3525, § 39,
6-14-07)
Sec. 92-98.  Design standards for streets.
(a)   Conformity to general plan and other considerations.  The arrangement,
character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to
the general plan for the city and shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets.  All streets shall be installed in
the proposed subdivision in a manner that complies with the requirements of the
fire code, and public streets shall comply with the Design Guidelines for
Subdivision Street Improvements in Longview, Texas.
(b)   Arrangement of streets not in general plan.  Where such is not shown in
the general plan for the city, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision
shall either:
   (1)   provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding area; or
   (2)   conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other
conditions made continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical.
(c)   Local street alignment.  The alignment of local streets shall be such
that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
(d)   Arterial streets.  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed minor arterial street or principal arterial, the Commission may
require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting
contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots
with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
through and local traffic.
(e)   Certain rights-of-way.  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a
railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the Commission
may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-
of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land,
as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial
purposes in appropriate districts.  Such distances shall also be determined
with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade
separations.
(f)   Reserve strips.  Reserve strips controlling access to public streets
shall be prohibited except where approved by the Commission.
(g)   Street jogs.  Streets shall not be designed with jogs with centerline
offsets of less than 150 feet.
(h)   Reverse curve on certain streets.  A tangent at least 100 feet long shall
be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
(i)   Intersections.  Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles.  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of 20 feet or a greater radius where the Commission may deem it necessary.
(j)   Right-of-way widths for public streets.  Right-of-way widths for public
streets shall be as shown in the general plan for the city and where not shown
therein shall be not less than as follows, except where excessive cuts or fills
will require additional right-of-way:
   Street            Right-of-way Width
   Principal arterial         100'
   Minor arterial              80'
   Collector              60'
   Local                 50'
(k)   Cul-de-sacs and residential subdivisions.  Cul-de-sacs and residential
subdivisions shall be designed in accordance with the following requirements:
   (1)   Subdivisions in districts designated for single-family use by the
zoning ordinance and with a single point of access to a collector, minor
arterial street or principal arterial shall not be designed to serve more than
60 dwelling units.  Appropriate road widths shall be provided in accordance
with Section 92-97(a).  Secondary emergency vehicle access shall be provided in
accordance with the fire code.
      In certain circumstances, a single-family residential subdivision
containing more than 60 lots that would utilize a single means of access may be
approved, upon determination by the Planning and Zoning Commission that the
subdivision is designed in a manner that will incorporate accepted urban design
principles relative to the design and arrangements of street and lots in order
to minimize negative traffic and safety impacts.  The developer shall submit
supporting information such as proposed estimated traffic volume based on
accepted ITE trip rates, location of nearest emergency response bases, and
details of any features of the subdivision intended to mitigate traffic or
emergency access problems.
   (2)   The length of a cul-de-sac (dead-end) street in a single family
subdivision is limited to 1,600 linear feet. In all other subdivisions, the
cul-de-sac shall not exceed 500 feet in length. Cul-de-sac street length shall
be measured from a point beginning at the intersection of the cul-de-sac street
with the center line of the street from which it extends and continuing
thereafter along the center line of the cul-de-sac street to the center point
of the turn-around at the end of the cul-de-sac street.
   (3)   Cul-de-sac streets that are 150 feet in length or longer shall be
designed at the closed end with a turn-around (cul-de-sac) having an outside
pavement diameter of a minimum of 95 feet and a street property line diameter
of a minimum of 117 feet.  Cul-de-sac streets that are less than 150 feet in
length shall be designed at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside
pavement diameter that is a minimum of 77 feet and a street property line
diameter that is a minimum of 100 feet.  For a cul-de-sac street of any length,
if a greater minimum outside pavement diameter or street property line diameter
is required by the fire code, as amended, the minimum diameter shall be as
specified in the fire code.  If an existing dead-end street with no cul-de-sac
meeting current standards stops at the proposed subdivision's boundary, and the
proposed subdivision is not going to extend the street, then the subdivider
shall construct a cul-de-sac meeting current standards.
(l)   Street grades.  Street grades shall be established with due regard to
topography, contemplated land use, adjacent facilities surrounding the land to
be subdivided, as well as the Master Drainage Plan.  The minimum street grade
shall be 0.70%.
(m)   Flood design.  The flood design section for streets shall be taken from
back of curb to back of curb, provided that in no case shall the height of
curbs for subdivisions be more than six inches.  The top of curb elevation for
streets with curbs shall not be below the 100-year floodplain elevation as
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The top-of-
pavement elevation for streets without curbs shall not be below the 100- year
floodplain elevation as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
(n)   Stricter standards.  The City Engineer may require that a particular
street, portion of a street, or intersection meet stricter (higher) standards
than those set forth in this chapter if, in the professional opinion of the
City Engineer, such stricter standards are necessary based on a sight-distance
study and/or traffic impact analysis performed in accordance with the
requirements of Section 92-18 of this chapter.  Failure or refusal to comply
with any such stricter standards shall be grounds for disapproval of the plat.

Sec. 92-99.   Design standards for alleys.
Where public alleys are provided, they shall meet the following requirements:
(a)   The minimum width of pavement in a public alley shall be 20 feet and the
minimum width of the right-of-way for a public alley shall be 30 feet.
(b)   Public alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be
avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit
safe vehicular movement.
(c)   Dead-end public alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if
unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the
dead-end, as determined by the Commission.

(a)   Easements required; width of same.  Easements across lots or centered on
rear and/or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and
shall be at least 15 feet wide.  The Commission may require a wider easement
width if more than one utility line is located in an easement, if a utility

there is any such invalidity, error, mistake, irregularity or illegality in any
assessment or in the proceedings prior thereto with reference to such
improvement, the City Council shall make the necessary correction to determine
the amount justly and lawfully payable by them in accordance with the
proceedings with reference to such improvement; provided, that in no case shall
any amount be assessed against any such owner or his property in excess of the
special benefit to his property in the enhanced value thereof by means of such
improvement.
(Code 1943, Art. 54-10)
Sec. 94-35.  Notice required prior to reassessment.
Before any such reassessment shall be made the governing body shall by
resolution declare the necessity thereof and the name or names of the then
owners of property affected thereby, and a description of the property proposed
to be reassessed by lot or block number, front foot or any description
sufficiently identifying same, and shall in general terms state the nature of
the defects, irregularities, mistakes or illegalities to be corrected and the
total amount, and amount per front foot of property proposed to be reassessed
against each of said owners. Said resolution shall set a time and place at
which a hearing shall be given before the City Council to such owners, their
agents or attorneys, or any interested party, and shall direct the City
Secretary to give notice thereof to all owners, lien holders and other
interested parties by publication for the time and in the manner provided in
the Charter for giving notice to property owners and other interested parties
with reference to an original assessment of their property for improvement of
highways in the city, and the terms of the Charter as to the giving of such
original notices shall govern and control the form and method of giving notice
provided by this article as far as possible, and the date of the first
publication of such notice.
The City Council may provide for the giving of further and additional notice,
but the notice by publication shall, in all cases, be sufficient and binding,
whether any additional notice be given, or if given, be for any reason
defective, and by such published notice the real and true owners of the
property to be reassessed shall be legally and sufficiently notified.
(Code 1943, Art. 54-11)
Sec. 94-36.  Hearing; plan of reassessment; provisions for payment and lien;
certificates.
When notice has been given, as provided in Section 94-35, at the time and place
mentioned in the resolution referred to in Section 94-35 to the owners of
property proposed to be reassessed, their agents or attorneys, or any
interested parties, as to all matters affecting said property or the benefits
thereto of such improvement, or any invalidity, irregularity or illegality in
any of the proceeding with reference to the making of said improvements or any
claim of liability, and said owners and interested parties may interpose any
other objections to such reassessment, and the special benefits of said
improvements to said property may be inquired into, determined and contested.
Such owners and interested parties, their agents and attorneys shall file their
objections in writing and thereafter the City Council shall hear and determine
the same, and full opportunity shall be given to the persons filing such
objections to produce evidence, subpoena witnesses and to appear in person or
by attorney, and a full and fair hearing thereof shall be given by the city,
which hearing may be adjourned from day to day and from time to time without
further notice until all have been fully heard, and the City Council shall have
the power to inquire into and determine all facts necessary to the adjudication
of such objection and the ascertainment of special benefits to such owner or
owners by means of such improvements, and shall determine from the evidence
before it and other facts in its possession the amount, if any, which shall be
reassessed against any owner and his property, and shall correct all the
errors, mistakes or irregularities in the proceedings before had with reference
to such improvements, and shall by ordinance make reassessment. Any objection
to the regularity of the proceedings, or to the validity of any reassessment or
adjudication of personal liability against such property and the owners
thereof, shall be deemed waived, unless presented at the time and in the manner
herein specified.
Subject to the terms hereof, the amount to be reassessed against each owner and
his property shall be in accordance with the front foot plan or rule, that is,
in the proportion of the cost of the original improvement that the front feet
of property of each owner to be reassessed is to be the total frontage of
property abutting on the highway or portion thereof improved, but if, in the
opinion of the governing body, the strict application of this rule would in any
particular case result in inequality or injustice, then such rule or
apportionment shall be adopted as will in the opinion of the governing body
provide substantial justice and equality, taking into consideration the burden
imposed upon owners of property abutting upon the improvement and the special
benefit received by them.
The reassessment ordinance shall provide the manner and terms and time of
payment of such reassessment and the rate of interest charged thereon, and
shall provide that amounts reassessed, together with interest and cost of
collection, and reasonable attorney fees when incurred, shall be secured by a
first and prior lien upon the property against which they are reassessed,
superior to all other liens, claims or titles except lawful ad valorem taxes,
and that the sum so reassessed shall constitute a personal liability of the
owner of the property against which said reassessment shall be made.
The ordinance shall also provide for the issuance of assignable certificates
against the property so reassessed and its owners for the enforcement of said
reassessments in the same manner as provided in the original assessment
ordinance for such improvement, and such certificate shall have the same force
and effect as to such reassessment as valid original certificates had as to
such original assessments.
(Code 1943, Art. 54-12)
Sec. 94-37.  Appeal.
At any time within ten days after the hearing provided for in Section 94-36 has
been concluded, any person having any interest in any real estate which may be
subject to reassessment under such resolution, or otherwise having any
financial interest in such improvement or improvements, or in the manner in
which the cost of such reassessment is to be paid, who may desire to contest on
any ground the validity of any proceeding that may have been bad with reference
to the making of such improvement or the validity in whole or any part of any
such reassessment, lien or personal liability fixed by any of such proceedings,
may institute suit for that purpose in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any
person who shall fail to institute such suit within such period of ten days, or
who shall fail to diligently prosecute such suit in good faith to final
judgment, shall be forever barred from making any such contest or contests, or
defense in any other action, and this estoppel shall bind their heirs,
administrators, successors and assigns.
The city and the person to whom is let the contract for the making of the
original improvement for which such reassessment is made, shall be made
defendants in such suit or any other proper parties may be joined therein, and
the petition in such suit shall comply with all the formalities required by,
shall be verified in the manner required by and shall be subject to all the
terms of the provisions of the Charter of this city with reference to such
suits in original assessment proceedings.
(Code 1943, Art. 54-13)
Sec. 94-38.  Assessments not invalidated by mistakes, etc.
No mistake, irregularity, omission or failure to assess or reassess any
property or person liable for any part of the cost of any improvement shall
invalidate any reassessment made under the terms of this article unless such
mistake or irregularity or omission or failure to assess or reassess would have
invalidated an original assessment for such improvement under the terms of the
Charter.
(Code 1943, Art. 54-14)
Sec. 94-39.  Time taxes due.
All city ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable on October first of the year
for which levied, and shall become delinquent at midnight of January thirty-
first of the following year, and upon becoming delinquent, a penalty of ten
percent shall be added and interest at the rate of six percent per annum

year until all the taxes are paid, and that such lien shall be prior and
superior to all other liens and claims.

As used in this article, the following words and terms have the following
meanings:
   Applicable law means all lawfully enacted and applicable federal, state, and
city laws, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, and orders as the same may be
amended or adopted from time to time.
   Basic service tier. A basic service tier shall, at a minimum, consist of the
following: All signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of sections
614 (47 U.S.C. 534) and 615 (47 U.S.C. 535) of the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended. Each such tier shall also include any public, educational and
governmental access programming required by the franchise of the cable system
to be provided to subscribers; and any signal of any television broadcast
station that is provided by the cable operator to any subscribers (except a
signal which is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier beyond the local
service area of such station), plus any additional video programming signals
the cable operator desires to be added to the basic tier.
   Cable service means (a) the one-way transmission to subscribers of (i) video
programming, or (ii) other programming service, and (b) subscriber interaction,
if any, which is required for the selection or use of such video programming or
other programming service.
   Cable system means a facility, consisting of a set of closed transmission
paths and associated signal generation, reception, and control equipment that
is designed to provide cable service which includes video programming and which
is provided to multiple subscribers within the city. Such term shall not
include (a) a facility that serves only to retransmit the television signals of
one or more television broadcast stations; (b) a facility that serves
subscribers without using any public right-of-way; (c) a facility of a common
carrier which is subject, in whole or in part, to the provisions of Title II of
the Communications Act of 1934, except that such facility shall be considered a
cable system (other than for purposes of section 621(c)) to the extent such
facility is used in the transmission of video programming directly to
subscribers; (d) any facilities of any electric utility used solely for
operating its electric utility systems; (e) an open video system that complies
with the requirements of the Cable Act. A reference to a cable system refers to
any part thereof, including, without limitation, converters. The foregoing
definition of cable system shall not be deemed to circumscribe or limit the
valid authority of the city to regulate or franchise the activities of any
other telecommunications system or provider of telecommunications services to
the full extent permitted by law.  Any franchise agreement shall define the
services any franchisee is authorized to provide.
   Cable system operator means any person, group of persons, firm or
corporation (a) who provides cable service over a cable television system and
directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such
cable system, or (b) who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any

organized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas and its city
Charter, and the area within its territorial limits.
   City Council or Council. Wherever the words Council or City Council are
used, they shall be construed to mean the City Council of the City of Longview,
Texas.
   Communications Act of 1934 means the legislation passed by Congress in 1934
that established a national telecommunications goal of high quality,
universally available telephone service at reasonable cost.  The Act also
established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 have all
amended the Communications Act of 1934 as newer telecommunications technologies
and national policies have evolved.
   Federal Communications Commission  or FCC.  That federal agency as presently
constituted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor
agency.
   Franchise means a non-exclusive authorization granted in accordance with
this article and exercised in accordance with a franchise agreement to install
cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, and other devices
necessary and appurtenant to the construction, operation, and maintenance of a
cable system along the public rights-of-way within all or a portion of the city
to provide cable service. Any such authorization, in whatever form granted,
shall not mean or include: (i) any other permit or authorization required for
the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the city
required by the ordinances and laws of the city; (ii) any permit, agreement,
franchise for non-cable services, or authorization required in connection with
operations on public streets or property including, without limitation, permits

performing other work in or along public rights-of-way; or (iii) express or
implicit authorization to provide cable service to, or install a cable system
on, private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible
easements pursuant to section 621(a)(2) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. section 541
(a)(2).

be exercised.
   Franchise area means the area of the city that a grantee is authorized to
serve by its franchise agreement.
   Grantee. A natural person, partnership, domestic and or foreign corporation
or entity, association, joint venture or organization of any kind granted a
franchise by the City Council under this article and its lawful successor,
transferee or assignee.
   Gross revenues means all amounts, which are charged and/or received,
directly or indirectly, by a grantee from or in connection with the operation
of the cable system to provide cable services including, without limitation:
Any revenue received from subscribers, including but not limited to revenue for
basic service, expanded basic service, other tier services, additional outlets,
FM service, commercial service, premium channel service, pay-per-view service
and related per-event services, or for the distribution of any other cable
service over the system, including internet access and related internet
services, or the provision of any service-related activity in connection with
the operation of the system.
Revenue received from subscribers for installation, change in service and
reconnection charges and similar fees.
Revenue received from subscribers for converters, remote controls or other
equipment leased or rented to subscribers in connection with the delivery of
cable services to such subscribers.
Revenue received from subscribers for service charges and late fees
attributable to delinquent accounts.
Revenue received from third parties, including advertising revenue, tower
rental revenues, home shopping commissions, guide commissions, leased access
payments, and studio and other facilities or equipment rentals.
Revenue shall include any payment or consideration (including copyright and
franchise fees, but excluding any utility users tax or new sales tax imposed by
the city, state, or federal government) collected for direct payment to a third
party.  Franchise fees paid to the city are not deemed to be taxes and are not
to be deducted from the total gross revenue figure on which franchise fees are
paid.
Gross revenues shall include amounts collected from subscribers for franchise
agreement fees in accordance with the Court of Appeals decision resolving the
case commonly known as the Dallas or Baltimore case, In re: United Artists
Cable of Baltimore, 11 FCC Rcd 18,158 (FCC 96-188, April 26, 1996); reversed by
the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sub nom City of Dallas
v. FCC. 119 F/ 3d 917 (5th Cir 1997).
Gross revenue shall also include the gross revenue of any other person which is
derived directly or indirectly from or in connection with the operation of a
system to the extent that said revenue is derived, through a means which has
the effect of avoiding the payment of franchise fees to the city that would
otherwise be paid herein.
There shall be deducted from gross revenue:
   (1)   Bad debts written off by grantee in the normal course of its business,
provided, however, that bad debt recoveries shall be included in gross revenue.
   (2)   Refunds made to subscribers or other third parties.
In computing gross revenue from sources other than a grantee's subscribers,
including without limitation, revenue derived from the sale of advertising,
home shopping services, guide sales, the lease of channel capacity on its cable
system, or any other such revenues derived from the operation of the cable
system, the amount of such revenues attributable or allocated to grantee in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for the purpose of
determining gross revenues, shall be the aggregate revenue received by grantee
from such other sources during the period in question multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of grantee's subscribers in the city
as of the last day of such period and the denominator of which shall be the
number of subscribers within all areas of such period.
   Person means an individual, partnership, association, joint stock grantee,
organization, corporation, or any lawful successor thereto or transferee
thereof, but such term does not include the city.
   Public rights-of-way means the surface, the air space above the surface, and
the area below the surface of any public street, highway, lane, path, alley,
sidewalk, boulevard, drive, bridge, tunnel, parkway, waterway, easement, or
similar property in which the city now or hereafter holds any property
interest, which, consistent with the purposes for which it was dedicated, may
be used for the purpose of installing and maintaining, a cable system. No
reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to a public rights-of-way
shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its
interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to
permit its use for such purposes, and a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only
those rights to use as are properly in the city and as the city may have the
undisputed right and power to give.
   Subscriber. Any person who legally receives any service delivered over a
cable system.
   Total number of subscribers means the number of subscribers determined as
follows: In the event a single fee is paid for service to a multiple dwelling
unit the number of equivalent subscribers shall be determined by dividing such
fee by the then prevailing basic service tier rate and rounding the resulting
quotient to the nearest whole number.  To this number shall be added the number
of all other subscribers.
The definitions contained in this article rely on those contained in the
Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. Section 521 et seq.), as it is from time
to time amended and interpreted. Any ambiguity shall be resolved by reference
to the federal statutes, regulations and the decisions interpreting the same.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99)
Sec. 95-2.  General provisions.
(a)   Scope of city's authority. The city may grant one or more franchises, and
each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of this article.
(b)   Franchise required. A franchise is required of any person desiring to
construct, operate and maintain a cable system within all or any portion of the
city. A franchise may be granted by the City Council to any person, whether
operating under an existing franchise or not, who or which offers to furnish
and provide such cable system under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of
this article and a franchise agreement acceptable to the Council. The grant of
a cable franchise is not an authorization to provide other services nor is it a
bar to the imposition of other compensation requirements.
(c)   Rights reserved to city. The city hereby expressly reserves the following
rights:
   (1)   To exercise its governmental powers, now or hereafter, to the full
extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the city.
   (2)   To adopt and promulgate ordinances as it shall find reasonably
necessary in the exercise of its lawful police power. Such power shall include
all rights the city may have under 47 U.S.C. section 552 and the absolute right
of the city to manage the public rights-of-way and to adopt such regulations
relating to the management of the public rights-of-way as the city and/or its
departments shall provide. Nothing in a franchise agreement shall be deemed to
waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the city
regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction.
      The powers of the city may be exercised through amendment of this article
as well as through enactment of separate ordinances and regulations.
(d)   Unlawful acts; penalties. It shall be unlawful for any person to
establish, operate or carry on the business of distributing to any persons in
the city any television signals or radio signals by means of a cable system
unless a franchise therefore has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions
of this article, and unless such franchise is in full force and effect.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to make any unauthorized connection,
whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with
any part of a franchised cable system within the city for the purpose of
enabling himself or herself or others to receive any television signal, radio
signal, picture, program or sound, without payment to the owner of the cable
system.
   It shall be unlawful for any person without the consent of a grantee, to
willfully tamper with, remove or injure any cables, wires or equipment used for
distribution of television signals, radio signals, pictures, programs or sound.
   Any person violating any subsection of this section shall be punished by a
fine or by imprisonment or by both fine and imprisonment in accordance with
federal, state or local law; provided further that, subject to any state or
federal law imposing a higher penalty, violation of this article as specified
in this subsection (d) is hereby declared a misdemeanor and upon adjudication
of guilt thereof, any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or
refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of the provisions of this
subsection (d) shall be assessed a fine for each offense in accordance with
Section 1-4 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Longview, Texas. Each day
that a violation is permitted to exist shall be deemed a separate offense for
which a separate fine may be assessed.
(e)   Failure of city to enforce compliance. A grantee shall not be excused
from complying with any of the provisions of this article or the terms and
conditions of a franchise agreement by any failure of the city, upon any one or
more occasions, to insist upon the grantee's performance or to seek grantee's
compliance with any of the provisions of the ordinance or terms or conditions
of a franchise agreement.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99)
Sec. 95-3.  Requirements for issuing new cable television franchises.
(a)   Application non-refundable fee.  An application for a new cable
television franchise (not a franchise renewal) shall be submitted to the
Council, or its designee, in accordance with the procedures established by the
Council.  The application will contain facts and information the Council deems
appropriate.  Applications shall be accompanied by a standard, nonrefundable
application fee set by resolution of the City Council to the order of the City
of Longview which amount shall be used by the city to offset direct expenses
incurred in the franchising and evaluation procedures, including, but no
limited to staff time and consulting assistance.
(b)   Grantee to pay costs of granting franchise. An applicant to whom the
Council grants a nonexclusive franchise, in addition to the nonrefundable fee
specified hereinabove, shall pay to the city, within 30 days of receipt of
notice of the amount, an amount set by the Council, or its designee, which
shall represent the remaining out-of-pocket costs incurred by the city, in
granting the franchise and not defrayed by fees forthcoming from the provisions
of subsection (a) of this section.
(c)   Procedure required by city to process an application and/or require a
request for proposals.
   (1)   Upon receipt of an application, the city may either: (i) evaluate the
application pursuant to Section 95-3(c)(4) conducting such investigations as it
deems necessary; or (ii) issue a request for proposals after conducting, if
necessary, a proceeding to identify the future cable related needs and
interests of the community.  Any such request for proposals shall be provided
to the person applying for an initial franchise and made available to any other
interested party.  The request for proposals may contain a proposed franchise
agreement.
   (2)   An applicant shall respond to a request for proposals by filing an
application within the time directed by the city that contains the information
and material set forth in Section 95-3(d), application requirements. The
procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in the request for
proposals shall be followed by each applicant. Any applicant that has already
filed an application need not refile the same materials with its response to
the request for proposals, but must supplement its application to include any
additional or different information or material required of the request for
proposals. The city or its designee may seek additional information from any
applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information.
   (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 95-3(a) and (b), a person
may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application
containing the information required in Section 95-3(d), (application
requirements) and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to
Section 95-3(c)(4). Prior to evaluating such an application, the city may
conduct such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the
application satisfies the standards set forth in Section 95-3(c)(4). The city
may seek additional applications.
   (4)   In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city shall consider,
among other things, the following factors:
      a.   whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal
qualifications to provide cable service;
      b.   whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the city and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-
related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of
meeting such needs and interests;
      c.   whether, to the extent not considered under Section 95-3(c)(2),
above, the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support;
      d.   whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and
private property that would be affected by the cable system, including the
extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require
replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or
use of the public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the
ability of the existing franchisee, if any, to meet the cable related needs and
interests of the community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of
competing applications; and
      e.   what effects a grant of a franchise may have on competition in the
delivery of cable service in the city.
   If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise
after considering the factors set forth above, and subject to the applicant's
entry into a franchise agreement, it shall issue a franchise.  If the city
denies an application for an initial franchise, it will issue a written
decision setting forth its reasons for denial.  Prior to deciding whether or
not to issue a franchise, the city will hold one or more public hearings or
implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an
application may be received.  The city may reject any application that is
incomplete or fails to respond to a request for proposals.  This section is not
intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any applicant standing to
challenge the denial of its application or the issuance of a franchise to
another.
(d)   Application requirements. Ten copies of the application shall be filed
with the City Secretary and shall contain such information as the city may
require, including but not limited to:
   (1)   a general description of the applicant's proposed operation;
   (2)   a statement detailing its business or corporate organization;

production facilities and equipment to be made available by the applicant for
access; and a statement establishing any additional revenues to be designated
for programming or programming assistance for the access channels;
   (6)   if applicant is a corporation, audited financial statements for the
five previous fiscal years. If applicant is a partnership, copies of the "U.S.

   (7)   an estimated five year operations proforma which shall include the
initial and continuing plan investment, annual profit and loss statements
detailing income and expenses, annual balance sheets, and annual levels of
subscriber penetration. The proforma shall also state the average return on
investment anticipated by the applicant for the five year operations period and
shall state the method of computation thereof. Costs anticipated for voluntary
services or contributions shall, if presented, be incorporated in the proforma
as required in this article, but shall be separately identified in the
proforma;
   (8)   a list of existing franchises held by the applicant indicating when
the franchises were issued and when the systems were constructed in each
respective governmental unit, together with the name and address and phone
number of a responsible governmental official knowledgeable of the applicant;
   (9)   a statement detailing the applicant's prior operational experience in
cable television systems and/or microwave service, including that of its
officers, management and any staff to be associated with the proposed
operation;
   (10)   a general statement of the applicant's ability and intent to
incorporate technological improvements and advancements in the cable television
system as such improvements or advancements are generally available in the
industry; and
   (11)   any other reasonable and applicable information which the City
Council may request;
   (12)   a demonstration of the applicant's technical ability to construct
and/or operate the proposed cable system, including identification of key
personnel and their qualifications;
   (13)   a demonstration of the applicant's legal qualifications to construct
and/or operate the proposed cable system, including but not limited to a
demonstration that the applicant meets the following criteria:
      a.   the applicant must not have had an application for an initial or
renewal franchise in the city lawfully denied within the three years preceding
the date its current application was submitted;
      b.   the applicant must not have had any cable television franchise
lawfully revoked by any franchising authority within three years preceding the
submission of the application;
      c.   the applicant must have the necessary authority under Texas law to
operate a cable system;
      d.   the applicant must have the necessary authority under federal law to

that it is qualified to obtain, any necessary federal franchises or waivers
required to operate the cable system proposed;
      e.   the applicant shall not have been convicted, at any time during the
ten years preceding the submission of the application, of any act or omission
of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully
with the city and the subscribers, or to substantially comply with its lawful
obligations under applicable law, including obligations under consumer
protection laws and laws prohibiting anticompetitive acts, fraud, racketeering,
or other similar conduct;
      f.   the applicant shall not have filed materially misleading information
in its application or have intentionally withheld information that the
applicant lawfully is required to provide; and
      g.   an elected official of the city shall not hold a controlling
interest in the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant.
      Not withstanding the foregoing, the city shall provide an opportunity to
an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by
virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps
taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their
recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the
remoteness of the matter from the operation of its cable systems.
   (14)   identification of the area of the city to be served by the proposed
cable system, including a description of the proposed franchise area's
boundaries;
   (15)   if the applicant proposes to provide cable service to an area already
served by an existing franchisee, the identification of the area where the
overbuild would occur and the ability of the public rights-of-way and other
property that would be used by the applicant to accommodate an additional cable
system; and
   (16)   an affidavit or declaration of an authorized officer of the applicant
certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application,
acknowledging the enforceability of application commitments, and certifying
that the application meets all federal and state law requirements.
(e)   Request for proposals, public comment, evaluating applications. Upon
filing, any franchise application and related documents are public records open
to inspection by the public during reasonable hours, including specifically the
regular business hours of the City Secretary.
   Before issuance of a request for proposals, the city shall maintain the
proposed request for proposals on the agenda of at least two City Council
meetings for the purpose of determining any special local needs or interest. 
Any citizen of the city shall have the right to comment in writing, filed in
advance, or orally at any meeting at which the proposed request for proposals
is to be considered.
   Following reasonable notice to the public, any franchise application shall
be available for inspection for a period of at least twenty days prior to the
City Council taking action on the same. Any citizen of the city shall have the
right to comment in writing, filed in advance, or orally and in writing at any
meeting at which the franchise applications are to be considered.
   At its discretion, the City Council may refer any application for a
franchise to a city board or commission with appropriate jurisdiction to review
and make recommendations to City Council regarding the sufficiency of the
application and the applicant's qualifications.
   Before authorizing the negotiation of any such franchise agreement, the City
Council shall review the board or commission's recommendations and findings, if
any, the applicant's legal, financial and technical qualifications and the
adequacy and feasibility of the applicant's qualifications to operate a cable
television system within the city based upon information provided to the City
Council by the applicant and by other sources in writing or at any public
hearing or meeting of the City Council, and shall conduct at least one public
hearing thereon at a regularly scheduled City Council meeting.
   Thereafter, the City Council may in its discretion authorize the negotiation
of a franchise agreement with any applicant determined to be qualified. The
City Council may in its discretion refer the actual negotiation of any such
franchise to a board or commission, ad hoc or otherwise, to return a proposed
franchise agreement acceptable to the applicant and in the city's best interest
for final consideration by the City Council.
(f)   Awarding a franchise. After examining all applications submitted pursuant
to procedures to be established by the City Council designed to assure the
legal, financial and technical qualifications of an applicant to provide cable
service, and any franchise agreement negotiated between the city and any
approved applicant, the Council is authorized to grant a nonexclusive franchise
or franchises conveying the right to construct and operate a cable system
within the public ways of the city.  A franchise may be awarded to an applicant
or applicants which in the Council's judgment will best serve the public
interest and whose construction and financial plans and arrangements are both
feasible and adequate to fulfill the conditions set forth in this article and
incorporated into any franchise granted. Any franchise agreement shall be
finally approved in conformance with the requirements of Section 12.02 of the
City Charter.
   No provision in this article shall be deemed or construed to require the
Council to grant a franchise following receipt of any franchise application.
(g)   Franchise term. The term of a franchise shall be for the number of years
negotiated in the franchise agreement with the city, not to exceed 25 years,
unless terminated earlier in accordance with this article, the franchise
agreement, or the City Charter.
(h)   Franchise fees. Grantee shall pay city five percent of gross revenue as a
franchise fee.
   The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly to the city. The grantee shall
file a complete, accurate, and verified statement listing each and every type
of revenue included in the gross revenue collected as a result of its doing
business within the city during the period for which said quarterly payment is
made.  Such payment shall be made to the City Treasurer not later than 30 days
after the end of each calendar quarter and 60 days after the end of each
calendar year.
   City may examine all applicable records of the grantee to determine accuracy
of amounts payable to city.
   The city shall have the right to audit and to re-compute any amounts
determined to be payable under this article; provided, however, that (i) such
audit shall take place within 36 months following the close of each of the
grantee's fiscal years and (ii) if grantee has underpaid the franchise fee for
the audit period, the grantee shall pay the cost of the audit. Any additional
amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days
following written notice to the grantee by the city; said notice shall include
a copy of the audit report.
   In the event that any franchise fee payment or re-computed amount is not
made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, and following
notice by the city to a grantee, interest shall be charged daily from such date
at the annual rate equivalent to the then existing prime rate of the city's
depository bank plus two percent.
(i)   Grantee to be bound by terms and conditions of cable ordinance and
franchise agreement; procedure if conflict. No franchise shall be valid until
grantee enters into a franchise agreement having terms and conditions
acceptable to the city.
   In the event of a conflict between the franchise agreement and the
provisions of this article the provisions of this article shall prevail.
Failure to provide services as promised in grantee's franchise may be deemed a
breach of this article to which the provisions of Section 95-17 and Section 95-
18 of this article shall apply.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99; Ord. No. 3242, § 17, 8-28-03)
Sec. 95-4.  Transfers and assignments.
(a)   Grantee shall offer city prior opportunity to purchase system. In the
event of a bonafide offer to purchase a grantee that is a publicly traded or
publicly held corporation, as a part of an overall sale of the parent grantee
or a separate sale of the grantee itself, whether by sale of stock, assets,
consolidation, merger, or other vehicle of transfer, the city shall have a
right of first refusal whereby the city shall have 60 days from the date of
receipt by the city of written notice of the pending sale (including a copy of
the offer itself and all relevant details thereto) in which to match said
bonafide offer of purchase (including that portion explicitly identified of any
offer to purchase the parent grantee as allocable only to the purchase of the
grantee), on the same terms and conditions as contained in the original offer.
In the event of a bonafide offer which proposes the transfer of the majority
voting interest in a grantee that is other than a publicly held corporation,
the city shall have 60 days from the date of receipt by the city of written
notice of the pending offer (including a copy of the offer itself and all
relevant details thereto) in which to match said bonafide offer on the same
terms and for the same price as the then tendered offer. Any offer of purchase
must be in writing and acceptable to the grantee to be considered bonafide.
(b)   Prior written consent of city required before any sale, assignment, or
transfer of a franchise. A franchise and any rights or obligations of the
grantee under the franchise shall not be sold, assigned, or transferred, either
in whole or in part, or leased or sublet in any manner, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or tangible or
intangible property therein (tangible property being defined as more than 25
percent of the tangible property of the grantee located in the city either
cumulatively or at any one time), pass to or vest in any person without prior
written consent of the city as required in this chapter and Section 12.02 of
the City Charter, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(c)   Prior written consent of the city required before any transfer of
ownership or control of grantee. Ownership or control of grantee shall not be
transferred without the prior written consent of the city.
(d)   Grantee to submit application documenting information required by the
city. A grantee shall promptly notify the city of any action or proposed action
requiring consent of the city pursuant to Sections 95-4(b) through 95-4(n) of
this article.
   A grantee shall submit to the city an original application and four copies,
unless otherwise directed, which application shall fully describe the terms and
conditions of the action or proposed action subject to this section and clearly
state the basis on which the application should be approved. The application
shall also contain all documentation to support the showings required under
Sections 95-4(e) and 95-4(f).
   At any time during the review process, the city reserves the right to
require additional supporting documentation from a grantee or any other person
involved in the action or proposed action to support the showing required of
grantee under Sections 95-4(e) and 95-4(f).  A grantee shall provide all
requested assistance to the city in connection with any such inquiry and, as
appropriate, shall secure the cooperation and assistance of all other persons
involved in such action.
   The city shall respond to any application requiring the city's consent under
Sections 95-4(b) through 95-4(n) within 120 days after such application, and
all information required by the city under this article, the grantee's
franchise agreement, and applicable law in connection with the application, has
been received by the city. The city may deny such an application on, among
other grounds, a grantee's failure to submit the information required by this
article, grantee's franchise agreement and applicable law.
(e)   Showings required of proposed assignee; assignee must agree to conditions
prescribed by city. A proposed assignee or transferee must demonstrate that it
possesses the legal, financial and technical qualifications necessary to
perform all the terms, conditions and obligations under the grantee's franchise
agreement for the remaining term thereof, and such reasonable additional
obligations required of the assignee or transferee by the city for the specific
and limited purpose of assuring the performance by the assignee or transferee
of all the terms, conditions and obligations of the franchise agreement, and,
in connection with this purpose, a proposed assignee or transferee must provide
the following information:
   (1)   Legal qualifications. The application shall identify the proposed
assignee or transferee and, if the proposed assignee or transferee is not a
natural person, each of its officers, directors or shareholders owning or
beneficially holding percent or more of its outstanding voting shares, general
partners and limited partners holding an equity interest in the proposed
assignee or transferee of five percent or more, and the respective percentage
share of each such identified officer, director, shareholder or general or
limited partner. The proposed assignee or transferee shall disclose any pending
administrative, legal, equitable or dispute resolution proceeding before, or
adverse final action taken during the past three years by any court,
administrative body or arbitrator with respect to the proposed assignee,
transferee or its officers, directors, or other persons having an equitable
interest in five percent or more of the voting stock of such transferee or
assignee in a civil, criminal, administrative or equitable proceeding brought
under the provisions of any law or regulation related to the following: any
felony; revocation, suspension or involuntary transfer of any authorization
(including cable franchises) to provide video programming or other
communication services; antitrust or unfair competition; fraudulent statements
to a governmental unit; material breach of a cable franchise agreement,
including but not limited to a material failure to provide PEG access channels,
facilities or equipment; or final rate regulation proceeding in which the
proposed rate was not sustained.
   (2)   Financial qualifications. The proposed assignee or transferee must
demonstrate that it has sufficient net liquid assets on hand or available from
committed resources to consummate the transaction and operate the grantee's
cable system for six months. The application for transfer shall include recent
financial statements, including audited financial statements if available, of
the proposed assignee or transferee prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, including balance sheets, income and expense
statements, capital expenditure statements and accompanying notes for the past
three years. Such statements, if not otherwise publicly available, may be
designated as confidential and shall be maintained as such by the city to the
extent permissible under state and local law.
   (3)   Technical qualifications. The application shall set forth a narrative
account of the proposed assignee's or transferee's technical qualifications,
experience and expertise regarding cable cystems. The narrative account shall
include, but not be limited to, a list of the cable systems currently and
formerly owned or operated by assignee or transferee within the past three
years; summary information concerning appropriate management personnel that
will be involved in the management and operation of the assignee's or
transferee's cable system; a list of any material violations of the technical
rules of the FCC or of federal, state or local governments, including but not
limited to violations of rules and regulations regarding signal quality, safety
and construction cited during the past three years by a franchising authority
or by local, state or federal governments involving currently or formally owned
or operated cable systems.
   (4)   Customer service. The assignee or transferee must submit to the city
(i) a reasonably detailed narrative describing, or a representative manual (if
such a manual exists) containing, assignee's or transferee's customer service
procedures; (ii) copies of at least two representative annual customer notices
provided by other systems owned or operated by assignee or transferee; (iii) a
summary of assignee's or transferee's proposed billing procedures; (iv) a
sample customer service bill which assignee or transferee proposes to use in
grantee's system, and (v) a copy of a sample customer service complaint log or
form, printed out from an electronic or computerized complaint recording
system, which assignee or transferee proposes to use in grantee's system.
   (5)   Compliance with franchise agreement and cable ordinance. The proposed
assignee or transferee must agree to comply with all provisions of the
grantee's franchise agreement and the cable ordinance, as well as such
reasonable additional terms and conditions as the city may require for the
specific and limited purpose of assuring the proposed assignee's or
transferee's compliance with such provisions, including without limitation such
additional terms and conditions as the city may require to remedy or avoid the
recurrence of any past violations of the terms of a franchise or of federal,
state or local laws in the operation of grantee's, assignee's or transferee's
cable system or service.
(f)   Grantee and assignee or transferee to assist city in its inquiry of
prospective controlling party; grantee promptly to notify city of any actual or
prospective change in control of franchise.
   (1)   Grantee's responsibility. A grantee shall assist the city in its
inquiry into an assignee's or transferee's capabilities under Section 95-4(e).
   (2)   Assignee's or transferee's responsibility. In seeking the city's
consent to any change in ownership or control of a franchise, a grantee,
assignee or transferee shall have the responsibility to establish, to the
satisfaction of city, that assignee or transferee has all of the legal,
financial, and technical qualifications necessary to perform all of the terms,
conditions and obligations of the grantee under its franchise agreement for the
remaining term thereof.  The city may request, and assignee or transferee shall
provide, all reasonable financial data relative to the transfer, including but
not limited to the materials specified in Section 95-4(e) of this article. In
addition, assignee or transferee shall provide to the city the terms and
conditions of the sale, credit agreements, partnership agreements and any other
information reasonably related to the assignee's or transferee's acquisition of
the grantee's franchise which is needed to clarify the change in ownership.
(g)   Transfer of control occurs with change of ten percent of voting interest
or of person exercising management authority over grantee.  For purposes of
this Section 95-4, "control" means the ability to exert working control, in
whatever manner exercised, over the affairs of a grantee, either directly or
indirectly.
   A rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred, including of
control in fact (i.e. transfer of de facto control), shall arise upon the
acquisition or accumulation by any person, or group of persons, of 10 percent
of the voting interest of a publicly held grantee, or of 25 percent of the
voting interest of a privately held grantee or of the person exercising
management authority over such a privately held grantee (unless 51 percent of
the voting interest of a privately held corporation continues to be owned by
the same ownership).
(h)   Transfer or assignment without prior consent deemed to be material
breach, and may be subject to liquidated damages.  Any transfer or assignment
of a franchise or of ownership or control of grantee without the prior consent
of the city shall be null and void unless later ratified by the city and shall:
(i) be deemed a material breach of a franchise agreement and (ii) among and/or
in addition to other remedies available to the city, be subject to a liquidated
damages assessment, on a daily basis, until the transfer or assignment is
approved, or if not approved, until the prior ownership, control or other
status quo is restored to a condition satisfactory to the city.
(i)   City may revoke franchise if unauthorized transfer or assignment occurs.
If the city fails to approve or denies its consent to any such transfer or
assignment of a franchise or of the ownership or control of a grantee and such
action has nevertheless been effected, the city may revoke a franchise and
terminate a franchise agreement unless control of the grantee or the system is
promptly restored to its status prior to such unauthorized action or to a
status acceptable to the city.
(j)   Consent of city to transfer or assignment shall not constitute waiver of
city rights. The consent or approval of the City Council to any transfer or
assignment of a franchise or of ownership or control of a franchise shall not
constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city unless the city
specifically releases or waives such rights.
(k)   No transfer or assignment to be approved within three years or prior to
completion of grant, construction or acquisition.In the absence of compelling
circumstances, the City Council will not approve any transfer of control of a
grantee or assignment of a franchise or cable system within three years of its
initial grant or construction or acquisition, respectively. The following
transactions, assignments or transfers are exempt from this section: (i) a tax-
free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code; (ii) an assignment or
transfer of control of a cable system which is required by law or by any act,
order or decree of any federal agency or any state or political subdivision and
which does not also require the prior consent of the city; (iii) an assignment
or transfer of control to one or more purchasers, assignees or transferees
controlled by, controlling or under control with, the seller, assignor or
transferor; or (iv) an assignment of a franchise or transfer of control of a
grantee, which assignment or transfer has otherwise been approved by the city,
in which the franchise was renewed less than three years prior to the proposed
date of such assignment or transfer, provided that the grantee has continuously
operated such a cable system under the franchise and any prior franchises for a
period of at least three years prior to such an assignment or transfer.
(l)   Grantee must notify city of any agreement to transfer or assign cable
system and terms of sale. A grantee must notify the city whenever it reaches a
definitive written agreement to sell, transfer or assign its cable system, or
any portion thereof. A grantee must also notify the city of the terms and
conditions of any proposed sale as required by Section 95-4(f).
(m)   Successor-in-interest must become signatory to an agreement. In no event
shall an assignment of a franchise or a transfer of ownership or control be
approved without the successor-in-interest becoming a signatory to the existing
franchise agreement.
(n)   Grantee not to enter into any management contract if it results in a
change of control.  A grantee shall not enter into any management contract or
other arrangement for the management of the system, to the extent that such
contract or other arrangement would result in a significant change of
operational control of a grantee or the system (as defined in Section 95-4(g)),
without the prior consent of the city.
(o)   Processing fee may be imposed by city. The city may impose a processing
fee upon the grantee and/or the assignee or transferee to cover its costs of
considering and evaluating an application for assignment or transfer of a
franchise.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99)
Sec. 95-5.  Liability and indemnification.
(a)   Indemnification of the city.  The grantee shall save the city and its
agents and employees harmless from and against all claims, damages, losses, and
expenses, including attorney's fees sustained by the city on account of any
suit, judgment, execution, claim or demand whatsoever arising out of but not
limited to copyright infringements and all other damages arising out of the
installation, operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of the cable television
system authorized in a franchise agreement.
(b)   Reimbursement of costs. A grantee shall pay all expenses incurred by the
city defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties mentioned in
Section 95-5(a) above.
(c)   Public liability insurance. A grantee shall maintain throughout the term
of the franchise or any renewal or extension thereof, a general comprehensive
liability insurance policy issued by an insurer with an A- or better rating of
insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, authorized to
do business in the State of Texas, naming as the additional insured the city,

relieve a grantee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed
to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right
or remedy it may have.
(g)   Construction bond. Prior to any cable system construction, upgrade, or
other work in the public rights-of-way, a grantee shall establish in the city's

the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-
way in a safe, timely, and competent manner in accord with the provisions of a
franchise agreement, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the
principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a
result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost
of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee, or the cost of
completing or repairing the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work
in the public rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees,
up to the full amount of the bond. The city may also recover against the bond
any amount recoverable against the letter of credit where such amount exceeds
that available under the letter of credit.

the public rights-of-way and payment of all construction obligations of the
cable system to the satisfaction of the city, the city may eliminate the bond
or reduce its amount after a time appropriate to determine whether the work
performed was satisfactory, which time shall be established considering the
nature of the work performed. The city may subsequently require a new bond or
an increase in the bond amount for any subsequent construction, upgrade, or
other work in the public rights-of-way.
   The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with an A- or better rating
of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition and shall be
subject to the prior approval of the city.

the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until 60 days
after receipt by the city, by registered mail, of written notice of such intent
to cancel or not to renew."

percent of the other cities' systems. In addition, the grantee shall provide
the city with a 24 hour emergency telephone number at which a designated (not

regulate the grantee's rates for cable service to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.
(b)   Current rate schedule to be filed with city: 30 days notice required

ensure nondiscrimination, shall provide the city with a complete schedule of
all current basic service and enhanced service rates and charges, including pay
TV and pay-per-view rates and charges, and (subject to other requirements
specified in the materials referenced in Section 95-14(e)) shall give 30 days
prior notice from the date of mailing to the city and to all affected
subscribers of any pricing changes or additional charges, excluding temporary
marketing and sales discounts or offers.  Forty-five days before any price
changes or additional charges are to take effect, a grantee shall provide the
city with a copy of the proposed notification for subscribers so that the city
may review the text of the notice to assure accuracy of information being
presented to subscribers.
(c)   Grantee to furnish service to each person in franchise area making
request for service. Grantee shall furnish and maintain cable service to each
person within the franchise area who makes a bona fide request to receive such
service that is based upon the requirements of this ordinance and/or a
franchise agreement. Nothing in a franchise agreement shall limit the right of
the grantee to deny service to any person which has a negative credit or
service history with the grantee, which may include non-payment of bills or
theft or damage to the grantee's equipment, or who has threatened or assaulted
employees of the grantee in the course of their employment. Provided that in
the event service is denied, the grantee will give written notice to the person
requesting service of his or her right to appeal to the city the grantee's
decision to deny service, and of the city's authority to reverse the grantee's
decision in instances where the grantee has acted unreasonably.
(d)   Basic service charges must be applied on nondiscriminatory basis. All
charges for basic service must be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis. A
grantee may, however, conduct promotional campaigns in which rates are

(e)   City adopts rate regulation procedures consistent with FCC rules. The
city hereby adopts by reference rules of the Federal Communications Commission
set forth in Subpart (n) (Cable Rate Regulation) of Part 76 (Cable Television
Service) of Chapter I of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulation regarding
the regulation of cable television rates for basic service and associated
equipment, as amended.
   After a grantee has submitted for review its existing rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment costs or a proposed increase in these
rates, the grantee shall publish a public notice of the rates and costs giving
interested parties, including the grantee, a reasonable opportunity to file
written comments which shall be available in the offices of the City Secretary
for public inspection and copying during normal business hours.
   The city adopts by reference procedures set forth in 47 CFR Section 459
regarding confidential business information submitted by the Grantee in a rate
regulation proceeding.
   A grantee which willfully or repeatedly fails to comply with a rate
regulation or refund order directed specifically at the grantee shall be
subject to a monetary forfeiture as determined by the city, not to exceed
$10,000.00 for failure to comply with a rate regulation and $50,000.00 for
failure to comply with a refund order.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99)
Sec. 95-15.  Franchise renewal process.
The franchise renewal process of the city shall be in accordance with Section
626 (47 U.S.C. 546) Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and with all other
applicable state and federal laws, this article, the existing franchise
agreement, and the City Charter.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99)
Sec. 95-16.  Letter of credit.
(a)   Grantee is required to file an irrevocable letter of credit. Within 30
days after the effective date of a franchise, grantee shall deposit with the
city an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount set forth in the franchise
agreement and issued by a local federally insured commercial lending
institution that has been approved by the city.  The form and substance of said
letter of credit shall be subject to the approval by the City Attorney. The
letter of credit shall be used to assure: the faithful performance by the
grantee of all provisions of the franchise agreement and the cable ordinance;
compliance with all orders, permits and directions of the City Manager or any
agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the city having
jurisdiction over any aspect of the grantee's performance under a franchise and
this article; and the payment by the grantee of any penalties, liquidated
damages, claims, liens, franchise fees, taxes or other fees due to the city
which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the
cable system, including cost of removal of any property of the grantee.
(b)   Letter of credit may be drawn upon by the city after following specified
procedure that assures due process to grantee. The letter of credit may be
drawn upon by the city by presentation of a draft at sight on the lending
institution, accompanied by a written certificate signed by the City Manager
certifying that the grantee has failed to comply with the franchise agreement
and/or this article, stating the nature of the noncompliance, and stating the
amount being drawn.  Examples of the nature of the noncompliance for drawing
upon the letter of credit include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (1)   failure of the grantee to pay to the city any franchise fees, taxes,
liens or other fees after ten days written notice of delinquency;
   (2)   failure of the grantee to pay to the city after ten days written
notice, any amounts due and owing by reason of the indemnity provisions of
Section 95-5;
   (3)   failure of the grantee to pay to the city any liquidated damages due
and owing pursuant to a franchise agreement;
   (4)   failure to make any payment required by an agreement within the time
fixed therein;
   (5)   failure to pay to the city within ten working days after receipt of
written notice, any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the city has been
compelled to pay or incur by the reason of any material act or default by the
grantee;
   (6)   failure to comply within ten working days after receipt of written
notice from the city, with any material provisions of an agreement or cable
ordinance which the city reasonably determines can be remedied by an
expenditure of an amount from the letter of credit or other instrument.
   In the event of such noncompliance, the city may order the withdrawal of the
appropriate amount of liquidated damages, penalties, fees or otherwise from the
letter or other instrument for payment to the city, provided that, prior to
each such withdrawal; (i) the grantee shall be afforded an opportunity to cure
any of said failures within 30 days after written notice from the city that the
withdrawal is to be made; or (ii) if such cure cannot be reasonably
accomplished within such 30 days, then the grantee shall have a reasonable time
to cure, provided that the grantee commences such cure within such 30 days and
diligently pursues such cure to completion.
(c)   Letter of credit shall be replenished to original amount following any
draw down. Grantee shall structure the letter of credit in such a manner so
that if the city at any time draws upon the letter of credit, the amount of
available credit shall automatically increase to the extent necessary to
replenish that portion of the available credit exhausted by the honoring of the
draft. The intent of this subsection is to make available to the city at all
times a letter of credit in the amount specified in the franchise agreement.
(d)   The city's rights with respect to letter of credit are in addition to
other rights. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the letter of
credit are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by a
franchise agreement or authorized by law, and no action or proceeding against a
letter of credit shall affect any other right the city may have.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99)
Sec. 95-17.  Liquidated damages.
(a)   Parties shall agree to specific liquidated damages to be paid by grantee
for certain delays or nonperformance. A grantee's failure to comply with any
timing or performance requirements set forth in a franchise agreement will
result in damage to the city, the amount of which will be impracticable to
ascertain. Therefore, the city and the grantee will negotiate the amount of
liquidated damages to be set forth in a franchise agreement. Every franchise
agreement shall provide that the city's recovery of such damages shall be
without prejudice to any other remedy the city may have.
(b)   Procedures established to assure grantee of due process and opportunity
to cure problem before damages assessed. If the City Manager, following prior
reasonable notice to a grantee to cure any problem that might result in
liquidated damages, concludes that a grantee is liable for liquidated damages
pursuant to the franchise agreement, he/she shall issue to grantee by certified
mail a notice of intention to assess liquidated damages. The notice shall set
forth the basis of the assessment, and shall inform the grantee that liquidated
damages will be assessed from the date of the notice unless the assessment
notice is appealed for hearing before the City Council and the Council rules
(a) that the violation has been corrected, or (b) that an extension of the time
or other relief should be granted. If the grantee desires a hearing before the
Council, it shall send a written notice of appeal by certified mail to the City
Manager within ten days of the date on which the City Manager sent the notice
of intention to assess liquidated damages. After the hearing, if the Council
sustains in whole or in part the City Manager's assessment of liquidated
damages, the City Manager may at any time thereafter draw upon the letter of
credit required by Section 95-15. Unless the Council indicates to the contrary,
said liquidated damages shall be assessed beginning with the date on which the
City Manager sent the notice of intention to assess liquidated damages and
continuing thereafter until such time as the violation ceases, as determined by
the City Manager.
(Ord. No. 2801, § 3, 2-25-99)
Sec. 95-18.  Forfeiture and termination.
(a)   Franchise may be terminated for material breach of terms and conditions;
examples given. In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the
city, the city reserves the right to terminate a franchise and all rights and
privileges of the grantee in the event of a material breach of this article or
a franchise agreement. A material breach by a grantee shall include, but shall
not be limited to, the following:
   (1)   violation of any material provision of the cable ordinance or
franchise agreement or any material rule, order, regulation or determination of

the cable system;
   (3)   failure to begin or complete cable system construction, reconstruction

such interruption is obtained from the City Manager;
   (5)   substantial failure to satisfy the requirements regarding system
characteristics or repeated failure to meet the technical performance standards
specified in a franchise agreement;
   (6)   abandonment of the system, in whole or in material part, without the
prior written consent of the city;
   (7)   substantial failure to supply the access channels and other support
and any related services, equipment and facilities as required in a franchise
agreement;
   (8)   substantial and repeated failure to comply with the consumer service
standards and requirements set forth in the cable ordinance and a franchise
agreement;
   (9)   any material misrepresentation, made by or on behalf of a grantee in
its proposal to obtain a franchise, or in connection with the negotiation or
re-negotiation of, or any amendment or other modification to a franchise
agreement, to the extent that any such misrepresentation was relied upon by the
city;
   (10)   there is made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or an
appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the grantee,
whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the
benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless the conditions set
forth in Section 95-18(e)(1) and (2) are fulfilled.
(b)   Procedures outlined leading to possible termination of franchise. The
City Manager may make a written demand that a grantee comply with any
provision, rule, order, or determination under or pursuant to the cable
ordinance or a franchise agreement. If the violation breach, failure, refusal
or neglect by a grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such
written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken
or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the City Manager may place the
issue of termination of a franchise before the City Council. The City Manager
shall cause to be served upon grantee, at least 20 days prior to the date of
such City Council meeting, a written notice of intent to request such
termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given
of the meeting and the issue which the City Council is to consider.
(c)   City Council shall hear and consider issues and determine if a violation
has occurred. The City Council shall hear and consider the issue and shall hear
any person interested therein, and shall determine, whether or not any
violation by a grantee has occurred. The City Council may delegate to any
board, commission, committee or city official any responsibilities or duties
reserved to the Council under this article.
(d)   City Council may declare franchise terminated if compliance does not
occur within specified period. If the City Council shall determine the
violation by a grantee was the fault of the grantee and within its control, the
City Council, may, by ordinance, declare that the franchise of the grantee be
terminated, unless there is compliance within such period as the City Council
may fix.
(e)   Franchise may cease and terminate 120 days after appointment of
receivers. Any franchise granted shall, at the option of city, cease and
terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee
or trustees to take over and conduct the business of grantee whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
   (1)   such receivers or trustees shall have within 120 days, after their
election or appointment fully complied with all the terms and provisions of
this article and a franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivers or
trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all defaults under the
franchise; and,
   (2)   such receivers or trustees shall have within 120 days executed an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction, whereby such
receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term,
provision, and limitation of the franchise agreement.
(f)   Procedure if a foreclosure occurs.In the case of a foreclosure or other
involuntary sale of the plant, property, and equipment of grantee, or any part
thereof, city may serve notice of termination upon grantee and to the purchaser
at such sale, in which event the franchise and rights and privileges of grantee
shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of such notice unless:
   (1)   city has approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner
in this ordinance provided; and
   (2)   such successful purchaser shall have covenanted and agreed with city
to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise
agreement.

(a)   Rights to purchase. In addition to the right of first refusal and the
procedure to exercise same set out in Section 95-4(a) herein, in the event the
grantee forfeits or city revokes this franchise for cause, or when the renewal
of the franchise has been denied pursuant to the renewal procedures in the
federal law, the city shall have all rights to acquire ownership of the cable
system as are specified in federal law in 47 U.S.C. 547.
(b)   Franchise valuation. Under circumstances where the grantee forfeits the

article.
(d)   The rights granted by this article are subject to all franchises and

the city by other public utility or public service corporations. It is not
intended by the grant of a franchise to abridge the exercise of the police
power heretofore or hereafter granted to the city by the state.  The grant of a
franchise is subject to all ordinances and resolutions or agreements adopted by
the City Council as the same now exist or may be hereafter amended, revised or
codified, in the lawful exercise of any other power granted to the city.
(e)   Specific mention of the materiality of any of the provisions herein is
not intended to be exclusive of any others for the purpose of determining
whether any failure of compliance hereunder is material and substantial.
(f)   If any particular section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, or clause of
this article, or the particular application thereof, shall be held invalid, the

regardless of such repeal, except as otherwise provided herein or in any

(j)   The rights and remedies reserved to the city by this article are
cumulative and shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other
rights or remedies which the city may have with respect to the subject matter
of this article.  A waiver of any right or remedy by a party at one time shall
not affect the exercise of said right or remedy or any other right or other
remedy by such party at any other time. The failure of the city to take any
action in the event of a material breach by the grantee shall not be construed
or otherwise be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right of the city to take
such action at any other time in the event that said material breach has not
been cured, or with respect to any other material breach by the grantee.
(k)   In the event that, after the effective date of this article, any court,

requires the grantee either to: (a) perform any act which is inconsistent with
any provision of the article or (b) cease performing any act required by any
provision of the article, the city shall reasonably determine whether said
declaration or requirement has a material and adverse effect on the article. 
When the grantee intends to exercise its rights pursuant to such declaration,
the grantee shall so notify the city of said declaration or requirement.
(l)   The headings contained in this article and any franchise agreement are to
facilitate reference only, do not form a part of this article or any franchise

terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and
pedestrians as follows:
(1)   Green alone or Go.

place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be
applicable except as to those provisions which, by their nature, can have no

public nuisance and the city is hereby empowered to remove the same or cause

   (2)   if the vehicle is registered in another state or county, the owner’s
address as shown on the motor vehicle registration records of the department or
agency of the other state or county analogous to the Texas Department of
Transportation.
(d)   A notice of violation issued under this article shall contain the
following:
   (1)   a description of the violation alleged;
   (2)   the location of the intersection where the violation occurred;
   (3)   the date and time of the violation;
   (4)   the name and address of the owner of the vehicle involved in the
violation;
   (5)   the registration number displayed on the license plate of the vehicle
involved in the violation;
   (6)   a copy of the recorded image of the violation limited solely to a
depiction of the area of the registration number displayed on the license plate
of the vehicle involved in the violation;
   (7)   the amount of the civil penalty to be imposed for the violation;
   (8)   the number of days the person has in which to pay or contest the
imposition of the civil penalty and a statement that the person incurs a late
penalty if the civil penalty is not paid or imposition of the civil penalty is
not contested within that period;
   (9)   a statement that the owner of the vehicle named in the notice of
violation may elect to pay the civil penalty by mail sent to a specified
address instead of appearing at the time and place of the administrative
adjudication hearing;
   (10)   information that informs the owner of the vehicle named in the notice
of violation:
      a)   of the owner's right to contest the imposition of the civil penalty
against the person in an administrative adjudication;
      b)   that imposition of the civil penalty may be contested by submitting
a written request for an administrative adjudication hearing before the
expiration of the period specified;
      c)   that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability for
the penalty in a timely manner is an admission of liability and a waiver of the
owner's right to appeal the imposition of the civil penalty; and
      d)   that failure to pay the civil penalty within the prescribed time
without timely contesting liability shall result in the imposition of a late-
payment fee.
   (11)   a statement that a recorded image is evidence in a proceeding for the
imposition of a civil liability;
   (12)   that the failure to timely pay the civil penalty may result in the
county assessor-collector or the Texas Department of Transportation to refuse
to register a motor vehicle alleged to have been involved in the violation; and
   (13)   any other information deemed necessary by the department.
(e)   A notice of violation under this article is presumed to have been
received on the 5th day after the date of notice of violation is mailed.
(f)   In lieu of issuing a notice of violation, the department may mail a
warning notice to the owner.
Sec. 97-166.   Administrative adjudication hearing.
(a)   A person who receives a notice of violation may contest the imposition of
the civil penalty by requesting in writing an administrative adjudication of
the civil penalty within thirty (30) days after the date the notice of
violation was mailed.  Upon receipt of a timely request, the department shall
notify the person of the date and the time of the administrative adjudication
hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after the date of the
department's receipt of the request.  The administrative adjudication hearing
shall be held before a hearing officer appointed by the city.  Said hearing
officer shall have the authority to administer oaths and issue orders
compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.
(b)   The civil penalty, late fees and costs described in this article shall
not be assessed if after a hearing, the hearing officer enters a finding of no
liability.
(c)   Failure to pay a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner
is an admission of liability in the full amount of the civil penalty assessed
in the notice of violation, and is a waiver of the right to appeal.
(d)   In an administrative adjudication hearing, the issues must be proved at
the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence.  The reliability of the
photographic traffic signal enforcement system used to produce the recorded
image of the violation may be attested to in an administrative adjudication
hearing by affidavit of an officer or employee of the city or the entity with
which the city contracts to install or operate the system and who is
responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system.  An affidavit of an
officer or employee of the city that alleges a violation based on an inspection
of the pertinent recorded image, is admissible in a proceeding under this
article and is evidence of the violation alleged in the notice of violation.
(e)   A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing
or who requests an administrative adjudication hearing and thereafter fails to
appear at the time and place of the hearing is liable for administrative
hearing costs in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) in addition to the
amount of the civil penalty assessed for the violation.  A person who is found
liable for a civil penalty after an administrative adjudication hearing shall
pay the civil penalty and costs within thirty (30) days of the hearing.
(f)   It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability
under this article, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that:
   (1)   the traffic control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently
legible to an ordinarily observant person;
   (2)   the operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the
lawful order or direction of a police officer, firefighter, or other person
authorized by local, state or federal law to direct or control traffic;
   (3)   the operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the
traffic control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately
approaching authorized emergency vehicle;
   (4)   the motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency
vehicle under Chapter 546 of the Texas Transportation Code and that the
operator was acting in compliance with that chapter;
   (5)   the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person
other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner;
   (6)   the license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was
a stolen plate and being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor
vehicle for which the plate had been issued;
   (7)   the presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually
hazardous road conditions existed and would make compliance with this article
more dangerous under the circumstances than non-compliance;
   (8)   the person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of
the motor vehicle at the time of the violation; or
   (9)   the person was arrested or issued a citation and notice to appear by a
peace officer for a violation of Section 544.007(d) of the Texas Transportation
Code.
(g)   To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a
stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen
plate, or to rebut the presumption that the owner of the vehicle committed the
violation as provided for in Section 97-168, the owner must submit proof in the
form of an affidavit, through testimony at the administrative adjudication
hearing, or by a written declaration under penalty of perjury.  If the motor
vehicle was stolen or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a
stolen plate, then proof that the theft was timely reported to the appropriate
law enforcement agency must also be submitted at the time of the administrative
adjudication hearing.  The affidavit or written declaration may be submitted by
mail to the city or the entity with which the city contracts for purposes of
this article.
(h)   Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, a person who
fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely
manner is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation
if:
   (1)   the person submits a written request for the hearing to the hearing
officer, accompanied by an affidavit that attests to the date on which the
person received the notice of violation; and
   (2)   the written request and affidavit are submitted to the hearing officer
within 30 days after the person received the notice of violation.
(i)   A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing
may appeal that finding of civil liability to a judge of the municipal court by
filing an appeal petition with the clerk of the municipal court accompanied by
payment of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a notarized statement of personal
financial obligation.  The notice of appearance must be filed on or before the
31st day after the date on which the hearing officer entered the finding of
liability for the civil penalty.
   (1)   The municipal court clerk shall schedule a hearing and notify the
owner of the motor vehicle and the department of the date, time and location of
the hearing.
   (2)   An appeal stays enforcement and collection of the civil penalty
imposed against the owner of the motor vehicle until the matter is adjudicated
by the municipal court.
   (3)   An appeal under this section shall be determined by the court by trial
de novo.  All evidence submitted at the administrative hearing shall be
admitted at the trial, along with any additional relevant evidence.
Sec. 97-167.   Order.
(a)   The hearing officer at any administrative hearing under this article
shall issue an order stating:
   (1)   whether the person charged with the violation is liable for the
violation; and
   (2)   the amount of any civil penalty, cost, or fee assessed against the
person.
(b)   The orders issued under subsection (a) must be signed and dated by the
hearing officer and may be filed with the City Secretary, who shall keep the
orders in a separate index and file.  The orders may be recorded using
microfilm, microfiche, or electronic data processing techniques.
Sec. 97-168.   Presumptions.
(a)   It is presumed that the owner of the motor vehicle committed the
violation alleged in the notice of violation mailed to the person if the motor
vehicle depicted in a photograph or digital image taken by a photographic
traffic signal enforcement system belongs to the owner of the motor vehicle.
(b)   If, at the time of the violation alleged in the notice of violation, the
motor vehicle depicted in a photographic or digital image taken by a
photographic traffic enforcement system was owned by a person in the business
of selling, renting, or leasing motor vehicles, or by a person who was not the
person named in the notice of violation, the presumption under subsection (a)
is rebutted on the presentation of evidence establishing that the vehicle was
at the time:
   (1)   being test driven by another person;
   (2)   being rented or leased by the vehicle's owner to another person; or
   (3)   owned by a person who was not the person named in the notice of
violation.
(c)   The presentation of evidence under subsection (b) by a person who is in
the business of selling, renting, or leasing motor vehicles or did not own the
vehicle at the time of the violation must be made by affidavit, through
testimony at the administrative adjudication hearing, or by a  written
declaration under penalty of perjury.  The affidavit or written declaration may
be submitted by mail to the city or the entity with which the city contracts
for purposes of this ordinance.
(d)   If the presumption established by subsection (a) is rebutted under
subsection (b), a civil penalty may not be imposed on the owner of the vehicle
or the person named in the notice of violation, as applicable.
(e)   If at the time of the violation alleged in the notice of violation, the
motor vehicle depicted in the photograph or digital image taken by the
photographic traffic signal enforcement system was owned by a person in the
business of renting or leasing motor vehicles and the vehicle was being rented
or leased to an individual, the owner of the motor vehicle shall provide to the
city or the entity with which the city contracts for purposes of this
ordinance, the name and address of the individual who was renting or leasing
the motor vehicle depicted in the photograph or digital image and a statement
of the period during which that individual was renting or leasing the vehicle. 
The owner shall provide the information required by this subsection not later
than the 30th day after the date the notice of violation is received.  If the
owner provides the required information, it is presumed that the individual
renting or leasing the motor vehicle committed the violation and the city or
contractor may send a notice of violation to that individual at the address
provided by the owner of the motor vehicle.
Sec. 97-169.   Effect of liability; exclusion of civil remedy.
(a)   The imposition of a civil penalty under this article is not a criminal
conviction for any purpose.  The failure to pay a civil penalty may not be
reported to a credit bureau as defined by Section 392.001 of the Texas Finance
Code.
(b)   A civil penalty may not be imposed under this article on the owner of a
motor vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or was issued a
citation and notice to appear by a peace officer for the same violation of
Section 544.007(d) of the Texas Transportation Code.
(c)   An owner who fails to pay the civil penalty or to timely contest
liability for the penalty is considered to admit liability for the full amount
of the civil penalty stated in the notice of violation mailed to the person.
(d)   The City Attorney is authorized to file suit to enforce collection of any
civil penalties, fees and costs imposed under this article.
(e)   Failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely
manner constitutes an admission of liability in the full amount of the civil
penalty and fees stated in the notice of violation and a waiver of the right to
appeal the imposition of such civil penalty and fee.  The failure to appear at
an administrative adjudication hearing after having requested a hearing in a
timely manner constitutes an admission of liability in the full amount of the
civil penalty, fees and costs, as stated in the notice of violation and a
waiver of the right to appeal the imposition of such civil penalty, fees and
costs.
Sec. 97-170.   Use of funds.
(a)   Not later than the 60th day after the end of the city's fiscal year,
after deducting the amounts the city is authorized by subsection (b) to retain,
the city shall:
   (1)   send 50 percent (50%) of the revenue derived from civil or
administrative penalties collected by the city under this section to the
Comptroller for deposit to the credit of the regional trauma account
established under Section 782.002 of the Texas Health and Safety Code; and,
   (2)   deposit the remainder of the revenue in a special account in the
city's treasury that may be used only to fund traffic safety programs,
including pedestrian safety programs, public safety programs, intersection
improvements, and traffic enforcement.
(b)   The city may retain an amount necessary to cover the costs of:
   (1)   purchasing or leasing equipment that is part of or used in connection
with the photographic traffic signal enforcement system in the city;
   (2)   installing the photographic traffic signal enforcement system at sites
in the city, including the costs of installing cameras, flashes, computer
equipment, loop sensors, detectors, utility lines, data lines, poles and
mounts, networking equipment, and associated labor costs;
   (3)   operating the photographic traffic signal enforcement system in the
city, including the costs of creating, distributing, and delivering violation
notices, review of violations conducted by city employees, the processing of
fine payments and collections, and the costs associated with administrative
adjudications and appeals; and
   (4)   maintaining the general upkeep and functioning of the photographic
traffic signal enforcement system.

(a)   The following definitions shall apply in this section:
   (1)   The term "City Engineer" shall mean the City Engineer of the City of
Longview, Texas, and shall also include anyone designated by the City Engineer
to carry out or aid in the execution of one or more of the City Engineer's
duties or powers under this section.
   (2)   The term "corporate limits" shall mean the boundaries of the City of
Longview, Texas, including without limitation, any area that may be annexed
into said city after the effective date of this section.
   (3)   The term "extraterritorial jurisdiction" shall mean the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city as established in accordance with
Chapter 42 of the Texas Local Government Code.
   (4)   The term "facilities" shall mean any structure or structures used to
supply water service or wastewater service.
   (5)   The term "Planning and Zoning Commission" shall mean the Planning and
Zoning Commission of the City of Longview, Texas.
   (6)   The term "special utility district" shall mean a special utility
district operating under Chapter 65 of the Texas Water Code and any officer,
employee, contractor or agent working on behalf of such a district.
   (7)   The term "subdivision design standards" shall have the meaning
assigned in Chapter 92 of this Code.
(b)   This section shall apply within the corporate limits of the city and
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city.
(c)   A special utility district shall construct all facilities in accordance
with the plans and specifications approved in advance by the City Engineer.
(d)   Before beginning the construction of any facilities, a special utility
district shall submit to the City Engineer the number of complete sets of plans
and specifications of such construction as the City Engineer shall require, not
to exceed six sets.  Said plans and specifications shall show such features as
dimensions and specifications of facilities to be constructed, showing proposed
position on the ground, specifications of materials and construction, and plan-
profile maps of all water lines and wastewater lines showing both ground
surface and flow line, and any other pertinent information required by the City
Engineer.  These plans and specifications must be prepared by a professional
engineer in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices and shall
be drafted in accordance with all requirements and standards set forth in
Chapter 92 of this Code for plans and specifications of facilities of the same
type.
(e)   The City Engineer shall not approve plans and specifications for any
facilities constructed by a special utility district that do not comply with
all applicable requirements of federal and state law, with all the requirements
of this section, and with all city ordinances relating to facilities of the
same type, including without limitation, the standards for water and wastewater
facilities set forth in the city's subdivision design standards.  The City
Engineer shall approve plans and specifications that comply with all such
requirements.
(f)   The City Engineer is entitled to inspect any and all facilities being
constructed by a special utility district at any time during the construction
or after the completion of the facilities in order to determine whether or not
the facilities are constructed in accordance with the requirements of this
section.  After the completion of any facilities of a special utility district,
if said facilities are constructed in accordance with the requirements of this
section and with the plans and specifications previously approved by the City

specifications and the facilities will not comply and detail the rationale for
a variance from the requirement.  Where the Planning and Zoning Commission
finds that extraordinary hardships may result from requiring strict compliance
with this section, the Planning and Zoning Commission may vary the requirements
of this section so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured; provided that such variation shall not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these regulations.  Such variance and modifications
as may be granted shall require approval by a simple majority of the Planning
and Zoning Commission present.  Any thing in this section to the contrary
notwithstanding, no variance or modification shall be granted for any
applicable state or federal law or regulation.

comply with the plans and specifications approved by the City Engineer as
required by this section.  It shall be a violation of law to construct or to
commence construction of any facilities without first obtaining the approval of
plans and specifications required by this section.  It shall be a violation of
law to refuse to allow the City Engineer to inspect any facilities subject to
the requirements of this section.  Any violation described in this section
shall be punishable by a fine as set forth in Section 1-4 of this Code.
(j)   Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, or in state law as
adopted, allegation and evidence of culpable mental state are not required for
the proof of an offense defined by this section.
(k)   In addition to any penalties provided herein for violation of this
section, the City Attorney is authorized, without further action of the City
Council, to pursue any and all remedies available at law or in equity for the
enforcement of this section, including without limitation the initiation and
prosecution of any court or administrative proceeding necessary or convenient
to prevent or halt the construction of any facilities in violation of this
section or to enforce the City Engineer's authority to inspect facilities under
this section.
(l)   Nothing in this section authorizes a special utility district to
construct facilities or provide service within the corporate limits of the
city, within the area served by the city under the city's certificate of
convenience and necessity or within any area in which the special utility
district is not authorized by law to construct facilities or provide service.

Article II.
Water System
Division 1.
Generally
Sec. 106-15.  General provisions and regulations.
For the convenience of the consumer, and as a measure of safety to the service,
the following regulations are made a part of this article:
(1)   Stop and waste cock. Consumers shall install an approved "stop and waste
cock" inside the property line, at the base of each riser pipe, and at
locations accessible in case of emergency, and shall not use the curb cock at
meter in lieu thereof.
(2)   Check valve. If, in the judgment of the city, the placing of an approved
check valve on the property side of a water meter serving any consumer is
considered necessary for the safety of the water system, such approved check
valve shall be immediately installed at the expense of the consumer, after due
notice in writing shall have been given the consumer by the city.
(3)   Storage hot water heaters. On any premises where any character of storage
hot water heater is directly connected, a check valve shall be installed by the
consumer before water from the city water supply is used.
(4)   Interrupted service. The city shall not be liable for any damage that may
occur on account of the water being cut off for any purpose, or on account of
the breaking of any pipe or fixture by pressure of the water from the city
mains.
(5)   Shutting off water for repairs, etc. The city, at any time, may order the
water cut off from any premises connected with the city mains, without notice,
for repairs, extensions or other necessary purposes.
(6)   Exposing meters or fire hydrants to damage, moving meters or hydrants. It
shall be unlawful to build driveways or structures of any kind, in such manner
as to expose any meter or fire hydrant to damage from traffic.
   Whenever the property owner requests the moving of any meter or fire
hydrant, such cost shall be at the expense of the property owner. Application
shall be made to the city for such move, and an estimate of the cost made, and
upon deposit thereof the city shall proceed to make the change in location of
said meter or hydrant. In no case shall a fire hydrant be so moved unless the
city decides it is advisable.
(7)   Unlawful connection to service. It shall be unlawful to connect to any
water service of the city until the meter has been installed or approval of
same has been secured from the city.
(Code 1943, Art. 55-21; Ord. No. 3286, § 57, 1-22-04)
Sec. 106-16.  Water tap fees.
(a)   Policy. The City Council finds and determines that the greatest factor in
performing water service connections is the cost of setup and operation for
surface excavation and/or subsurface boring of an adjacent pavement surface
where necessary to extend the individual water service line to a city water
main. Therefore, water service fees shall reflect the difference in cost for
such excavation or boring. In those instances where a private developer or
other person shall make the required tap, the city shall install the water
meter and only the meter set charge shall apply.
(b)   Rates.  In those instances where the city shall install or cause to be
installed water service connections in the streets or alleys within the
corporate limits of the city, the city shall charge for the installation a sum
sufficient to cover the cost thereof, such sum to include the tap cost and the
meter set up charges and to be collected by the city at the rates set forth by
resolution of the City Council.
(c)    Ownership of meters.  All meters shall be owned by the city.
(d)    Warranty requirement.  All installations performed under this section by
a developer or persons other than the city shall be warrantied for a period of
one year following installation.
(Ord. No. 2955, § 5, 9-7-00; Ord. No. 3063, § 7, 9-13-01)
Sec. 106-17.  Water rates.
(a)   Treated water.  Unless otherwise provided by contract, all rates and fees
for treated water service to customers inside or outside the city limits shall
be as set by resolution of the City Council.
(b)   Raw water.  Unless otherwise provided by contract, all rates and fees for
raw water service to customers inside or outside the city limits shall be as
set by resolution of the City Council.
(c)   Intervals and conditions of payment.  The charges provided for treated
water service shall be payable at such intervals and subject to such conditions
as the City Council shall provide by resolution.
(d)   Late fees.  The City Council may, by resolution, set such conditions and
charges as it shall deem appropriate for late payment of bills for water
service, sewer service, and/or refuse (garbage and trash) collection service.
(Ord. No. 1966, 3-3-88; Ord. No. 2338, 9-9-93; Ord. No. 2496, 9-15-95; Ord. No.

Sec. 106-18.  Water rates to remain in force.
The water rates shall remain in force as provided in this article, but the City
Council may grant special contracts, and set summer rates for residents of the
city for beautification of their home yards.
(Code 1943, Art. 55-22)
Sec. 106-19.  Discontinuance to enforce provisions of chapter; additional
charges.
Failure or refusal of any person to pay any charges assessed under this chapter
or to otherwise comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be authority
for the discontinuance of such water service until all such charges are paid
and the customer is in compliance with such requirements.  In any case where it
becomes necessary to discontinue service in order to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, the city will charge a connection fee in accordance
with Section 106-26 of this chapter before water service is turned on again.
This charge shall be in addition to any other charges due.  Should the customer
reconnect or otherwise pass said discontinued service without the permission of
the city, the customer's meter will be removed and an additional charge will be
made and collected before the meter is reset.  The amount of said additional
charge shall be as set by resolution of the City Council.  Said additional
charge is in addition to the aforesaid connection fee and any other charges
due.

Sec. 106-20.  Joint consumers moving to new location.
(a)   Where there are different consumers liable for any water rent, charge,
service or bill, and one or more of such customers so liable leaves such
premises, such consumer so leaving shall not be supplied with water at the new
premises occupied by them until all accounts due by such person or persons has
been paid.
(b)   Where any consumer is liable to the city for any water rent, charge or
service, either water or sewer, he shall not be given a connection for water or
sewer, until all unpaid water or sewer rent, charge or service has been paid;
and in event he is located using water or sewer at some other place, the water
shall be turned off at the new location until all valid accounts past due are
paid.
(c)   Should any person or persons move into any premises supplied with water
from the city mains, without making written application in the manner provided
therefor, and use water, then such person or persons shall become responsible
for all water used from date of the last reading previous to their occupying
said premises and the failure to pay same shall be cause for disconnecting said
service until the amount due be paid.
(Code 1943, Art. 55-2)
Sec. 106-21.  Determination of size and type of meter.
The superintendent of the waterworks department shall determine the size and
type of meter to be installed or used on any water service.

   (19)   A user shall not discharge any medical waste except as specifically
authorized by the control authority in a wastewater discharge permit.
   (20)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any pesticide,
herbicide, or fungicide, such as, but not limited to, chlordane, heptachlor,
aldrin, diedrin, DDT, DDD, or DDE, or any other toxic, poisonous, or other
substance that may injure or interfere with the normal treatment processes or
may constitute a hazard to human, animal, or plant life, including aquatic
organisms or create any toxicity or other hazards in the POTW’s receiving
stream.
   (21)   No person shall cause any discharge prohibited by state or federal
law or regulations, including without limitation, EPA regulations.
      When the Director determines that a user(s) is contributing to the POTW
any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, the Industrial pretreatment Supervisor shall:
      a.   advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution to the POTW;
and
      b.   develop effluent limitation(s) for such user(s) to correct the
interference with the POTW.
C.   Compliance Schedule.
     In order to remedy or avoid a violation of this article or of a wastewater
discharge permit, the Director may require a user to develop a compliance
schedule for installation of control technology.
D.    Compliance with Regulations of Public Agencies.
   Any condition that violates any state, federal, or local statute, rule,
regulation or ordinance (including, without limitation, any EPA regulation)
regulating industrial pretreatment is prohibited.
E.   Storage of Hazardous/Dangerous Materials.
   (1)   The storage of any material in areas served by public sewers or in
areas draining into the City's sewer which, because of discharge or leakage
from such storage, may create an explosion hazard in the POTW or in any other
way have a deleterious effect upon the POTW or the treatment processes or
constitute a hazard to human, animal, or plant life or the receiving stream
shall be subject to review by the Director, who may, at his discretion, require
reasonable safeguards to prevent discharge or leakage of such materials into
the sewers.
   (2)   No hazardous or dangerous materials, including, but not limited to,
paints, solvents, boiler treatment chemicals, sludges, and hazardous wastes (as
defined by 40 CFR 261.3) shall be stored in proximity to a floor drain or other
sewer access.  Containers of such materials shall be clearly labeled and stored
in a place where the materials, in case of leakage or rupture of the container,
cannot enter the POTW.
   (3)   Where containers of treatment chemicals which are manually or
automatically pumped into a system must be maintained in proximity of a floor
drain, a physical containment shall be installed that is adequate to contain at
least 120% of the maximum volume of the container.
   (4)   Any facility, including manufacturing, warehousing, distribution,
commercial, private, and retail facilities having underground storage of
materials shall, upon request by the Director, provide documentation the

(Ord. No. 3216, § 2, 5-22-03; Ord. No. 4250, § 3, 2-13-20)
Sec. 106-153.  Direct discharges prohibited.
A.   Discharge Into Waters of the State
   (1)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any prohibited or
specifically limited pollutant into any storm sewer, drain, gutter, stream, or
natural or manmade outlet or in any way waters of the state unless such
discharge has been specifically reviewed and approved by the appropriate state
and/or federal agency.
   (2)   Documentation of approval for direct discharges shall be filed with
the Director.
B.   Discharges Onto Public or Private Property
   (1)   No person shall deposit or discharge any wastewater, industrial waste,
or polluted liquid onto public or private property or street that is adjacent
to any natural outlet, natural watercourse, storm sewer, gutter, drainage
ditch, or other area within the jurisdiction of the City of Longview, Texas.
   (2)   Pollution of water of the states caused by runoff or washing, whether
accidental or intentional, is strictly prohibited.
C.   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards
    T he Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N. Parts 405-471, as currently or subsequently promulgated, are
hereby incorporated.  Users must comply with the Categorical Pretreatment
Standards.  When wastewater subject to a Pretreatment Standard, is mixed with
wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the Director shall impose an
alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
D.   Modification of Categorical Pretreatment Standards
     Where the city’s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal
of pollutants limited by Categorical Pretreatment Standards, the city may apply
to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the
pretreatment standards.  “Consistent removal” shall mean reduction in the
amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent
which is achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken when measured
according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 403.7(c)(2) - “General
Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution” promulgated
pursuant to the Act.  The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits
contained in 40 CFR Part 403.
E.   Specific Pollutant Limitations:  Local Limits 
   No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the pollutant
limits below.  These limits are based on either flow proportional or time
proportional composite samples.
      Element               Limit (Daily Max.)
      Aluminum               10.00 mg/l
      Arsenic                  0.18 mg/l
      Barium                  4.00 mg/l
      Cadmium               0.11 mg/l
      Chromium (total)            3.00mg/l
      Copper                  1.94 mg/l
      Cyanide (total)               0.0005mg/l
      Lead                  0.85 mg/l
      Manganese               5.00 mg/l
      *Mercury               0.00 mg/l
      Molybdenum               0.59 mg/l
      Nickel                  0.50 mg/l
      Selenium               0.084 mg/l
      Silver                  0.088 mg/l
      Zinc                  4.00 mg/l
      Oils and Grease (HEM)            100.0 mg/l
      * Compliance will be determined at the minimal analytical level.
    The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to
the POTW.  All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal
unless indicated otherwise.  The City may impose mass limitations in addition
to the concentration-based limitations above.
F.   State Requirements. 
   State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations and
those in this article.
G.   City’s Right of Revision.
   The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent
limitations or requirements on wastewater discharges if deemed necessary to
comply with the objectives presented in subsection (a) of Section 106-151 of
this Article V.
   Any person who wishes to increase his flow, concentration, or mass of
pollutants above the limits stated in his Wastewater Discharge Permit must
obtain an amended permit from the Director.
H.   Prohibition of Dilution
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national
categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed by the City or State.
I.   Slug Control Plans
   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this article shall not
be processed or stored in a manner, which could result in a discharge of such
pollutants, substances, or wastewater to the POTW. To prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials, facilities shall be provided and maintained
at the owner or user’s cost and expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Director for review, and shall be approved by the Director before construction
of the facility.  The Director shall evaluate, within one year of a User being
designated a Significant Industrial User, whether each such Significant
Industrial User needs a plan or other action to control slug discharges.  The
Slug Control Plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
   (1)   a description of discharge practices including non-routine batch
discharges;
   (2)   a description of stored chemicals;
   (3)   procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of contaminant structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and measures and equipment for emergency
response; and
   (4)   procedures for immediate notification of the facility’s Authorized
Representative and the Director in the event of a slug discharge, including any
dishcarge that would violate a prhibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with
procedures for follow-up notification within five days.
      a.   These procedures shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the
workplace.
      b.   Employers shall ensure all employees who may cause such a discharge
to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedures.
   (5)   Slug Discharge is defined as any discharge of a non-routine, episodic
nature, including but not limited to accidental spill or a non-customary batch
discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause interference or pass
through, or in any other way violate the Control Authority's regulations, Local
Limits or permit conditions. 
   No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of
this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
the Director has approved accidental discharge procedures.  Review and approval
of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this Article V. 
J.   Procedures in Case of Slug discharge.
   (1)   In the case of a slug discharge, it is the responsibility of the user
to immediately telephone and notify the Industrial Pretreatment Division of the
incident.  The notification shall include:
      a.   name and address of the facility;
      b.   name of person responsible for operation of the facility (a contact
person for the control authority);
      c.   location of discharge;
      d.   time the discharge began and duration of the discharge;
      e.   type of waste being discharged;
      f.   cause of the discharge;
      g.   concentration and volume of the waste;
      h.   corrective actions taken; and
      i.   whether or not the discharge has been discontinued.
   (2)   Within five days following a slug discharge, the User shall submit to
the Industrial Pretreatment Division a detailed written report describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences.
   (3)   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, or
damage or other liability, which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property.
   (4)   Nor shall such notification relieve the user of fines, civil
penalties, or other liability, which may be imposed by this article or other
applicable law.

Sec. 106-154.  Fees.
   All fees shall be reviewed annually and may be changed by resolution of the
City Council.
A.   Purpose
   One purpose of this article is to provide for the recovery of cost from
users of the POTW for the implementation of the program established herein.
B.   Schedule of fees.
   The fees will consist of three basic charges.  These include a permit fee
required of all industrial users, a sampling fee to be levied at the time of
sampling, and an analysis fee to cover the cost of sample analysis. Fees shall
be set by Resolution of the City Council.
C.   Surcharges for pollutant measurements outside allowable values.
   (1)   Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Twenty-five dollars for each day in
excess of 2,000 mg/l (or permitted limit, if different) plus $.03/1,000 gallons
for each 100 mg/l in excess of 2,000 mg/l (or permitted limit, if different).
   (2)   Oil and Grease.  These fees shall be set by Resolution of the City
Council.
   (3)   pH.  These fees shall be set by resolution of the City Council.

Council.
   (5)   Temperature.  These fees shall be set by resolution of the City
Council.
   (6)   Biochemical Oxygen Demand.  These fees shall be set by resolution of
the City Council.
   (7)   Total Suspended Solids.  These fees shall be set by resolution of the
City Council.
   The daily lump sum surcharges for parameters listed above shall be applied
to days on which the parameter is found out of compliance by sampling/
monitoring performed by the city (or by self-reporting data if applicable)
until the date the facility is found to be back in compliance.
D.   Charges for Delivery of Waste to the POTW.
   (1)   An appropriate charge shall be made for each load of transported waste
delivered to the POTW treatment plant.  This charge shall be based on a per-
gallon cost of treatment for such waste and may be adjusted on an as-needed
basis to reflect changes in the cost to treat such waste.  The Director of
Public Works shall have the authority to set the charges described in this
subsection of this section in accordance with the requirements of said section.
   (2)   Prompt payment of delivery charges shall be made by the permitted.  No
permitted shall be allowed to discharge wastes to the POTW treatment plant
while delinquent in payment of charges.
   (3)   Trip tickets will be required for each hauled load.  The Industrial
Pretreatment Division will supply these forms to haulers for a fee which is set
by resolution of the City Council.  These tickets must be filled out completely
and accurately or the hauler will not be allowed to discharge the load.  False
statements on trip tickets will result in the suspension of wastewater
discharge permits and shall be subject to the penalties provided in this
article for violation hereof.
   (4)   All haulers will be issued a transported wastewater discharge permit
(Type T) for each truck used to haul liquid wastes.  An annual fee set by
resolution of City Council will be charged for each wastewater discharge
permit.
   (5)   If discharge area is left unkempt after a discharge, a clean up fee
will be assessed.  Fees shall be set by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. No. 3216, § 2, 5-22-03; Ord. No. 4250, § 3, 2-13-20)
Sec. 106-155.  Administration.
A.   Wastewater Analysis
   When requested by the Director, a User must submit inofrmation on the nature
and characteristics of its wastewater within thirty (30) days of the request. 
The Director is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may
periodically require Uders to update this information.
B.   Wastewater Discharge Permits
   1.   No Sidnificant Industrial User or waste hauler shall discharge
wastewater into the POTW wihtour first obtaining an individual wastewater
discharge permit from the Director, except that a significant industrial user
that has filed a timely application pursuant to Subsection C of this section
may continue to dishcarge for the time period specified therein
   2.   The Director may require other Users to obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Article V.
   3.   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual wastewater
dishcarge permit shall be deemed a violation of this Article V and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in Section 106-158 of
this Article V.  Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit does not
relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or with any other requirements of
Federal, State and local law.
C.   Existing Connections
   Any User required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who
was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this
Article V and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall
within thirty (30) days after being notified of the need to obtain a permit,
apply to the Director for an individual wastewater dishcarge permit in
accordance with Subsection G of this section, and shall not cause or allow
dishcarges to the POTW to continue after ninety (90) days of being notified of
the need to obtain a permit except in accordance with a wastewater discharge
permit issued by the Director.  If necessary to protect the POTW or the
environment, the Director may terminate the existing user's connection, using
the powers granted under Section 106-158, until a wastewater discharge permit
is issued.
D.   Deny/Condition New or Increase Contributions
   The Director may deny or condition new or increased contributions of
pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the POTW by industrial
users where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate
its TPDES permit.
E.   Classifications of Wastewater Discharge Permits
   1.   The Director shall be authorized to issue two specific classifications
of wastewater discharge permits, classified according to the disposal method or
type, quality, or quantity of wastewater to be discharged to the POTW:
      a.   CLASS S (significant wastewater discharge permit) shall be issued to
all users who meet the criteria for significant industrial user as outlined in
40 CFR 403.3(v) and as defined in subsection B (4448) of Section 106-151 of
this article.  All categorical users shall be issued a class S permit.
      b.   CLASS NS (nonsignificant wastewater discharge user) may be issued to
any non-domestic user of the POTW who does not meet the criteria for
significant industrial user but the Director has reason to believe should have
a control document.  The Director shall be authorized to issue five types of
the Class NS permit:
         1.   TYPE M (minor wastewater discharge permit) may be issued to non-
domestic users of the POTW who contribute less than 25,000 gallons of process
wastewater per day and who do not otherwise meet the criteria of the Class S
permit but, in the opinion of the Director, should be regulated for quality,
quantity, or type of wastewater discharge.
         2.   TYPE C (commercial wastewater discharge permit) may be issued
primarily to establishments engaged in the retail sale of prepared food and
drinks for on-premises or immediate consumption including, but not limited to,
carry-out, delivery, catering, and institutional food services, as well as any
firm, hospital, nursing home, or other person or entity whose wastewater
discharges require pretreatment in the form of a grease or sand trap.
         3.   TYPE I (intermittent wastewater discharge permit) may be issued
to users who normally do not contribute wastewater to the POTW because of
closed-loop treatment systems, but may occasionally wish to discharge
wastewater to the POTW when the treated water can not be recycled. 
Requirements for at least 24-hour advance notice of discharge shall be included
in all Type I permits.
         4.   TYPE T (transported wastewater discharge permit) shall be issued
to all users who deliver wastes, septic tank or portable toilet waste or grease
trap waste, to the POTW by truck.
         5.   TYPE N (no discharge permit) may be issued to facilities who do
not discharge process wastewater to the POTW, but would be categorical users if
process wastewater was discharged.
F.   Transported Wastewater Requirements
   1.   Loads will only be accepted during hours specified by the Industrial
Pretreatment Division.
   2.   All haulers must sign in at the Industrial Pretreatment Division office
before dumping.
   3.   Tests, which may be conducted on samples collected from trucks, include
oil and grease, pH and metals.  These tests will be paid for by the hauler and
will continue until a base line for treatment of these wastes can be
established.
   4.   Each hauler will be required to be permitted by the TCEQ.
   5.   Transported wastewater discharge permits must be available in the
vehicle at all times for inspection by staff from the Industrial Pretreatment
Division.
   6.   The Industrial Pretreatment Division will verify that each hauler is
properly permitted before being allowed to discharge their load.
   7.   No industrial wastes will be accepted unless the Industrial
Pretreatment Supervisor has granted prior approval.
G.   Permit Application
   Users required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit must
submit a permit application.  The Director may require users to submit all or

or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete.  I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment
for knowing violations.”
K.   Permit Modifications
   (1)   Within nine (9) months of the promulgation of a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, the wastewater discharge permit of users subject to such
standards shall be revised to require compliance with such standard within the
time frame prescribed by such standard.  Where a user, subject to Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted an application for a
wastewater discharge permit as required by Section 106-155, the user shall
apply for a wastewater discharge permit within 180 days after the promulgation
of the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard.  In addition, the user
with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the Industrial
Pretreatment Division within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable
Categorical Pretreatment Standard the information required by Section 106-155.
   (2)   A wastewater discharge permit may be modified for good cause at any
time during the life of the wastewater discharge permit by the Director.
      a.   Modification of the wastewater discharge permit may be made for

calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the Director;
      f.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Parts 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR
Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant
in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling
or analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the
administrator;
      g.   The Director may allow the submission of a baseline report which
utilizes only historical data, so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;

to meet the applicable pretreatment standard, a plan outlining the shortest
schedule by which such additional pretreatment or O & M will be provided shall
be included.  The completion date of this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
      a.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events (including, but not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation) leading to the
construction and operation of the additional pretreatment facilities required
to meet the applicable pretreatment standard. No increment shall exceed nine
(9) months.
      b.   No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final compliance date, a progress report shall be submitted to the Director
including, a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment in the
schedule and, if not, the reason for the delay, the date compliance with the
increment is expected, and the steps being taken to return the construction to
the schedule established.  In no instance shall more than nine months elapse
between progress reports to the Director.
      c.   The compliance schedule shall be signed and certified by the
authorized representative in accordance with Subsection H of Section 106-155.
B.   Ninety-day compliance report.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Industrial Pretreatment Division a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and Requirements and the average
and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are
limited by such Pretreatment Standards or requirements.  The report shall state
whether the applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements are being met on
a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operations and maintenance and/
or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements.  Where a required BMP or
pollution prevention alternative is part of the Categorical Standard, the User
must submit documentation to demonstrate compliance with the BMP or pollution
prevention alternative.  This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user, and certified by a registered
professional engineer.
C.   Periodic compliance reports. 
   1.   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard or requirement, after the
compliance date of such pretreatment standard or requirement, or, in the case
of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall
submit to the Industrial Pretreatment Division during the months of May and
November, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement or by the Director, a report indicating the nature concentration of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for
the reporting period..  The May report shall include all laboratory analyses
from November through April, and the November report shall include all
laboratory analyses from May through October.  The reports shall also include
documentation of the chain of custody for each laboratory analysis.
Documentation of the chain of custody must be in a form acceptable to the
Director and in compliance with any applicable state or federal regulations. 
In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows, which
during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in
subsection (k) of Section 106-155.  For Categorical Industrial Users that have
a required BMP or pollution prevention alternative as part of the Categorical
Standard, documentation to demonstrate compliance must also be submitted
according to the guidelines listed above.  Noncategorical Significant
Industrial Users are required to report data obtained through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report which
data are representative of conditions occuring during the reporting period.  At
the discretion of the Director and in consideration of such factors as local
high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Director may agree
to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
   2.   The Director may impose mass limitations on users where the impositions
of mass limitations are appropriate.  In such cases, the report required by
subsection (a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated
by pretreatment standards or requirements in the effluent of the user.  These
reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge,
including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass
where requested by the Director of Public Works, of pollutants contained
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.  The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the
applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement.
   3.   All analyses, monitoring, and tests required under this Article V shall
be performed in accordance with procedures established by the approval
authority pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR Part
136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
approval authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the approval authority.
   4.   If a User subject to a reporting requirement in this section monitors
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently
that required by Director, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report.   
D.   Compliance schedules
   The Director will require:
   1.   The development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for
the installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements; and
   2.   The submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports including
documentation showing compliance with required BMP's or pollution prevention
alternatives from industrial users as are necessary to assess and assure
compliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements,
including but not limited to the reports required in 40 CFR 403.12. If
additional pretreatment and/or operation and will be required to meet the
pretreatment standards; the compliance schedule, the shortest schedule by which
the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or operation
and maintenance, will be required.  The completion date in this schedule shall
not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard.  (40 CFR 403.12 (b)(7)).
   The conditions in 40 CFR 403.12 (c) (1-3) shall apply to the compliance
schedule.
E.   Noncompliance Notification
   1.   If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must
notify the Control Authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation.  The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit
the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority within thirty (30)
days after becoming aware of the violation.  Resampling by the Industrial User
is not required if the Control Authority performs sampling at the User's
facility at least once a month, or if the Control Authority performs sampling
at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the
time when the User or the Control Authority receives the results of this
sampling, or if the Control Authority has performed the sampling and analysis
in lieu of the Industrial User.
   2.   Where the Control Authority has performed the sampling and analysis in
lieu of the Industrial User, the Control Authority must perform the repeat
sampling and analysis unless it notifies the Industrial User of the violation
and requires the Industrial User to perform the repeat sampling and
analysis.   
F.   Notice of Potential Problems, Including Slug Discharge
   In a case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, or a Slug Discharge that may cause potential problems for the POTW:
   1.   A user shall immediately notify Director by telephone of the incident. 
This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and the corrective actions taken by the
User.
   2.   A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the
time the user becomes aware such discharge.  The written submission shall
contain a description of the discharge and its cause; the duration of the
discharge, including exact dates and times, and, if the discharge has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and the steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the discharge. 
The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   3.    All Users shall permanently post on a bulletin board or other
prominent location a notice advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in this provision.  Users shall ensure that all employees,
who could cause such a discharge, to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
G.   Notice of Changed Discharge
   Each User must notify the Director of any significant changes to the User's
operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its
wastewater at least ten (10) days before the change.
   1.   The Director may require the User to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of
a wastewater discharge permit application.
   2.   The Director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or
modigy an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed
conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
H.   Hazardous Waste Notification
   1.   Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261.  Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type
of discharge (continuouse, batch, or other).  If the User discharges more than
one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the User:  an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, and estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream exprected to be discharged during the following twelve (12)
months.  All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the discharge commences.  Any notification under this
paragraph need be sumitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. 
However, notifications of changed conditions must be sumitted under Subsection
G of this provision.  The notification requirement in this Section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to categorical
Pretreatment Standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Article V.
   2.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph 1, above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fiftee (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).  Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification.  Subsequent months during which the User
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   3.   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 or RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must notify the Director,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of
the effective date of such regulations.
   4.   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the User shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
   5.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Ordinance, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
I.   Analytical Requirements
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment
Standard.  If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the
Part 136 sampling an analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant
in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Director or other parties approved by
EPA.
J.   Sample Collection
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   1.   Except as indicated in Section 2 and 3, below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using 24 hour flow proportional composite sampling
techniques.  Unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling  is
authorized by the Director.  Where time proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be representative of
the discharge.  Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows:  for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oils
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.  Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Director, as appropriate. 
In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous
Limits.
   2.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   3.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in this section a minimum of four (4) grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and
volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do
not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, (the
Superintendent) may authorize a lower minimum.  For the periodic compliance
reports required by this section, the Industrial User is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with
applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
K.   Record Keeping
   1   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Article V shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
Article V and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under
Section 106-153.F..  Records shall include:
      a   the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of
the person(s) taking the samples;
      b   the dates analyses were performed;
      c   who performed the analyses;
      d   the analytical techniques or methods used; and
      e   the results of such analyses. 
   These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3)
years.  This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the City of Longview, or where the Director
has specifically notified the user of a longer retention period.
(Ord. No. 4250, § 3, 2-13-20)
Sec. 106-156.1.  Monitoring facilities.
   The Director of Public Works may require the user, at the user’s expense, to
provide and operate, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and
flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems.  The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
Director of Public Works may, when such a location would be impractical or
cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.  The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.
(Ord. No. 3216, § 2, 5-22-03; Ord. No. 4250, § 3, 2-13-20)
Sec. 106-156.2.  Traps.
   Where necessary to prevent the discharge of grease, oil, flammable
substances, sand, or other harmful wastes into the POTW, a user shall provide
at his own expense a trap to intercept these substances.  Traps shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwellings.
   Traps shall be required for all schools, restaurants, cafeterias, car
washes, automotive services (including service stations), hospitals, nursing
homes, and other commercial establishments for which, in the opinion of the
City’s Industrial pretreatment supervisor, a trap is necessary for protection
of the POTW.  The owner or operator of an establishment shall have the right to
appeal the Industrial pretreatment supervisor’s decision to the Director of
Public Works.
   Each trap in active use shall be cleaned at least one (1) time every 90 days
(unless the Industrial pretreatment supervisor specifies differently). 
Cleaning more frequently than 90 days may be required by the City’s Industrial
pretreatment supervisor.  Cleaning schedules varying from the 90-day minimum
shall be issued to the affected establishment in writing.  The user shall
maintain on the premises written verification of the date when each trap is
cleaned, with the location and identity of the trap clearly defined.  Unless
otherwise allowed by the city, the commercial firm performing the cleaning
shall provide such verification.  Such verifications shall be kept available to
the city for a minimum of three (3) years.  The requirements of the plumbing
ordinance of the city, where applicable, shall govern the installation and
maintenance of traps.
   Establishments existing prior to the time this amendment is adopted which do
not have the required trap(s) installed or whose trap(s) does not currently
meet city standards will have 180 calendar days after passage of this amendment
to install the required trap(s), or bring their existing trap to standard.
(Ord. No. 3216, § 2, 5-22-03; Ord. No. 4250, § 3, 2-13-20)
Sec. 106-156.3.  Right of entry:  inspection and sampling.
The Director shall inspect and sample the facilities of any user at least once
per year to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all
requirements are being complied with.  Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Director or the city’s
representatives ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying or the performance of any of the Director’s duties.  Any requests or
demands made by the Director or the city’s representatives shall be acted upon
in a timely manner.  The city, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on
the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.  Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into the user’s premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with the user’s security guards so that upon presentation of
suitable identification, personnel from the city, state, and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and
easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall
not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the user’s premises
shall be a violation of this article.  The Director may obtain a search warrant
from the municipal court in an instance where the user does not provide access
to its premises.
(Ord. No. 3216, § 2, 5-22-03; Ord. No. 4250, § 3, 2-13-20)
Sec. 106-156.4.  Pretreatment.
   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply
with all Pretreatment Standards, including without limitation, this Article V
and all Categorical Pretreatment Standards.  Each user shall achieve compliance
with all Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Director shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user’s expense.  Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operation procedures shall be submitted to the
Director for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director before
construction of the facility.  The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Director
prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.
   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards or
requirements shall be made available to officials of the City of Longview, the
EPA or the state upon request and shall be retained by the user for a minimum
of three years or until any ongoing litigation involving the pretreating user,
and related to compliance with this article, has been resolved.

A.   Upset Provision
   In an action brought in federal court only:
   1.   For the purpose of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with Categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
User.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operation error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
of paragraph (3) of this subsection are met.
   3.   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that;
         i)   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         ii)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         iii)   The User has submitted the following information to the
Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset; and if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five (5) days:
            a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            c)   Ssteps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   5.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   6.   User shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement applies in the
situation where among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
B.   Act of God Defense
   In an action brought in municipal or state court only:
   1.   If a person can establish that an event would otherwise be a violation
of, this article or a permit issued under this article was caused solely by an
act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe, as defined in Texas Water
Code Section 7.251, the event is not a violation.
   2.   Of this article or the permit.  In an enforcement proceeding, the user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot or
other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof.  In the event that an act of
God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe has been established the user
shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such
time as the reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility is resotred
or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
   3.   Burden of Proof.  In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to
establish the Act of God affirmative defense shall have the burden of proving
by a preponderance of the evidence that an event that would otherwise be a
violation of the ordinance or permit issued under the ordinance, was solely by
the act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe.
C.   Bypass
   1.    For the purpose of this section,
      a.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastewater from any
portion of a User’s treatment facility.
      b.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities, which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources, which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   2.   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are not subject to
the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection.
   3.   Notice
      a.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Director at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      b.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the
bypass.  The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass.  The Director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24)
hours.
   4.    Bypass
      a.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life or personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         3.   The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of
this section.
      b.   The Director may approve an authorized bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in paragraph (4)(a) of this section.

   In accordance with Texas Local Government Code Section 54.001 and Section 1-
4 of the Code of Ordinances, City of Longview, Texas, any person who fails to
comply with the provisions of this Article V. commits an offense punishable by
a fine of up to the maximum allowed by State law.  Each day on which a

(d) Cleaning Schedules
1)  Grease traps and grease interceptors shall be cleaned as often as necessary
to ensure that sediment and floating materials do not accumulate to impair the
efficiency of the grease trap/interceptor; to ensure the discharge is in
compliance with local discharge limits; and to ensure no visible grease is
observed in discharge.
2)  Grease traps and grease inerceptors subject to these standards shall be
completely evacuated a minimum of every ninety (90) days, or more frequently
when:

   (g)  name and signature of facility on-site representative acknowledging
receipt of the waste and the amount of waste received;
   (h)  the volume of the grease waste received; and
   (i)  a consecutive numerical tracking number to assist transporters, waste
generators, and regulating authorities in tracking the volume of grease
transported.
3)  Manifests shall be divided into five parts and records shall be maintained
as follows:
   (a)  One part of the manifest shall have the generator and transporter
information completed and be given to the generator at the time of  waste

person who generated the wastes within fifteen (15) days after the waste is
received at the disposal or processing facility.
   (f)  One part of the manifest shall go to the Control Authority within
thirty (30) days of the collection event.
4)  Copies of the manifests returned to the waste generator shall be retained
for five (5) years and be readily available for review by the Control
Authority.
(f)  Alternative Treatment
1)  A person commits an offense if the person introduces, or causes, permits,
or suffers the introduction of any surfactant, solvent or emulsifier into a
grease trap.  Surfactants, solvents, and emulsifiers are materials which allow
the grease to pass from the trap into the collection system, and include but
are not limited to enzymes, soap, diesel, kerosene, terpene, and other
solvents.
2)  It is affirmative defense to an enforcement of Section III (f) (1) that the
use of surfactants or soaps is incidental to normal kitchen hygiene operations.
3)  Bioremediation media may be used with the Control Authority's approval if
the person has proved to the satisfaction of the POTW that laboratory testing
which is appropriate for the type  of grease trap to be used has verified that:
   (a)  The media is a pure live bacterial product which is not inactivated by
the use of domestic or commercial disinfectants and detergents, strong alkalis,
acids, and/or water temperatures of 160/F (71/C).
   (b)  The use of media does not reduce the buoyancy of the grease layer in
the grease trap and does not increase the potential for oil and grease to be
discharged to the sanitary sewer.
   (c)  The use of the bioremediation media does not cause foaming in the
sanitary sewer.
   (d)  The BOD, COD, and TSS discharged to the sanitary sewer after use of the
media does not exceed the BOD, COD, and TSS which would be discharged if the
product were not being used and the grease trap was being properly maintained. 
pH levels must be between 6 and 11.
4)  All testing designed to satisfy the criteria set forth in Section III (f)
(3) shall be scientifically sound and statistically valid.  All tests to
determine oil and grease, TSS, BOD, COD, pH, and other pollutant levels shall
use appropriate tests which have been approved by the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and which are defined
in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136 or Title 30, TEXAS
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE § 319.11.  Testing shall be open to inspection by the City
of Lognview Industrial Pretreatment Department, and shall meet the Contorl
Authority's approval.

use not anticipated may seek to locate in the City of Longview. In order to
provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the
appropriate classification of any new or unlisted use shall be made as follows:
   A.   The new or unlisted use will be referred to the Director of Planning
who will make a determination as to the appropriate classification of the new
or unlisted use based on findings of fact in relation to the nature of the use
and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing, type of product,

employment, transportation requirements, amount of noise, odor, fumes, light,
dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be generated and the general
requirements for public utilities.

8-300   Establishment of the floodplain conservation district (FP)
   To provide for the appropriate use of land which has a history of inundation
or is determined to be subject to flood hazard, and to promote the general
welfare and provide protection from flooding, there is hereby adopted a
floodplain conservation district which shall be designated with the floodplain
prefix, "FP".
The floodplain conservation district shall include all areas subject to
inundation by floodwaters of the one hundred (100) year frequency. The
floodplain conservation district designated on the official zoning district map
of the City of Longview, shall be deemed an overlay on any zoning districts now
or hereafter applicable to any lot. Should the floodplain conservation be
declared inapplicable to any tract by reason of action of (1) the City Council
in amending these articles; or (2) any court of competent jurisdiction in
interpreting the same; or (3) any court of competent jurisdiction in
determining the legal effect of the same; the zoning applicable to such lot
shall be deemed to be the district in which it is located without consideration
of these articles.
The source of this delineation shall be the most recent Flood Hazard Boundary
Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, as the case may be, issued separately or as
part of detailed studies, by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, Flood Insurance Administration and approved by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, and the City Council and any other areas determined by
City Council. In the event maps are non-existent, then the City Council shall
designate the floodplain conservation district.
8-301   Permitted Uses and Activites
   A.   That in the floodplain conservation district, the development and/or
use of any land shall be permitted provided that the development and/or use
adheres to all the requirements of its underlying zoning district, and the City
of Longview floodplain management ordinances.
   B.   That in the designated floodway, which is the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas required to carry and discharge a flood of a given
magnitude, no modification, alteration, repair or new construction of
buildings, structures, fill or any combination of these shall be permitted
which would impair its ability to carry and discharge flood waters or increase
the water surface elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood.  An exception
may be granted if the proposed encroachment is fully offset by stream
improvements, which prevent an increase of water surface elevation of more than
one (1) foot at any point.  The designated floodway shall be that area
delineated in the most recent Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and Flood
Insurance Rate Map approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City
Council.
8-302   Special Regulations
   A.   In case of any dispute concerning the boundaries of a floodplain
conservation district, an initial determination shall be made by the zoning
officer.
   B.   Any party aggrieved by a decision of the zoning officer as to the
boundaries of the floodplain conservation district as defined in Article 8-300,
which may include the grounds that the said data referred to therein, is or has
become incorrect because of changes due to natural or other causes, may appeal
to the City Council.  The burden of proof in such an appeal shall be on the
appellant.
8-303   Municipal Liability
   The grant of a zoning permit or approval of a subdivision plat in the
Floodplain Conservation District shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee or warranty of any kind by the City of Longview, Texas, or by any
official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed
use, and shall create no liability upon the City of Longview, Texas, its
officials or employees.
8-400   Specific Use Permits
   The City Council of the City of Longview, Texas, after public hearing and
proper notice to all parties affected and after recommendations by the city
Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize the issuance of specific use
permits for the uses indicated by "S" in the use schedule, 8-101-8-113. 
Generally, the duration of such a specific use permit shall be indefinite. 
However, where the definition or explanation of a use, as found in Section 8-
600 of this zoning ordinance, specifies a limited duration for a specific use
permit for a specified use, any specific use permit issued for said specified
use shall expire and become null and void upon the expiration of the specified
duration.  Additionally, the City Council may specify a limited duration for
any specific use permit, and any specific use permit for which such a duration
is so specified shall expire and become null and void upon the expiration of
the specified duration.  Upon the expiration of a specific use permit, the
applicant may apply and may be approved for another specific use permit;
provided, however, that any such specific use permit must comply with any and
all zoning and other laws applicable at the time of the new application.
(Ordinance No. 3161)
8-401   The Planning and Zoning Commission in considering and determining its
recommendations to the City Council on any request for a specific use permit
may require from the applicant plans, information, operating data and expert
evaluation concerning the location and function and characteristics of any
building or use proposed.  The City Council may, in the interest of public
welfare and to assure compliance of this ordinance, establish conditions of
operation, location, arrangement and construction of any use for which a permit
is authorized.  In authorizing the location of any of the uses listed as
specific use permits, the City Council may impose such development standards
and safeguards as the conditions and locations indicate important to the
welfare and protection of adjacent property from excessive noise, vibration,
dust, smoke, fumes, gas, odor, explosion, glare, offensive view or other
undesirable or hazardous conditions. (Ordinance No. 3161)
8-500   PD-Planned Development District Uses Permitted

8-502   In establishing a planned development district in accordance with this
section, the City Council shall require a comprehensive site plan of the
development. Such site plan shall be approved and filed as part of the
ordinance prior to the issuance of any building permit in a planned development
district.  Such required plan and ordinance shall set forth the requirements
for ingress and egress to the property, public or private streets or drives,
with adequate right-of-way to conform to the thoroughfare plan of the City of
Longview, sidewalks, utilities, drainage, parking space, height of buildings,
maximum lot coverage, yards and open spaces, screening walls or fences and
other development and protective requirements considered necessary to create a
reasonable transition to and protection of the adjacent property.
8-503   Every planned development district approved under the provisions of
this ordinance shall be considered as an amendment to the ordinance as
applicable to the property involved.  In approving the planned development
district, the City Council may impose conditions relative to the standard of
development and such conditions shall be complied with before a certificate of
occupancy is issued for the use of the land, or any structure which is part of
the planned development district and such conditions shall not be construed as
conditions precedent to the approval of the zoning amendment, but shall be
construed as conditions precedent to the granting of a certificate of
occupancy.
8-504   In instances where property is adjacent to an existing planned
development district, minimum acreage requirements may not need to be met if
the following conditions are satisfied: (Ordinance No. 2007)

same as the adjacent existing PDD.
   B.    The adjacent, existing planned development district (PDD) has in
excess of seventy-five (75) percent of the major structural development
completed.
   C.   Land area of the proposed planned development district is greater than
50% of the normally required minimum acreage.
   D.   The regulations applicable to and allowed uses of the proposed planned
development district are substantially identical to those of the existing
planned development.
   E.   The proposed use(s) is no more intensive than that of the adjacent
planned development.  For purposes of this subsection, measures of
intensiveness shall  include size and lot coverage of structures, traffic
generating capabilities, hours of  operation, type of service or product sold
or manufactured, process of sale or manufacturing, number of employees, and
other similar factors.
   F.   The adjacent, existing planned development must have been established
under minimum acreage requirements required by the ordinance effective at the
time of establishment.
For purposes of this Section 8-504 only, "adjacent" shall be interpreted to
include lots separated by a street or alley.
8-505   Infill Planned Development (Ordinance No. 2268)
   A.   Purpose:
      The objective of the infill planned development (PD) is to encourage
redevelopment within areas of the city that are experiencing significant
economic disinvestments and/or residential deterioration.
   B.   Criteria:
      Land to be zoned as an infill PD must satisfy the following criteria:
      1.   be located in the area generally described as being bounded by
Marshall Avenue to the north; Spur 63, Grace Creek and Ray Street to the west;
FM 1845, city limit along the railroad tracks and Interstate 20 to the south;
and Eastman Road to the east.  Lots having frontage on Marshall Avenue and
Eastman Road that are adjacent to the established boundary are also eligible. 
This area is more clearly defined by the map found in Subsection 8-505 (d);
and,
      2.   is unlikely to be developed or utilized under the existing zoning
due to changes in land use and development patterns; and,
      3.   such development is not contrary to any planned or ongoing
redevelopment efforts in the area; and,
      4.   such development will not have a substantial adverse impact on
surrounding uses and will not unreasonably impair the continuation of existing
adjacent uses.

applicant seeking the infill PD designation.
   C.   Requirements:
      1.   New development may be permitted to have less than minimum lot size,
lot depth and width, maximum building coverage, minimum floor area, and
setbacks when needed to develop a lot.  In addition, some flexibility may be
afforded to minimum parking requirements; however, careful consideration must
be given to public safety.  Deviations below the minimum requirements listed
above may be given only if such deviations are proven necessary to enable the
development of the lot.  In some cases, building codes will determine minimum
setbacks from property lines and such requirements must be met.
      2.   The infill PD shall clearly denote what uses are permitted.
      3.   No outdoor storage shall be permitted in an infill PD that is in or
adjacent to a residential area.
      4.   Non-residential uses which may emit noise, odors, dust, or other
particles beyond the lot lines shall not be permitted in or adjacent to a
residential area.
      5.   An infill PD must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
development and the required off-street parking; no other minimum acreage
requirement shall apply.
      6.   Upon a proper showing of suitability of use by the applicant, the
infill PD is eligible and can be approved for all uses except industrial uses.
      7.   Appropriate measures shall be taken by the applicant, if need be, to
protect adjoining property, such as:
         a.   providing and maintaining screening;
         b.   controlling placement of lighting;
         c.   limiting noise (appropriate insulation);
         d.   controlling ingress and egress points;
         e.   limiting the hours of operation;
         f.   other provisions as deemed appropriate by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and/or the City Council, including the requirements referenced in
Section 8-503.
      8.   The burden of proof to satisfy each of these requirements will be on
the applicant seeking the infill PD designation.

9-108   Buffer Yard Requirements
   A.   Applicability
      1.   Where a side or rear lot line abuts or adjoins a lot with a less
intensive zoning designation, buffer yards are required as set forth in Table
9-108.
      2.   For uses that do not require Industrial zoning, any areas used as
buffer yards and any landscaping in said areas that otherwise complies with the
requirements of this article will be counted as landscaped areas and as
landscaping, respectively, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of
Section 9-111 of this ordinance.  For uses that require Industrial zoning, any
areas used as buffer yards and any landscaping in said areas will not be
counted as landscaped areas and as landscaping, respectively, for purposes of
satisfying the requirements of Section 9-111 of this ordinance, and the
requirements of this section shall be in addition to those of Section 9-111.
      3.   Buffer yards are not required on that portion of a lot located
immediately adjacent to another lot occupied by a lawful non-conforming
development.
      4.   The requirements of this section shall not apply to a lawful non-
conforming development.  However, except as expressly provided otherwise in
this section, an abandonment, expansion, destruction or change in use of a
lawful non-conforming development shall cause the lawful non-conforming
development to lose its status as a lawful non-conforming development and said
development shall thereafter be subject to the requirements of this section. 
For purposes of this section, "destruction" of a lawful non-conforming
development means damage by fire, explosion, flood, tornado, or similar
catastrophic event where the cost of repair exceeds fifty (50) percent of the
reasonable value of the lawful non-conforming development as the lawful non-
conforming development existed prior to the damage.
      5.   The requirements of this section shall not apply to the
reconstruction of a lawful non-conforming development due to damage by fire,
explosion, flood, tornado, or similar catastrophic event if the damage to the
lawful non-conforming development does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the
reasonable value of the lawful non-conforming development as the lawful non-
conforming development existed prior to the damage.
      6.   This section does not apply to any lots located within the Central
Business district (CB).
      7.   This section does not apply to any lot occupied solely by a one-
family dwelling and its accessory uses (if any).
      8.   This section does not apply to any lot occupied solely by a two-
family dwelling and its accessory uses (if any).
      9.   This section does not apply to any lot on which there is no
development.
      10.   This section does not apply to expansion, reconstruction, or
renovation of an existing development if the expansion, reconstruction, or
renovation will not do any of the following:
         a.   increase the total square footage of a building and its
associated parking lot by twenty-five percent (25%) or more; or
         b.   increase the number of stories of a building and increase the
total square footage of the building by twenty-five percent (25%) or more; or
         c.   result in a more intensive use on the lot.
      11.   The requirements of this section do not apply to that portion of a
parking lot that existed before the effective date of this section.
      12.   Anything to the contrary in this section notwithstanding, this
section shall apply in each instance where a one-family dwelling or a two-
family dwelling exists in a zoning district other than SF or TF and a change in
occupancy results in a more intensive use.
      13.   Anything to the contrary in this section notwithstanding, this
section applies in each instance where a lot is rezoned from either SF or TF to
a zoning classification other than SF or TF and the lot or any portion of the
lot is converted to a use that is not allowed in either SF or TF zoning
districts.
      14.   This section does not apply to any excluded lot area, as the term
"excluded lot area" is used in Section 9-112 of this ordinance.
   B.   Buffer Yards Required
      Buffer yards shall be required in accordance with the following
regulations:
      1.   Buffer yards shall be installed on those sides and rear lot line(s)
that adjoin or abut a less intensive land use/zoning district for the entire
length of said common boundary with the less intensive use or zoning district. 
Those instances where buffer yards are required are described in Table 9-108. 
Buffer yards shall not extend into the public right-of-way.
      2.   To determine if buffer yards are required, as well as the type of
buffer yard required between adjacent or adjoining properties, the following
procedure shall be followed:
         a.   Identify the zoning of the subject lot and the zoning of each
adjacent lot,
         b.   Determine if buffer yards are required, as well as the specific
requirements (if any) for affected side or rear lot line(s), or portions
thereof, from Table 9-108.  Existing plant materials, fences and similar
features on the subject site may be counted as contributing to satisfying the
buffer yard requirement.  Required buffer yards are to be provided independent
of similar materials located on adjacent properties.
         c.   The buffer yard requirements may be satisfied by any one of the
methods depicted in Table 9-108, except that a fence shall be provided in all
instances where an I, C, GR or MF zoning district abuts a lot zoned SF or TF.
   C.   Buffer Yard Requirements
      1.   Should a developed use propose to become a more intensive use via a
rezoning request, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may,
during the review process, determine if additional buffering is needed, and if
so, the extent and type required in addition to those in Table 9-108.
      2.   The City Planner shall have the authority to reduce the buffer yard
requirement to a width no less than five (5) feet in those instances where an
adjoining lot is located in a floodplain that prevents and/or severely limits
development of said lot.
      3.   The applicability of buffer yard requirements for unlisted uses, or
for a new development located adjacent to an unlisted use, shall be determined
by the City Planner.  In those instances when a permitted non-residential land
use, such as a school, church or utility, applies for a building permit to
locate in a TF or SF zoning district, the City Planner shall observe the
general concepts depicted in Table 9-108 to form the basis for determining
applicable buffer yard requirements.  When any party is aggrieved by the
decision of the City Planner as to the classification of unlisted uses for
buffering purposes an appeal may be made to the Planning and Zoning Commission
as provided in Section 8-300 of this ordinance.
      4.   Required buffer yards shall be landscaped with grass, shrubs, or
trees, or in combination with other suitable ground cover or screening
materials (such as, but not limited to, approved fences and berms), subject to
the Landscape Plan requirements of Section 9-112.  Required buffer yards shall
remain as open space, free from all structures, except that permitted
driveways, pedestrian walkways, flagpoles and similar appurtenant structures
may be located in required buffer yards.  Off-street parking areas, dumpsters,
drive-through window driving lanes, order window speakers, or interior access
drives/maneuvering areas shall not be permitted in required buffer yards.
      5.   Wheel stops, curbs, or similar barriers shall be utilized to
prohibit parking and car overhang into required buffer yard planting areas. 
Accepted professional landscaping standards shall be utilized to ensure that
the area within vegetation drip lines is not covered with impervious materials
to a degree that would adversely affect landscaping in required buffer yards.
      6.   The use of loose stone, rock, gravel or other decorative chips and
like materials may be utilized as a landscaping accent in buffer yards, but
shall be limited to only twenty percent (20%) of the area of the required
buffer, and must be supplemented with other landscaping materials in accordance
with the requirements of this ordinance.
      7.   When a fence is required to satisfy buffer yard regulations, the
fence may be comprised of a berm, solid year-round vegetative screen, masonry
wall or wooden fencing, or a combination of these treatments, provided that a
minimum height of said opaque screen provides one hundred percent (100%) year-
round screening and has a minimum height of six (6) feet, as measured from
grade.  In the event that a solid vegetative screen is utilized, the vegetative
screen shall provide year-round screening and have a minimum height of three
(3) feet at the time of installation and a minimum height of six (6) feet at
the time of maturity.
      8.   Screening fences installed to comply with the requirements of this
section shall be constructed of conventional, opaque fencing materials to be
approved by the City Planner.  Acceptable screening fences include, but are not
limited to, solid wood fences, made of treated pine, cedar or redwood, or
masonry walls.  Unacceptable materials include, but are not limited to,
plywood, corrugated steel sheets and chain link fences with weave.  All
required fences shall be maintained in a good condition.
      9.   In the case of multi-storied buildings, an additional five (5) feet
of side and rear yard buffer depth shall be added for every story above one (1)
with a maximum buffer width not to exceed 30 feet.
      10.   Existing plant materials may be retained to satisfy the provisions
of this section, provided that natural areas proposed to be retained are
documented on submitted landscape plans and preserved at all times thereafter. 
The site development plan and landscape plan submitted for permits shall
include information detailing the measures to ensure that these natural areas
will not be affected by the development of the lot or by the use of the lot.
   D.   Compliance Required
      1.   A sufficiently detailed site plan shall be submitted in accordance
with the requirements of Section 7-200 and Section 9-112 demonstrating
compliance with the requirements of said sections.
      2.   A certificate of occupancy shall be withheld until compliance with
all applicable requirements of this section is attained.

defined as a receptacle intended for the disposal, collection or temporary
storage of unsorted solid waste products and refuse outdoors.  A refuse
collection facility includes, without limitation, trash dumpsters and trash
compactors.  The therm does not include a dumpster located on a lot with an
active building permit for the sole purpose of collecting solid waste products
and refuse that result from construction occurring on said lot during the
effective period of the active building permit.
      2.   All refuse collection facilities located in SF, TF, MF, O, NS, P,
GR, C, CB, I, and PD zoning districts, shall be screened from view of public
streets and adjoining properties in accordance with the regulations contained
in this section.
      3.   This section shall apply to each and every refuse collection
facility without regard to whether the refuse collection facility existed at
its present location prior to the effective date of this section.
      4.   Anything to the contrary in this section notwithstanding, this
section shall apply in each instance where a one-family dwelling or a two-
family dwelling exists in a zoning district other than SF or TF and a change in
occupancy results in a more intensive unit.
      5.   Anything to the contrary in this section notwithstanding, this
section applies in each instance where a lot is rezoned from either SF or TF to
a zoning classification other than SF or TF and the lot or any portion of the
lot is converted to a use that is not allowed in either SF or TF zoning
districts.
   B.   Screening/Orientation Requirements
      1.   Each refuse collection facility shall be screened with opaque
screening such that the refuse collection facility is not visible from the
public right-of-way and is not visible from any adjacent area that is zoned SF,
TF, or MF pursuant to this ordinance.  All screening used to comply with the
requirements of this section shall have a height equal to or greater than the
height of the refuse collection facility screened and shall otherwise comply
with this section.
      2.   Screening fences installed to comply with the requirements of this
section shall be constructed of conventional, opaque fencing materials to be
approved by the City Planner.  Acceptable screening fences include, but are not
limited to, solid wood fences, made of treated pine, cedar or redwood, or
masonry walls.  Unacceptable materials include, but are not limited to,
plywood, corrugated steel sheets and chain link fences with weave.  All
required fences shall be maintained in a good condition.
      3.   Solid vegetative screens may be utilized to screen dumpsters
provided that a minimum height of said opaque screen provides one hundred
percent (100%) year-round screening.  The vegetative screen shall have a
minimum height of three (3) feet at the time of installation and a minimum
height of six (6) feet at the time of maturity.
      4.   The City Planner may authorize the use of unconventional opaque
fencing materials to satisfy the requirements of this section if the fencing
materials so authorized match existing or proposed building facades.
      5.   Refuse collection facilities shall be located in the rear fifty
percent (50%) of the lot where practical, as determined by the City Planner in
accordance with the Appendix to this ordinance.
   C.   Compliance Required
      1.   The location of each refuse collection facility and the manner in
which each refuse collection facility is to be screened shall be clearly
delineated and described on the site plan submitted in accordance with the
requirements of Section 7-200 and the site plan shall demonstrate compliance
with this section.
      2.   A certificate of occupancy shall be withheld until compliance with
applicable requirements of this section is attained.
9-110   Screening Requirements
   A.   Screening Required
      In the zoning districts where outdoor display, storage and sales is
permitted, such outdoor display, storage, or sale of new or used goods, junk,
materials, merchandise or vehicles shall be prohibited, unless said items are

planting regulations above if such trees are in a healthy and growing condition
and are protected in compliance with all applicable provisions of this
section.  Trees counted for preservation are applied with the following ratio
(where the number immediately to the right of the colon in the table below
represents the number of required trees that may be replaced by one existing
tree of the corresponding caliper specified in the left column of the table):
 
Existing Tree Caliper Ratio (existing: required)
1" - 6"               1:1
> than 6" - 12"       1:2
> than 12"            1:3

width of nine (9) feet; and shall include at least one canopy tree or two non-
canopy trees.  The remaining area shall be landscaped with grass, groundcover
and/or shrubs, with shrubs limited to a maximum height of three (3) feet from
grade.  Landscaped area in parking islands is counted toward the total
landscaped area required for the lot.
      2.   Landscape requirements for new one-family dwellings and new two
family dwellings:
         a.   Each one-family dwelling and each two-family dwelling constructed
after the effective date of this section shall have at least one (1) tree on
the lot in order to receive a certificate of occupancy.  This can be
accomplished either through preservation of a minimum 6-caliper inch tree or
planting a tree with a minimum size of container class #10.
         b.   The exemptions set forth in Section 43-64 of the Longview City
Code do not apply to this section.
         c.   Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, a
development that is a one-family dwelling or a two-family dwelling or an
accessory use to a one-family dwelling or two-family dwelling is not required
to have an automatic sprinkler system.
         d.   Except as otherwise specified in this section, the requirements
of this subsection (2) shall constitute the only requirements of this section
applicable to a lot occupied solely by a one-family dwelling (and any
associated accessory uses) or a two-family dwelling (and any associated
accessory uses), and no requirements of this section other than those set forth
in this subsection (2) shall apply to any such lot.
      All trees required to be preserved under Article VII to Chapter 43 of the
Longview City Code must be maintained until a site plan is approved and a
building permit application has been submitted.
   C.   Landscape Planting and Criteria, Standards, and Specifications
      1.   Plant criteria
         a.   All plant materials planted to satisfy the requirements of this
section shall be of a species that will conform to the selection criteria
below:
            1.   Plant materials shall either be acceptable native plants or
plants that are known to be acclimated tot he East Texas region.  The developer
shall have the burden of proving that a plant is native to or acclimated tot eh
East Texas region.
            2.   Each plant used to satisfy the requirements of this section
shall be of a species adaptable to the specific environment and conditions in
which it will be planted; i.e., soils, water availability, height limitations,
shade and similar concerns.  The developer shall have the burden of proving
that a plant species is adaptable to the specific environment and conditions in
which it will be planted.
            3.   Artificial plants are not acceptable in satisfying any
requirement of this section.
            4.   All required landscaped areas that are not occupied by trees,
shrubs, planting beds, signs or other permitted fixtures shall be planted with
grass, sod or other suitable groundcover.  The City Planner may permit the use
of decorative gravel and like materials, provided that such surfaces do not
constitute more than thirty percent (30%) of the area used to meet the
landscaped area requirement.  Existing trees to be preserved for landscape
credit must be clearly marked as such.
         b.   Trees and shrubs planted in order to satisfy the requirements of
this section shall conform to the minimum size specified below:
            1.   Trees shall be a minimum size of container class #10 upon
planting.
            2.   Shrubs shall be a minimum size of container class #3 upon
planting.
      2.   Planting and Care Standards
         a.   Landscaping shall be installed in accordance with professional
horticultural/nursery standards and procedures to minimize stress to the
plants.  Planting of all or a portion of plant materials may be continued
during winter months, provided that plant materials are not subject to severe
freezing.  In the event that weather conditions are not suitable for planting,
with the approval of the City Planner, and prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, a bond, cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit
assigned to the City of Longview in an amount equal to the cost of all required
landscaping improvements shall be required.  The bond, cash bond or letter of
credit shall be effective for a period of time to be determined by the City
Planner, but in no event shall the City Planner require such a bond, cash bond
or letter of credit to be effective for longer than two (2) years.  After the
bond, cash bond or letter of credit has been submitted to and approved by the
City Planner, a certificate of occupancy may be issued (provided all other
applicable requirements for a certificate of occupancy have been satisfied). 
If landscaping is not fully installed and protected in compliance with the
applicable landscape plan within 180 days after the issuance of the certificate
of occupancy, the City Planner may use the bond, cash bond or letter of credit
to provide for the installation of any landscaping required for compliance with
the approved landscape plan.
         b.   The owner or the owner's contractor shall furnish, install and
protect all plant materials in accordance with the landscape plan submitted
pursuant to Section 9-112 and approved by the City Planner.
         c.   Plant materials shall be spaced so that the drip line, branches,
and root ball of any mature plant do not cause, or have the potential to cause,
damage to sewers, sidewalks, overhead utilities or other public improvements.
   D.   Landscaped Area Preservation and Maintenance During and After
Construction
      1.   Existing trees preserved in order to fulfill the requirements of
this section shall be barricaded prior to and during grading and construction
to prevent said trees from soil compaction, stacking of oil within prescribed
drip line areas, construction traffic, changes in grade and similar
construction practices that could affect existing trees.  Methods of protection
other than barricades may be employed if approved in advance by the City
Planner.  The barricades or other acceptable method of protection shall provide
an area around the protected tree having a minimum of one foot of radius for
each one (1) inch of caliper of the protected tree.
      2.   All existing undergrowth in a protected area shall remain until
construction is complete and can only be removed at that time by hand clearing.
      3.   The owner, or an agent for the owner, shall be responsible for the
continued maintenance of all landscaping, which shall be maintained in good
condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and shall be
kept free from refuse, debris and weeds.
      4.   The lot owner shall replace dead plant materials as required by this
section.  Replacement must occur within one hundred eighty (180) days from the
date on which the City Planner notifies the lot owner of the dead plant
materials.  Replacement plant materials should be of reasonably similar
character to the plant materials being replaced.  At a minimum, replacement-
plant materials shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this
section.  Failure to replace dead plant materials as required by this section
shall constitute a violation of this section.
      5.   Nothing in this section shall prohibit or restrict the City or any
public utility company from trimming trees or removing plant materials that are
a hazard to its employees, to its utility facilities or to the public, or that
may threaten or interfere with the provision of continuous services by the City
or the public utility company.
   E.   Phased Development
      Each phase of a phased project shall comply with requirements of this
section.  The portion(s) of a lot left for subsequent phases shall, at a
minimum, equal the minimum lot size required by this ordinance for the zoning
district in which the lot is located.  No building permit shall be issued for a
subsequent phase of the project until all requirements of this section have
been satisfied on the completed phases.
   F.   Floodway/Floodplain
      On sites where a floodway exists, the floodway will be subtracted from
the total lot area when calculating the landscape requirements.  Therefore,
plant materials in the floodway will not be applicable in satisfying the
requirements of this section.  Area located in a floodplain but not a floodway
will not be subtracted from the total lot area when calculating the
requirements of this section.  Therefore, plant materials in the floodplain but
not in the floodway may be preserved to satisfy the requirements of this
section.
   G.   Parkways, ROW, and Easements
      With the exception of sod, grasses and groundcovers, landscaping in
utility easements, parkways, and public rights-of-way shall be prohibited,
except with the prior written consent of the City Planner and all affected
utilities.  Any damage or interference with utility lines or other utility
facilities resulting from landscape placement, landscape installation or from
negligence by the lot owner, or the agent or employees of the owner, in the
installation and/or maintenance of required landscaping is the responsibility
of the lot owner.  If permitted landscaping that is installed in a utility
easement, or required landscaping installed adjacent to an easement or public
right-of-way, is damaged or killed in conjunction with the maintenance of
utilities or right-of-way, it shall be the responsibility of the lot owner to
repair said landscaping and replace any plant materials that are dead or
damaged.  It is the responsibility of the lot owner (surface owner) to maintain
sod, grasses and groundcovers in any rights-of-way and/or easements located on
the lot.
   H.   Compliance Required
      A certificate of occupancy shall be withheld until the applicant for the
certificate of occupancy demonstrates compliance with all applicable
requirements of this section.
9-112   Landscape Plan Required
   A.   Applicability

family dwelling and its accessory uses (if any).
      4.   This section does not apply to any lot on which there is no
development.
      5.   This section does not apply to any expansion of an existing
development if the expansion will not do any of the following:
         a.   increase the total square footage of a building and its
associated parking lot by twenty-five percent (25%) or more; or
         b.   increase the number of stories of a building and increase the

      6.   The requirements of this section do not apply to that portion of a
parking lot that existed before the effective date of this section.
      7.   The requirements of this section shall not apply to a lawful non-
conforming development.  However, except as expressly provided otherwise in
this section, an abandonment, expansion, destruction or change in use of a
lawful non-conforming development shall cause the lawful non-conforming
development to lose its status as a lawful non-conforming development and said
development shall thereafter be subject to the requirements of this section. 
For purposes of this section, "destruction" of a lawful non-conforming
development means damage by fire, explosion, flood, tornado, or similar
catastrophic event where the cost of repair exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
reasonable value of the lawful non-conforming development as the lawful non-
conforming development existed prior to the damage.
      8.   The requirements of this section shall not apply to the
reconstruction of a lawful non-conforming development due to damage by fire,
explosion, flood, tornado, or similar catastrophic event if the damage to the
lawful non-conforming development does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
reasonable value of the lawful non-conforming development as the lawful non-
conforming development existed prior to the damage.
      9.   Anything to the contrary in this section notwithstanding, this
section shall apply in each instance where a one-family dwelling or a two-
family dwelling exists in a zoning district other than SF or TF and a change in
occupancy results in a more intensive use.
      10.   Anything to the contrary in this section notwithstanding, this
section applies in each instance where a lot is rezoned from either SF or TF to
a zoning classification other than SF or TF and the lot or any portion of the
lot is converted to a use that is not allowed in either SF or TF zoning
districts.
      11.   For any lot greater than two (2) acres in size, the applicant may
request that this section apply to only a portion of said lot.  The applicant
must specify the portion of the lot to which this section will apply.  The
portion specified by the applicant must, at a minimum, include the entire
portion of the lot on which any development is proposed.  In addition, the size
of the excluded lot area must, at  minimum, equal the minimum lot size required
by this ordinance for the zoning district in which the lot is located.  For
purposes of this section, the term "excluded lot area" means the area of the
lot that lies outside the portion specified by the applicant.  The City Planner
shall not approve the applicant's request if the request violates the spirit or
intent of this article or fails to comply with this article.  The City Planner
shall not approve the request if approval of the request would result in
exempting from this section any then-existing development to which this section
already applies.
   B.   Landscape Plan Requirements
      1.   A landscape plan shall be submitted to the City Planner as a part of
the application for a building permit, pre-submission proposal, or certificate

Chapter 43 of the Longview City Code or (b) Sections 9-108 through 9-112,
inclusive, of this ordinance.  The landscape plan shall show compliance with
all applicable provisions of Sections 9-108 through 9-112, inclusive, and with
all applicable provisions of Chapter 43 of the Longview City Code.  A site plan
submitted pursuant to Section 7-200 of this ordinance may also serve as a
landscape plan under this section if the site plan meets all the requirements
applicable to a landscape plan under this section.
      2.   The landscape plan shall consist of a minimum of four prints.  The
landscape plan must have a scale of 1:50, or greater, and be depicted on a
standard twenty-four (24) inch by thirty-six (36) inch page.  A landscape plan
which cannot be drawn in its entirety on a twenty-four (24) inch by thirty-six
(36) inch sheet must be drawn with appropriate match lines on two (2) or more
sheets.
      3.   The landscape plan may be provided by any individual, provided that
the landscape plan is legible and clearly denotes compliance with the
requirements of this section.  Plans that do not clearly demonstrate compliance
with this section, or that do not comply with all applicable regulations, will
be returned unapproved.

of Chapter 43 of the Longview City Code.  Such other information may include,
but is not limited to, elevations, cross-sections and/or renderings
demonstrating such compliance.
   D.   Landscape Plan Amendments
      The City Planner may approve amendments to an approved landscape plan if
the plan, as amended, complies with all applicable requirements of Sections 9-
108 through 9-112, inclusive, of this ordinance.
9-113   Variances
   The Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Longview, as constituted in
Article 18 of this ordinance, and in accordance with the applicable procedures
described in Section 18 of this ordinance, shall be authorized in specific
cases, to grant variances from Sections 9-108, 9-109, 9-110, and 9-111 of this
ordinance.  A variance may be granted if an applicant demonstrates that a
variance would not be contrary to the public interest, and, due to special

Article 10
Vehicle Parking Regulations
 
10-100   General
   A.   In any district except Central Business (CB), the off-street parking
regulations are listed by use in Section 10-104.
   B.   When a lot is used for a combination of uses, off-street parking
requirements are the sum of the requirements for each use and no off-street
parking space for one use is included in the calculation of off-street parking
requirements for any other use.  However, with regard to classrooms, fellowship
halls, meeting rooms, offices, and any other multi-purpose rooms or buildings
built in conjunction with a church or rectory, the off-street parking
requirements shall not be the sum of the requirements for each use.  Instead,
the off-street parking requirements for a church or rectory and any multi-
purpose rooms or buildings built in conjunction with a church or rectory shall
be as specified in Section 10-104(C)(2) of this ordinance. (Ordinance No. 3212)
   C.   The following floor areas are excluded in computation of required off-
street parking:
      1.   floor area devoted to off-street parking.
      2.   floor area of a private balcony that is not accessible to the public
and does not provide a means of ingress or egress.
      3.   areas such as display windows that are permanently designed to
display a product or advertise for services and are less than ten (10) feet in
width.
      4.   areas between the exterior entrance doors and utilized floor area of
the building commonly referred to as air stops or vestibules.
   D.   In determining required number of parking spaces, fractional spaces are
counted to the nearest whole number, the one-half (½) counted as an additional

   B.   when on the effective date of this ordinance, the use or structure was
in existence and lawfully constructed, located and operating in accordance with

definite periods of time subject to such regulations as the Board of Adjustment

facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent

conditions and safeguards, authorize the following special exceptions to the
regulations herein established.
   A.   Permit the reconstruction, extension or enlargement of a building
occupied by a nonconforming use on the lot or tract occupied by such building
provided such reconstruction does not prevent the return of such property to a
conforming use, and permit the expansion of off-street parking or off-street
loading for a nonconforming use.
   B.   Permit such modifications of the height, yard, area, coverage and
parking regulations as may be necessary to secure appropriate development of a
parcel of land which differs from other parcels in the district by being of
such restricted area, shape or slope that it cannot be appropriately developed
without such modification.
   C.   Require the discontinuance of non- conforming uses of land or structure
under any plan whereby the full value of the structure and facilities can be
amortized within a definite period of time, taking into consideration the
general character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to
conform to the regulations of this Ordinance. All actions to discontinue a
nonconforming use of land and structure, shall be taken with due regard for the
property rights of the persons affected when considered in the light of the
public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the designated
nonconforming use, and the conservation and preservation of property. The Board

Building Inspector, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon
which it is required to pass under this Ordinance or to affect any variance in
said Ordinance.

of the Board of Adjustment or any taxpayer or any officer, department or board
of the municipality may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified,
