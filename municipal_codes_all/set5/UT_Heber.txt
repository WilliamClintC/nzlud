Preface
The Heber City Municipal Code maintains a structure by subject matter using a decimal numbering
system identifying the title, chapter, and section (for example: 1.01.010). The first number in the
sequence designates the title. The second series of number designated the chapter. The last series of
number designates the section. This number is designed to aid in searching the Municipal Code and to
assist in subsequent codification as new ordinances are added to the Municipal Code.
Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed for future use and may be marked "Reserved" to
ease internal expansion. The legislative history identifies the specific legal sources of a section as may
be provided in footnotes.
The Municipal Code is supplemented from time to time with amendments and additions made by
ordinances passed by the Heber City Council. The specific legal sources that comprise this Municipal
Code have been adapted during the codification process from the original formatting of the official hard
copy. In the event of discrepancies between the online Municipal Code and the official hard copy, the
official hard copy governs. Municipal Code Online, Inc., provides a searchable database of the Municipal
Code for easy reference and convenience.
NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT OTHER RULES PROMULGATED UNDER
THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING OTHER REGULATIONS AND TECHNICAL
SPECIFICATION. THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT
VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED
ONLINE. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT THE CITY OFFICE AT PHONE NUMBER AND/OR

2. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or consumption in this municipality
of tangible personal property from any retailer on or after the operative date of this
chapter at the rate of one percent of the sales price of the property.
3. For the purposes of this chapter all retail sales shall be presumed to have been
consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal
property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out-of state destination. In the event a retailer has no
permanent place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are
consummated shall be as determined under the rules and regulations prescribed by and
adopted by the State Tax Commission. Public utilities as defined by Title 54, Utah Code
Annotated, 1953, as amended, shall not be obligated to determine the place or places
within any county or municipality where public utilities services are rendered, but the

amended, the State of Utah is named or referred to as the taxing agency the name of this
municipality shall be substituted therefor. Nothing in subparagraph (b) shall be deemed to
require substitution of the name of the municipality for the word "state" when that word is
used as part of the title of the State Tax Commission, or of the Constitution of Utah, nor
shall the name of the municipality be substituted for that of the State in any section when
the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the
municipality or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Tax Commission in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.
3. If an annual license has been issued to a retailer under Section 59-12-106 of the Utah
Code Annotated, 1953, as amended, an additional license shall not be required by reason
of this section.
4. There shall be excluded from the purchase price paid or charged by which the tax is
measured:
a. The amount of any sales or use tax imposed by the State of Utah on a retailer or
consumer;
b. The gross receipts from the sale or the cost of storage, use or other consumption
of tangible personal property upon which a sales or use tax has become due by
reason of the same transaction to any other municipality and any county in the
State of Utah, under the sales or use tax ordinance enacted by that county or
municipality in accordance with the Sales and Use Tax Act.

match the low bid submitted by non-local providers as follows:
1. When a quotation or bid for supplies, equipment, services, or materials from a non-local
provider (from outside Wasatch County) submitted in response to a quote invitation or bid
request is the low bid price, AND there is a local bidder whose bid or quote is within ten
(10%) percent of the lowest bid of the non-local bidder(s), the purchase shall be awarded
to the local bidder provided he/she agrees to meet the low quote or bid of the lowest nonlocal
bidder within two business days after notification.
2. In the event that more than one local bidder (within the boundaries of Wasatch County)
shall notify Heber City of his/her willingness to meet the low quote or bid of the lowest
non-local bidder, the purchase shall be awarded to the willing local bidder who was the
lowest local bidder originally. If there are two or more equally low local bidders, then the
local bidder to which the purchase is awarded shall be the local bidder whose original bid
was first received by the City.
H. Single Bids The City Manager or his/her designee may require a price or cost analysis if only
one bid is received. The bidder may be required to furnish a detailed cost proposal, and the bid
award shall be subject to subsequent negotiation.

ratification at its next regularly scheduled meeting. All change orders shall be reported monthly to

experiences of City officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property
from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door Solicitation, the

promote the Citys substantial interests in:
A. respecting citizens' decisions regarding privacy in their residences;
B. protecting persons from criminal conduct;

B. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on
the community presented to the City Council; on findings incorporated in the cases of City of
Renton v. Playtime theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426
U.S. 50 (1976); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); OConnor v. City and County of
Denver, 894 F.2d 1210 (10th Cir. 1990); Z.J. Gifts D-2, L.L.C. v. City of Aurora, 136 F.3d 683
(10th Cir. 1998); Dodgers Bar & Grill, Inc. v. Johnson County, 98 F.3d 1262 (10th Cir. 1996);
Connection Distrib. Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281 (6th Cir. 1998); Sundance Assocs. v. Reno, 139
F.3d 804 (10th Cir. 1998); American Library Association v. Reno, 33 F.3d 78 (D.C. Cir. 1994);

Advertising, Inc. v. Giani, 199 F.3d 1241; MS News Co. v. Casado, 721 F.2d 1281 (10th Cir.
1983); Cortese v. Black, No. 95-1429, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 15311 (10th Cir., June 25, 1996);
Salt Lake City v. Wood,1999 Utah App. 323, 991 P.2d 595 (Utah Ct. App. 1999); United States v.
Freedberg, 724 F.Supp. 851 (D. Utah 1989); and on studies and findings in other cities and
counties contained in the record before the County Planning Commission, the City Council finds
as follows:
1. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy
activities.
2. Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented
businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or rooms for
viewing films, videos, or live sexually oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in
spreading communicable diseases, such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
3. Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities
creates unhealthy conditions.
4. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because
of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their
facilities.
5. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of
sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films.
6. The findings noted in paragraphs number (a) through (e) raise substantial governmental
concerns.
7. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be
reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
8. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of
that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on
operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the
health, safety and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
County. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control of the
premises and activities occurring therein.
9. The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will further the substantial
governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex-related crimes, including
illegal sex acts, and protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
7/17/2019 Print Preview

10. Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented businesses and requiring
sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in
adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter
and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental
interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
11. Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will advance the
substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of
sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this
Chapter and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial
governmental interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
12. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the dayto-
day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses, and by employees of
such businesses, will facilitate the enforcement of the provision of this Chapter and other
federal, state and local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest
in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
13. A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an
appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business.
14. Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented
businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of
sexually related criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of
sexually transmitted diseases.

This section defines a nuisance by providing five general definitions of what constitutes a nuisance

nuisances (subsection B). The purpose of the general definitions is to allow the City to classify an
offending situation, conduct or activity as a nuisance, even though the situation, conduct or activity may
not be listed as a nuisance in the specific examples. The first three general definitions are taken directly
from Utah Code Annotated (U.C.A.). The purpose of listing the specific examples is to identify some of
the specific situations, conduct and activities that the City intends to abate as nuisances.
A. General definitions of Nuisance. Any activity that meets any one or more of the five definitions
set forth below shall constitute a Nuisance if it occurs within the City of Heber.

8.04.050 Responsibility For Nuisances
The Responsible Person(s) is responsible for abating nuisances pursuant to this ordinance. Any person,
whether owner, agent or occupant, who creates, aids in creating, or contributes to a nuisance, or who
supports, continues or retains a nuisance is responsible for the nuisance and is therefore a Responsible
Person pursuant to this ordinance. Every successive owner or tenant of a property or premises who fails
to abate a continuing nuisance upon or in the use of such property or premises caused by a former
owner or tenant is responsible therefore in the same manner as the one who first created it.

8.04.070 Finding A Nuisance - Responsibility
If a Neighborhood Preservation Officer finds that a nuisance exists, the Neighborhood Preservation
Officer shall attempt to have the Responsible Person abate the nuisance. Although the Neighborhood
Preservation Officers first step in correcting or abating the nuisance will always be to obtain voluntary
compliance, the Neighborhood Preservation Officer may pursue any remedy or combination of remedies
available pursuant to this ordinance, State law or common law in order to abate the nuisance. Nothing in
this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the City from engaging in its standard prosecution practices.
Therefore, the City may prosecute violators of City ordinances or State laws without having to comply
with the provisions of this ordinance, even though the activity or conduct prosecuted may also constitute
a nuisance under this ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance shall be interpreted to prevent the City from
enforcing applicable City ordinances, building codes, or the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings code
without first treating the offending conduct, situation or activity as a nuisance pursuant to this ordinance.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2003-19 on 9/4/2003
8.04.080 Voluntary Correction
This section applies whenever the Neighborhood Preservation Officer or other peace officer determines
that a nuisance exists.
A. Contact. Before taking other steps to abate the nuisance, the Neighborhood Preservation Officer,
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=8_Health_And_Sanitation 10/22
or other peace officer, shall make a reasonable attempt to secure voluntary correction or
abatement of the nuisance by:
1. Contacting Responsible Person, where and when possible;
2. Explaining the nuisance;
3. Requesting the Responsible Person to abate the nuisance; and
4. Agreeing to terms with the Responsible Person to abate the nuisance.
B. No Agreement. If the Neighborhood Preservation Officer and the Responsible Person cannot
agree to terms for correcting or abating the nuisance, the Neighborhood Preservation Officer, or
other peace officer, may still abate the nuisance using one or more of the procedures set forth in
this ordinance, State law, or common law.
C. Voluntary Correction Agreement. If the Neighborhood Preservation Officer and the Responsible
Person agree to terms for abating the nuisance, they shall enter into and sign a Voluntary
Correction Agreement. The Voluntary Correction Agreement is a contract between the City and
the Responsible Person in which the Responsible Person agrees to abate the nuisance within
a specified time and according to specified conditions. The voluntary Correction Agreement
shall include the following terms:
1. The name and address of the Responsible Person;
2. The street address of the nuisance, or a description sufficient to identify the building,
structure, premises, or land upon which or within which the nuisance is occurring;
3. A description of the nuisance;
4. The necessary corrective action to be taken, and a date or time by which the corrections
must be completed;
5. An agreement by the Responsible Person that the City may inspect the premises as may
be necessary to determine compliance with the Voluntary Correction Agreement;
6. An agreement by the Responsible Person that the City may abate the nuisance and
recover its costs and expenses to abate the nuisance, as well as a monetary fine
pursuant to this ordinance from the Responsible Person, if terms of the Voluntary
Correction Agreement are not met;
7. An agreement by the Responsible Person acknowledging that he/she waives the right to
appeal the Neighborhood Preservation Officers finding that a nuisance exists and waives
the right to appeal the specific corrective action required in the Voluntary Correction
Agreement; and
8. An agreement by the Responsible Person that failure to comply with the Voluntary
Correction Agreement may be grounds for criminal prosecution. The Neighborhood
Preservation Officer may grant an extension of the time limit for correcting or abating the
nuisance if the Responsible Person has shown due diligence and/or substantial progress
in correcting or abating the nuisance but unforseen circumstances render abatement
under the original conditions unattainable. If the Responsible Person complies with the
terms of the Voluntary Correction Agreement, the City shall take no action against the
Responsible Person related to the nuisance described in the Voluntary Correction
Agreement unless the nuisance recurs.

8.04.090 Administrative Citation
A. Administrative Citation. When the Neighborhood Preservation Officer determines that a nuisance

Neighborhood Preservation Officer may issue an administrative citation without having attempted
to secure voluntary correction as provided in Section 8.04.080 under the
following circumstances:
1. When an emergency exists; or
2. When the Neighborhood Preservation Officer is unable to locate or determine the identity
of the Responsible Person.
B. Content of Administrative Citation. The administrative citation shall include the following:
1. The name and address of the Responsible Person; and
2. The street address of the nuisance or a description sufficient for identifying the building,

3. A description of the nuisance; and
4. The required corrective action; and
5. The Completion Date and a notice that the City may abate the nuisance and charge the
Responsible Person for all abatement costs if the Responsible Person does not correct

for filing an appeal.
7. A statement indicating that no monetary fine will be assessed if the Neighborhood
Preservation Officer approved the completed, required corrective action prior to
the Completion Date; and
8. A statement that the City may abate the nuisance and assess costs and expenses of
abatement and a monetary fine against the Responsible Person if the correction is not
completed by the Responsible Person and approved by the Neighborhood Preservation
Officer on or before the Completion Date.
C. Service of Administrative Citation. The Neighborhood Preservation Officer shall serve the
administrative citation upon the Responsible Person, either personally or by mailing,
certified, return receipt requested, a copy of the administrative citation to the Responsible Person
at his/her last known address. If the Responsible Person cannot after reasonable attempts be
personally served within Wasatch County and if an address for mailed service cannot after
reasonable attempts be ascertained, notice shall be served by posting a copy of the
administrative citation conspicuously on the affected property or structure. Proof of service shall
be made by a written declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the person effecting the
service, declaring the time and date of service, the manner by which the service was made, and
if by posting, the facts showing that reasonable attempts were used in attempting to serve the

8.04.100 Other Remedies
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=8_Health_And_Sanitation 12/22
The City may take one or more of the following actions against any Responsible Person who fails to
comply with the terms of the Voluntary Consent Agreement, and Administrative Citation or an order
of the Hearing Officer:
A. Abatement by the City.
1. The City may abate a nuisance when:
a. The terms of a Voluntary Correction Agreement have not been met; or
b. The requirements of an administrative citation have not been complied with, or, if
the administrative citation is appealed to a Hearing Officer and the terms of the
administrative citation are amended by the Hearing Officer, the terms of the
Hearing Officers order have not been complied with; or
c. The condition is subject to summary abatement as provided in subsection 2,
below.
2. Whenever a nuisance is occurring which constitutes an immediate and emergent threat to
public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the City may summarily and
without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason
for it, shall be given to the Responsible Person as soon as reasonably possible after the
abatement.
3. Using any lawful means, the City may enter upon the subject property and may remove or
correct the condition which is subject to abatement. The City may seek, but is not
required to seek, such judicial process as it deems necessary to effect the removal or
correction of the condition.
4. The costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting or abating the violation shall be
billed to the Responsible Person and/or the owner, lessor, tenant or other person entitled
to control, use and/or occupy the property and shall become due and payable to the City
within ten (10) days of the mailing date if the bill is mailed. The term Incidental Expenses
includes, but is not limited to:
a. Personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney fees and costs;
b. Costs including in documenting the violation;
c. Hauling, storage and disposal expenses;
d. Actual expenses and costs for the City in preparing notices, specifications and
contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and inspecting the work; and
e. The costs of any required printing and mailing.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=8_Health_And_Sanitation 13/22
B. Monetary Fine. The Responsible Person shall pay the City a monetary fine for each day the
nuisance continues after the Completion Date. The nuisance shall be considered to continue
until the Neighborhood Preservation Officer approves the Responsible Persons actions to
correct or abate the nuisance. The amount of the monetary fine shall be as follows:
1. One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per day for each day during their first week that the
nuisance remains uncorrected or unabated after the Completion Date;
2. Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per day for each day thereafter until the nuisance is
corrected or abated according to the terms set forth in the administrative citation. The
monetary fine shall be cumulative and may not be waived by the Neighborhood
Preservation Officer. Payment of a monetary fine pursuant to the section does not relieve
the Responsible Person from the duty to abate the nuisance as required by the Voluntary
Consent Agreement or the Administrative Citation. The monetary fine constitutes a
personal obligation of the Responsible Person. Any monetary fine assessed must be paid
to the City within (10) calendar days from the date of mailing of the Hearing Officers
decision and order or a notice from the City that the fine is due. The City Attorney and
his/her designee is authorized to take appropriate action to collect the monetary fine, plus
reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in collecting said monetary fine.
C. Civil Actions. Either the City or any private person directly affected by a nuisance may bring civil
action to abate or enjoin the nuisance, or for damages for causing or maintaining the
nuisance (including cost, if any, of cleaning the subject property). The civil action may be brought
pursuant to this ordinance or pursuant to State law.
D. Criminal Actions. Criminal actions may be initiated by criminal citation from the Neighborhood
Preservation Officer or by long form Information.
1. Any person who maintains or assists in maintaining a nuisance is guilty of a Class C
misdemeanor. No person shall be prosecuted under this subsection (1) unless the
Neighborhood Preservation Officer first attempted to obtain voluntary correction as
provided in section 8.04.080 of this ordinance.
2. If the alleged nuisance is also a violation of a provision of City Code (other than this
nuisance ordinance) or State law, the Responsible Person may be charged under the
specific provision of City Code or State law, even if the Neighborhood Preservation
Officer did not first attempt to obtain voluntary correction as provided in section of
8.04.080 of this ordinance.
3. Any person who knowingly obstructs, impedes, or interferes with the City or its agents, or
with the Responsible Person, in the performance of duties imposed by this ordinance, or
a decision and Order issued by the Hearing Officer, or a Voluntary Correction Agreement,
is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.
E. Abatement by Eviction. Whenever there is reason to believe that a nuisance under section
8.04.030(B) (1-7) is kept and maintained , or exists in the City, the City Attorney or any
citizen(s) residing in the City, in his or her own names, may maintain an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction to abate the nuisance and obtain an order for the automatic eviction of the
tenant of the property harboring the nuisance. The eviction shall take place as specified in Utah
law.
F. Lien for Costs. If a person fails to pay any fines or costs related to nuisance abatement when
due, the City may record a lien on the property or premises associated with the nuisance for the
full amount of unpaid fines and costs.

G. Non-exclusive Remedies. The City may take any or all of the above-mentioned remedies
(administrative, civil or criminal) to abate a nuisance and/or punish any person or entity
who creates, causes or allows a nuisance to exist. The abatement of a nuisance does not
prejudice the right of the City or any person to recover damages or penalties for its past
existence.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2003-19 on 9/4/2003
8.04.110 Appeals
A. Grounds. Any person receiving an administrative citation may appeal the administrative citation
to the Hearing Officer. Only the following issues may be appealed to the Hearing Officer:
1. The person charged in the administrative citation as the Responsible Person is not the
Responsible Person as defined by this ordinance.
2. The condition described as a nuisance in the administrative citation is not a nuisance as
defined by this ordinance.
3. The method required by the administrative citation to abate the nuisance is inappropriate
or is not the most cost effective method of effectively correcting or abating the nuisance.
4. The time period given to abate the nuisance in the administrative citation is unreasonable.
5. The monetary fine set forth in the administrative citation is unreasonable.
6. The Neighborhood Preservation Officer refused to approve a corrective action that met
the requirements of the administrative citation.
7. The Responsible Person claims that the requirement(s) of the administrative citation
violates his/her constitutional rights.
B. Filing. The person desiring to appeal must file a notice of appeal within ten (10) days of receipt of
the administrative citation or within fifteen (15) days of the mailing date if the
administrative citation was mailed.
C. Hearing. The hearing before the Hearing Officer shall be informal according to rules and
procedures established by the Hearing Officer. The appellant may, but is not required to, bring
an attorney or other representative to assist him or her. The appellant and the Neighborhood
Preservation Officer may each call witnesses at the hearing. The Hearing Officer may, with or
without the parties present, visit the site of the alleged nuisance. If the Hearing Officer allows
parties at the site visit, both parties must be given the opportunity to be present. The hearing
shall be scheduled by the Hearing Officer within thirty (30) days of when the notice of appeal is
filed with the City.
D. Burden of Proof. The appellant shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by
a preponderance of the evidence that he/she had legitimate grounds for the appeal. The
determination of the Neighborhood Preservation Officer as to the need for the required corrective
action shall be accorded substantial weight by the Hearing Officer in determining the
reasonableness of the corrective action.

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=8_Health_And_Sanitation 15/22
E. Authority of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall have authority to affirm or vacate the
administrative citation, or to modify or waive specific provisions of the administrative citation. If
the appellant fails to attend the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall affirm the
administrative citation. The Hearing Officer shall not vacate the administrative citation unless
he/she finds that no nuisance exists. The Hearing Officer shall modify the administrative citation
if he/she finds that a nuisance exists, but that one or more of the requirements of the
administrative citation is improper or inappropriate. A requirement is improper if it is contrary to
this ordinance. A requirement is inappropriate if the Hearing Officer finds that there is a better
means of resolving the problem or that the proposed solution is inappropriate given the nature or
severity of the problem. When determining whether to waive or modify a requirement of the
administrative citation , the Hearing Officer may also consider:
1. Whether the appellant responded to the Neighborhood Preservation Officers attempts to
contact the appellant and cooperated with efforts to correct the nuisance;
2. Whether the appellant has shown due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting
the nuisance;
3. The financial ability of the appellant and the amount , if any, that the appellant has
benefitted financially by maintaining a nuisance.
4. Any other relevant factors.
If the appellant appeals the Neighborhood Preservation Officers refusal to approve
the appellants corrective action, the Hearing Officer shall visit the site and determine if
the appellant complied with the requirements of the administrative citation.
F. Order. The Hearing Officer shall issue a written Order to the appellant and the Neighborhood
Preservation Officer notifying them of his/her decision. The Order shall include the Hearing
Officers findings of fact and ultimate decision. If the Hearing Officer modifies or
waives provisions of the administrative citation, the Order shall specify which portions are
modified and how they are modified. The Hearing Officer shall mail a copy of the Order to the
appellant and the City within five (5) working days of the close of the hearing.
G. Appeal to Heber City Justice Court. Either the City or the appellant may appeal the Hearing
Officers Order by filing a petition for review of the Order. The petition must be filed in the Heber
City Justice Court within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the Hearing Officers Order
was mailed to the appellant. In the petition, the plaintiff may only allege that the Hearing Officers
order was arbitrary, capricious or illegal. The Hearing Officer shall transmit to the reviewing court
the record of its proceedings, including any minutes, findings, orders and, if available, a true and
correct transcript of its proceedings.
If, in the opinion of the Justice Court, there is a sufficient record to review the Hearing
Officers Order, the Courts review is limited to the record provided by the Hearing Officer. The
Justice Court may not accept or consider any evidence outside the Hearing Officers record
unless the evidence was offered to the Hearing Officer and the Court determines that it was
improperly excluded by the Hearing Officer. If, in the opinion of the Justice Court, there is not a
sufficient record to review the Hearing Officers Order, the Court may call witnesses and take
evidence. No petition or appeal may be filed in Justice Court unless the Responsible Person first
appeals to the Hearing Officer pursuant to the terms set forth in this ordinance.

in containers in excess of "applicable threshold planning quantities" as specified in SARA Title III.
Examples of possible pollution sources include, but are not limited to, the following: storage
facilities that store the liquid forms of extremely hazardous substances, septic tanks, drain fields,

which may potentially contaminate ground water. A pollution source is also a PCS.
E. Regulatory Agency means any governmental agency with jurisdiction over hazardous waste as
defined herein.
F. Sanitary Landfill means a disposal site where solid wastes, including putrescible wastes, or
hazardous wastes, are disposed of on land by placing earth cover thereon.
G. Septic Tank/Drain-field Systems means a system which is comprised of a septic tank and a
drain-field which accepts domestic wastewater from buildings or facilities for subsurface

It is hereby declared that the occurrence of false alarms at premises protected by emergency alarm
systems constitutes both a nuisance and a hazard to life and property. In light of (1) the traffic danger
inherent in the emergency response of police, fire and emergency response vehicles and personnel (2)
the danger caused by possible decreased caution on the part of emergency personnel responding to
a location where previous false alarms have occurred, and (3) the cost of money and manpower to
respond where no actual emergency exists, the City finds it necessary to the health, safety and welfare
of the citizens to enact the following provisions governing alarm systems.

For the purpose of this Article, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning set forth herein:
A. Alarm System means any mechanism, equipment or device which is designed to detect an
unauthorized entry into any building or onto any property, or to direct attention to a fire, robbery,
burglary or other emergency in progress, and to signal the above occurrences either by a local or
audible alarm or by silent or remote alarm. The following devices shall not constitute an alarm
system within the meaning of this subsection:
1. Devices which do not register alarms that are audible, visible or perceptible outside the
protected premises;
2. Devices which are not installed, operated or used for the purpose of reporting an
emergency to the Department of Public Safety.
3. Alarm devices affixed to motor vehicles; and
4. Alarm devices installed on a temporary basis by the Department of Safety.

commission of a robbery, burglary or other criminal action.
D. Emergency Personnel means peace officers, firefighters, paramedics and emergency medical

negligently or accidentally activated signals; signs which are the result of faulty, malfunctioning or
improperly installed or maintained equipment; signals which are purposely activated to summon
emergency personnel to non-emergency situations; and alarms for which the actual cause is not
determined. False alarms also include an alarm signal caused by conditions of nature which are
normal for that area. False Alarm does not include an alarm signal caused by extraordinarily
violent conditions of nature which cannot be reasonably anticipated by the alarm user.

A. Purpose: Uncontrolled sound amplification systems in vehicles disturb the peace and tranquility
of persons and neighborhoods within the vicinity of the sound and creates traffic
hazards. Excessively loud music and sounds distract other drivers and interfere with the sounds
of police and other emergency vehicles. Noise from sound amplification systems in vehicles
cannot be practically regulated by imposing decibel limits as decibel measurements are difficult
to obtain from moving vehicles.
B. For the purpose of this section Sound Amplification System means any device,
system, whether electrical or mechanical or otherwise for amplifying sound or for producing or
reproducing sound; including, but not limited to any radio, stereo, musical instrument, compact
disc or cassettes.
1. Except as authorized by law, no person shall operate or permit the operation of any
sound amplification system in or on a vehicle in such a manner or with such a high
volume as to disturb or annoy the quiet, peace, comfort or repose of any person or
neighborhood in the vicinity.
2. Except as authorized by law, no person shall operate or permit the operation of any
sound amplification system in or on a vehicle which can be heard at a distance with onehundred
feet (100').
C. Exceptions:
1. Amplification systems being operated to request assistance of an emergency nature or to
warn of a hazardous situation;
2. Authorized emergency vehicles;
3. Vehicles operated by utility companies;
4. Vehicles used in parades, concerts, festivals, fairs or similar activities.
5. Amplification systems in vehicles which are operated on private property with the
permission of the owner and which are not audible beyond the property line.
D. Violations of Article 9.60 are a Class C Misdemeanor.

the ground groomed; however, the City is not responsible for inadvertent scratches and chips that occur
from routine maintenance. Such happenings are a risk assumed by the owners of the monuments and
are a condition that go with the privilege of placing markers within the cemetery.

There is an underlying policy in the City, strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving
Constitutional Taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of
the uncertainty and expense involved in defending law suits alleging such issues. At the same time, the
legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the public's right
to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the Federal and State Constitutions.
Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for review of actions that may
involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist governments in considering

Adopted by Ord. 249 Art. 2 §3 on 1/1/1979
13.08.050 Mandatory Hookup
A. For the purpose of defraying the cost of construction, reconstruction, maintenance or operation of
the City sewer system and for public health purposes, the owners of all buildings used for human
occupancy are required to connect to the City sewer system where the sewer is available and
within 300 feet of the property line, unless, the property owner is willing to provide to the City an
adequate and convenient easement to allow the line to come within 300 feet of the building to be
served, then and in that event within 300 feet of the building. In order to enforce the mandatory
hookup to the sewer where available and the collection of reasonable charges for the use thereof
the City may make one charge for the combined use of water and the services of the sewer
system, including the services of any sewage treatment plant in which the City has an interest
and the City may require that application for service from such combined system shall be made
in writing, signed by the owner desiring such service or his authorized agent, in which application
such owner shall agree that he will pay for all service furnished such owner according to the rules
and regulations enacted by ordinance, resolution or motion.
B. In case an application for furnishing service from such combined systems shall be made by a
tenant of the owner, the City may require, as a condition of granting the same, that such
application contain an agreement signed by the owner or his duly authorized agent to the effect
that in consideration of granting such application, the owner will pay for all service furnished such
tenant or any other occupant of the premises named in the application in case such tenant or
occupant shall fail to pay for the same.

C. In case any person shall fail to hookup to the sewer where available and in case any applicant
shall fail to pay for the service furnished according to the rules and regulations prescribed by
ordinance, then the City may cause the water to be shut off from such premises and shall not be
required to turn the same on again until such person has hooked up to the sewer at his own
expense and/or all arrears for services furnished shall be paid in full.
D. Variances and special exceptions may be granted by the City Council wherein owing to special
conditions peculiar to the property a literal enforcement of mandatory hookup would either (a) be
impractical under the circumstances or (b) result in hardships which are unnecessary to carry out
the intention of this Section of the Code. However, before any variance or special exception is
granted, there must be shown and the City Council must find:
1. that the protection of the health of the citizenry and the protection of the public water
supply will not be compromised by the granting of a variance or special exception; and
2. that one or more of the following exists;
a. .strict adherence to this Section would cause a hardship that would be significantly
disproportionate to what others might be required to bear, the hardship of which
was not created by any act of the owner subsequent to the effective date of this
ordinance, and/or
b. the existence of special circumstances, such as (a) the existence of a physical
barrier (canal, major highway, or the like) that separate the building to be serviced
from the available line, (b) the need for a pump station, or (c) the inability to obtain
necessary access across the land of an adjacent property, that make it impractical
to strictly adhere. Being of limited means does not qualify as a 2.a. "hardship."
E. With respect to a pre-existing residential home, compliance may, upon application by the owner
of the home or upon motion and approval of the City Council, be postponed until the premises is
transferred or passes in whole or part to a third party if it has been determined and so long as it
remains determined by the Wasatch City/County Health Department that the health of the
citizenry and the protection of the public water supply is not being compromised by delaying the
date that the premises is required to come into compliance. If the date for coming into
compliance is continued as herein provided, the City Recorder shall cause a notice to be
recorded against the property putting the potential new owner on notice of the new owner's
obligation to forthwith, at the owner's expense, bring the property into compliance, including the
obligations to go to the source and to pay the impact and connection fees. Said notice shall
further inform the potential purchaser, heir, or beneficiary that the enforcement of this provision
may in part be enforced by the City refusing to service the premises with a culinary or secondary
watersupply.

rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the
average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge, sufficient to cover the costs of
treating such users above normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be 200
ppm BOD and 180 ppm TSS. The surcharge rate structure for such above normal strength waste
dischargers is set out in subsection B of this section.B.The City will determine the average total
suspended solids (TSS) and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) daily loadings for the
average residential user or in lieu of such a determination will consider the average residential strength
wastes to be 200 mg/l BOD5and 180 mgd/1 TSS. The City will assess a surcharge rate for all
nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average
residential user. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users above normal
strength wastes. Such users will pay an additional service charge set by resolution of the City Council.

service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user and equitable service
charge may be determined for each such user based upon an estimate of the total wastewater
contribution of this class of user. The governing body may classify industrial, commercial and other
nonresidential establishments as a residential user, provided that the wastes from these establishments
are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user with respect to volume, suspended solids,
and five-day twenty-degree centigrade biochemical oxygen demand. The rates charged for wastewater
service for all classes or types of users shall be set from time to time by resolution of the City Council.

existing sidewalks as connectors between standard trail sections, and, to locate or orient such
trails, or connectors to trails on and along the outside property boundaries, at the farthest
distance from homes and yards of private property, and to minimize infringement and
encroachment upon existing homes, property lines and private property.

17.30.020 Trail Design
A. Trail Function. Anticipated trail use will essentially determine what type of trail to construct and
where it will be built. There are two (2) general categories of trails: transportation and recreation,
yet it is perfectly acceptable and common for the uses to be concurrent.
1. Transportation trails are generally built as destination trails and primarily connect
neighborhoods with one another or with public facilities, which may include schools,
recreation centers, parks, town or resort centers, shopping areas, libraries, etc. The
purpose is to allow a non-motorized user a corridor that limits interference with motor
vehicle traffic and promotes non-motorized alternatives for short local trips. User types
may include cyclists, disabled users, walkers and a variety of other youth type activities.
2. Trails for recreation typically provide a connection to natural spaces and provide a range
of challenges and features for the trail user. Loop trails are the preferred design that will
allow users to begin and end at the same trailhead location. These trails typically connect
to open spaces, national forests, state parks and neighborhood parks. User groups may
include mountain and road cyclists, trail runners, equestrians, joggers, hikers and
walkers. Trail surfaces are generally soft surface or natural surfaces.
B. Trail Users. These standards are set for non-motorized use and focused on all age groups, all
levels of ability and generally include the following activity types: walkers, runners, joggers,
hikers, cyclists (both mountain and road), skateboarders, disabled users, wheelchairs,
equestrians, skiers, in-line skaters and baby movers ( carriages, strollers, joggers, etc.). While it
is clearly not practical for all types of trails in a mountainous environment to be fully accessible to
the disabled, where reasonably appropriate, trails should comply with the requirements of the
Americans with disabilities act of 1990 (ADA).

C. Americans With Disabilities Act. A trail is considered ADA accessible if it meets the following
criteria:
1. Five foot (5') minimum width.
2. Hard surfaces. Asphalt and concrete are the most accessible. Compacted crushed stone
with a diameter less than three-eighths inch (3/s") is also acceptable.
3. Trail grade less than five percent (5%).
4. Ramps, not stairs, should be provided for grades exceeding the five percent (5%)
maximum.
5. Ramp grades should not exceed eight percent (8%) and have a level landing for every
thirty inches (30") of vertical rise and have a slip resistant surface.
6. Thirty two inch (32") high handrails should be installed on all ramps and bridges.
7. Trails should have a rest area every three hundred feet (300'), preferably cleared with a
bench.
8. One or more accessible parking spaces should be provided at trail parking lots.
9. If gate or bollards are used to prevent motorized vehicle access to the trail, thirty two inch
(32") clearance is necessary for wheelchair access.

D. Trail Location. The following are guidelines for how trails should be routed to reduce
maintenance needs and environmental impacts while maximizing the trail experience:
1. General Guidelines:
a. Trails should be located and constructed in such a manner as to minimize
maintenance and maximize access. Alignment should utilize the natural
topography of the land and should follow natural contours where possible with
respect to surrounding landforms.
b. Design features should preserve and promote natural elements, including
geologic, scenic, wildlife and historic.
c. Construction must factor in erosion related to use and weather.
d. Trail design should consider the trail users experience. Alignments should avoid
excessive switchbacks or lengthy steep grades. When creating alignments,
consider intended volume, ability and type of user.
e. Locate trails for both summer and winter activities giving consideration to terrain
and climate. Identify snow retention areas for possible cross country ski trails. In
open areas, use trail alignments that take advantage of wind protection and
shaded canyon areas.
f. Because each trail site is unique, specific trail proposals through sensitive areas
need to be considered on a case by case basis.
g. Trails should be clearly separated from vehicle traffic. Users are generally safer
and travel experiences are enhanced on separated trails. Snow removal and
general maintenance are less costly when trails are separated from roads and
parking lots. At-grade crossings at roads should be limited.
h. The trail grade should not exceed half the grade of the hillside the trail is
traversing. This is primarily to limit erosion and is a general guideline. For
example, if you build across a hillside with a side slope of twenty percent (20% ),
the trail grade should not exceed ten percent (10%).

2. Standards For Grades, Vertical Clearance And Curve Radii:
a. Grades. Grades of five percent (5%) and below are acceptable for standard trail
sections. Grades above five percent (5%) cannot be considered wheelchair
accessible. Intersections should not exceed three percent (3%). Avoid sharp
curves on grades exceeding five percent (5%) to avoid confrontations between
different levels of users. The following table identifies lengths of trail for grades
above five percent (5%) (backcountry or natural surface trails may exceed these
grades for short distances, but must factor in appropriate erosion control
measures):
Grade (Percent) Limit On Length At That Grade
<5 None
5-6 800 feet
6-7 400 feet
7-8 200 feet
8-9 100 feet
9-10 50 feet
>10 0 feet
b. Line of Sight. Trail users need adequate sight line distances to anticipate changes
in the trail and trail users coming from the opposite direction. An optimal clear view
distance for bicyclists (the trail user traveling at the highest speed) is one hundred
fifty feet (1501). If this distance cannot be met, appropriate signing must be placed
to warn the user of curve ahead.
c. Vertical Clearance. Vertical clearance (or ceiling) is a ten foot (101) minimum. This
allows for all types of non-motorized users. If pathways will be prepared for use
during winter months, clearances should anticipate snow loading and be
increased to sixteen feet (161).
d. Curve Radii. Curve radii will vary between allowed uses on multiple user trails.
Bicycle standards should be followed, as this is the fastest moving user group
requiring longer sight distances. Refer to the "AASHTO Guide for Development of
Bicycle Facilities" for stopping distances, curve radii and intersection coordination.

3. Trail Types:
a. Improved Multi-Use Trail. Multi-use trails are major community arterial routes that
are non-motorized, independent of vehicular routes and provide adequate
separation from vehicles. They may bisect parks and open space, as well as
parallel natural features, such as rivers and streams. These trails are both
transportation and recreation oriented and should provide connections to cities,
towns, back county trails and trailheads, parks, points of interest, and other
transportation nodes. Where possible these trails should comply with AASHTO
standards.
b. Improved Pedestrian Trail. Improved pedestrian trails are collector trails (including
sidewalks) that are non-motorized and connect users to community trails. They
may bisect neighborhoods, open space, commercial developments, parks,
schools, etc., and parallel rivers and streams. Many existing pedestrian trails were
designed and constructed prior to the regional trails master plan. Where possible,
trials less than 8 feet wide should be widened and brought into current standards
to improve access to more users.
Future construction of major sidewalks that connect to the core trail network
should be adapted to meet the standards of improved pedestrian trails, which will
include an 8 foot wide tread surface. Efforts should be made to maintain a
consistent width and for residential sidewalks to remain between 4 to 8 feet.

c. Backcountry Trail. Backcountry trails (single-track type) are defined as trails that
provide access for users to explore areas outside of the urban trial network. These
non-motorized trails are typically designed and constructed for a variety of
recreational users, such as hikers, trail runners, mountain bikers, and equestrians.
Because they are located outside of the urban network, the surface typically
consists of natural dirt, creating an undeveloped feel for users. In some rare
cases, other materials, such as gravel, may be implemented to aid in erosion
control or stabilization. Backcountry trails are to be cut at a width of 4 feet.
In some cases, bridges, and boardwalks may be necessary to traverse though or
over natural features in the backcountry. These structures should be designed and
constructed to be compatible with all backcountry uses.

B. Improved Multi-use Trails. Improved multi-use trails are major community arterial routes within
the urban network. Because improved multi-use trails are designed for large volumes of users
with varying uses, the surface materials should be a durable pavement. Asphalt is the preferred
pavement type due to cost, ease of maintenance, and surface smoothness.
Typical pavement cross sections for an asphalt multi-use trail should consist of the following:
1. a properly graded and compacted sub-grade that has been stripped of all organics and,
2. lined with a structural weed barrier fabric;
3. a 6" depth of compacted road base material; and
4. a 3" depth of hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavement.
In some circumstances, concrete or concrete masonry unit (CMU) pavers may be used to
create a unique look or feel. These surfaces should be avoided in most areas due to the
uneven joints and score lines that cause undesirable riding experiences for cyclists.
For improved multi-use trails in Heber City, a tread width between 10 and 13 is
recommended. Trails with a 10-foot width should be actively pursued where cost and
space permit. A lesser width may be required by the planning department where
appropriate. 14 foot wide trails shall be used on trails identified on the trails plan as being
a collector trail or a regional connection. By constructing wider trails initially, the county,
cities, and other agencies will have made preparations for a growing population in the
area. Wider trails will also accommodate larger trail specific competitions and events (see
Figure 32). Maximum slope shall not exceed 5% except for short distances. All improved
multi use trails should be constructed within a 20 foot easement.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 28/64
C. Improved Pedestrian Trail. Improved pedestrian trails are more commonly referred to as
sidewalks. The objective of the master plan is that future construction of major sidewalks will be
adapted to meet the standards of improved pedestrian trials. The typical cross section of an
improved pedestrian trail in Heber City should include an 8 foot wide tread surface. Trail
construction should consist of a properly graded and compacted subgrade that has been stripped
of all organics and lined with a structural weed barrier fabric followed by a 4" thick concrete
pavement on top of a 6" depth of 3/4 " gravel or can be constructed with asphalt with a weed
barrier, and a 3" layer of hot mix asphalt over 611 compacted road base.
Efforts should be made to update all existing improved pedestrian routes in the urban system to
meet these standards. Residential and collector sidewalks can remain at 4 to 6 foot widths, but
primary sidewalks should be constructed at 8 feet wide. All improved pedestrian trails should be
constructed within a 20 foot easement.

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 29/64
D. Backcountry Trails. Backcountry trails, as classified in this document, are recreational trails
outside of the urban network. Because they are located outside the urban network, tread material
is often created from the natural sub-grade. In some cases other materials such as gravel may
be implemented to aid in erosion control and/or stabilization. In all cases, these materials should
be derived from adjacent areas to maintain a natural look and feel. Tread width of back country
trails will vary based on vegetation, obstacles, and use. In most cases, backcountry trails should
not exceed 48 inches wide within a 10 foot easement. Most backcountry trails will have a tread
width of 12 to 24 inches, depending on use. The slope of backcountry trails is ideally less than
8%, with a maximum of 10% for runs of less than 100 ft. Back country trails should only exceed
10% in rare circumstances as approved by the county.
All backcountry trails should be designated with a rating to allow potential riders to make safe
and informed decisions. The IMBA has developed a standard trail difficulty rating system
applicable to mountain bike trails. By providing ratings on trial signs in accordance with IMBA's
standards and by providing general trail characteristics such as total length, elevation change,
and projected trip times at trailheads, all potential users can make educated decisions about the
trails they use.

E. Backcountry trail construction standards
1. Backcountry trails should be built to IMBA standards. Surface treatment shall be a natural
surface constructed with a bench width of 2 to 4 feet, which ensures environmental
stewardship and allows for long-term sustainability by:
a. Incorporating bench-cut construction with a tread surface that has an outward
slope to the outer edge from a grade of 2 to 8% in the downhill direction; and
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 31/64
b. Incorporating grade reversals and dips to reduce water erosion; these grades
should average between 5 and 8%, with a maximum grade of no more than 10%,
into the trail design and construction specifications.
Adding these features will help minimize tread erosion by allowing water to drain
in a gentle, non-erosive manner and ensuring the soil stays on the trail where it
belongs.

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 32/64
2. Surface And Width: The original trail cut should be four feet (4") wide. The tread surface
will compact and revegetate leaving a two foot (2') wide usable tread surface. Terrain and
levels of expected use should determine width. The trail surface (tread) must be free of all
organic material. All vegetation debris should be dispersed downhill of the tread and be
noticeable to users. Corridor should be clear of all branches and tree stumps within two
feet (2') of the tread surface. Full bench construction is required (Figure 3).

7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 33/64
3. Grade: Grades should not exceed ten percent (10%). Optimal grades are between five (5)
and eight percent (8%). If grades exceed ten percent (10%), which is only permitted on a
limited basis, consideration must be given to the maintenance issues that may arise and
the sustainability of the trail over time.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 34/64
4. Drainage:
a. Outslope is two percent (2%) to five percent (5%).
b. Rolling grade dips are the preferred water diversion feature (diagram 3).
c. Knicks can also be used. These are sis (6) to ten (10) feet long and have a fifteen
percent (15%) outslope (diagram 4).
d. Swells can be used where drainage is possible.
e. Drain dips cannot be constructed on grades exceeding ten percent (10%).
f. Water bars can be used in rare circumstances where terrain is prohibitive to
above.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 35/64
g. All topsoil removed to create the tread must be sidecast and dispersed.
Figure 4: Rolling Grade Dip
Rolling grade dips are a sustainable alternative to water bars. Dips are large
enough to be self-cleaning and subtle enough that cyclist will not steer around
them. A dip is longer than a bike and shaped like a knick. Use bondable soil from
a dip to make a long, gentle ramp just past it. The ramp should be nearly twice as
long as the dip.
Figure 5: Knick

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 36/64
Kincks are used on gentle terrain to direct sheet flow off the trail. In contrast to
rolling grade dips, soil from the knick is spread downslope off trail. The goal is
sheet flow, not concentrated runoff.
Knicks can be used on contour trails, to accentuate natural grade breaks and
direct water off trails. Knicks should be long and subtle to be self-cleaning, yet
unobtrusive to trail users.

5. Switchbacks and Climbing Turns
Figure 6: Rolling Crown Switchback
This shows the most sustainable type of turn of steep sideslopes. Inslope the trail bed
only on the upper leg as it transitions to the crowned landing. The landing should have a
12 to 18 foot diameter, depending on trail width. The landing is outsloped in all directions.
Build a grade reversal just before the upper leg to move water off the trail before it
reaches the landing.

Maintain constant grade and radius through the tum section. Climbing turns may not be
sustainable on sideslopes exceeding 7 percent grade.
Figure 8: Grade Reversal
A climbing turn is any turn that ascends ( or descends) on the fall line of a sideslope.
Improve sustainability by placing climbing turns on gentle slopes and using grade

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 39/64
reversals to drain water above them. Climbing turns should have a large turning radius
and barriers between legs to prevent shortcutting.
F. Trail Construction
1. Guarantee for Trail Construction. Trail construction that is required as part of a
development project will be subject to a security or bond that covers one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the trail construction cost. This will be required at the same time the
bonding is done for the other infrastructure requirements. All requirements and bonding
will be completed with the Heber City Engineering Department.
2. Trail Easements. All public trails will require a recorded easement. All trail easements
shall be noted and defined on a plat map or by recorded easement. Backcountry trails
and some soft surface trails will be recorded as built, and will be included as an exhibit in
the development agreement when receiving plat approvals from Heber City. Before bonds
for the trails will be release the as-built trail easements must be recorded.
3. Phasing. When trails are part of a phased project, the phasing of various trail segments
will follow a logical sequence for trail users. This phasing and expected dates of
completion for trails shall be noted in the development agreement with Heber City.
4. Measures to Reduce Trail Construction Impacts. As stated previously, a good site
selection for your trail will prevent most construction impacts. Water drainage and erosion
must first be addressed during the trail location phase, allowing for the use of natural
features to be incorporated into the trail design. The following may or may not be required
for trail construction.
a. In ecologically sensitive areas, temporary fencing may be used to protect these
features.
b. Trails located near wetlands, may require boardwalk style construction.
c. If using machinery to cut the trail, the right size equipment must be used. Different
products are available specific to trail construction needs.
d. If building near waterways or critical runoff points, trail layout will need to be
reviewed on a case by case basis. Erosion matting or other device may be
required for construction.
e. In visually sensitive areas, work with hand tools may be necessary to reduce
visual impacts.
f. Indigenous materials should be used to the greatest extent possible for
construction and revegetation practices. Seed mixes should be native; and care
should be taken to not introduce nonnative materials into construction areas.
g. Revegetation should occur quickly after construction dependent on the location,
season and availability of water. Use of a native seed mix will be necessary. Trees
and shrubs will need to be replaced if removed for construction purposes. For
recommended seed mix and native vegetation please contact: Utah State
University Extension Service, Heber City Branch, 55 South 500 East, Heber City,
UT 84032.

G. Trailheads. Trailheads generally provide four essential purposes: signing, off street parking,
restroom facilities and trail access. Any access into the trail system is considered a trailhead.
New development that includes public trails, must consider how the public will get to these
facilities and how it will coordinate with other plans in the development. Trailheads should be
visible, easily accessible and designed to accommodate the type of trail uses allowed.
Equestrian trails will require more space than hiking or biking only trails for trailer parking and
maneuvering.
1. Trailhead Classification. Access to a trail system is one of the primary elements for a
successful trail network. Trailheads serve the local and regional population who access
the trail network by car, transit, bicycle, foot, and/or other modes of travel. These access
points provide essential connections to the system and serve as an information hub to
educate and provide users with directions, maps, rules and regulations of the trails and
area, closures, events, etc. Where appropriate, support facilities, such as resting areas,
interpretive signs specific to the area, public art, restrooms, fountains, and bike racks,
may be provided. To plan proposed trailheads and improve existing ones, the following
classification standard was created. Three different classes are proposed based on
capacity, location, trail access, and amenities.
a. Class 1 Trailheads. Class 1 trailheads are classified as major developed parking
hubs for both community and regional trails where heavy use is anticipated. Class
1 trailheads should include, but are not limited to, a minimum of 25 paved parking
stalls, direct and safe trail access, restrooms, information kiosks, with maps and
educational information, drinking fountains, bike racks, security lighting, public art,
and monument signs, as determined at the time of approval, evaluation, and
development. Class 1 trailheads should address good circulation patterns, site
distances, proper drainage and storm water runoff, and landscaping, as required.
b. Class 2 Trailheads. Class 2 trailheads are classified as trail parking areas that
include less than 25 parking stalls but more than six. Parking surfaces may be
improved with road base, gravel, or pavement. Amenities may include, but are not
limited to, restrooms, map kiosks, signs, safe and direct trail access, and other
items, as determined at the time of approval, evaluation, and development. These
trailheads should address good circulation patterns, site distances, and proper
drainage and storm water runoff, if necessary.

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 41/64
c. Class 3 Trailheads. Class 3 trailheads are classified as small, undeveloped, legal
trail parking areas that provide six or less parking stalls and accommodates offstreet
parking. There are typically no trailhead amenities, such as restrooms, bike
racks, etc. They do provide direct access to trails and often provide a map kiosk
with trail information.

H. Bridges. Bridges can be a great attraction for trail users and most likely highlight a scenic
vantage point. In Heber City, bridges may be used to span rivers, streams, canals, roadways,
and steep topographic features.
Two (2) design types can be used: custom made or a factory built steel truss. Both styles have
advantages and disadvantages and some general recommendations have been made here.
A custom bridge will use treated lumber that is resistant to decay for long-term durability. A
typical custom bridge span is less than twenty (20) to twenty five feet (25). Longer spans for low
bridges can be formed using piers, creating the aesthetically desirable possibility of aligning the
bridge on a curve.
Factory built bridges should be used for clear spans over twenty (20) to twenty five feet (25).
These bridges can be ordered in any length and width, with several competing manufacturers.
Decks can be wooden or concrete and all engineering is done by the manufacturer.
1. General Design Features.
a. Width of bridge should be the equivalent of the trail. This refers to the usable width
of the bridge and does not consider construction requirements.
b. Bridge alignments should allow for adequate sight distances and where possible
be constructed to avoid the need for users to make sharp turns at either end of the
bridge.
c. Railings are required if the decking is farther than thirty inches (30) above the
feature being spanned. Railings should be fifty four inches (54) high, with railings
spaced not greater than fifteen inches (15) (if drop-offs are hazardous, this is
limited to 4 inch spacing).
d. All exposed bolt and screw heads should be countersunk to be flush with the
wood surface.
e. Breakaway design features must be used if the bridge is constructed in an area
prone to flooding.
f. The design must be structurally sound and approved by a licensed engineer.
Design must factor in both live and dead load.
g. Design and materials should fit in with surrounding development.
h. Contact with state of Utah Division of Water Rights, Army Corp of Engineers and
Heber City Engineer may be necessary, depending on location.
I. Fencing. Fencing should be installed only where physical separation is necessary for safety
and/or to preserve adjacent landowner privacy. Fences should not create a narrow corridor effect
for long stretches along the trail. Where possible, fencing should be located only on one side of
the trail at a time.
Fences should be no closer than five feet (5') from the trail edge and must also be located within
the trail easement. Where fences are necessary along both sides of a trail, the minimum width
should be twenty feet (20') as is consistent with the required trail easement.
Gates are required for trails that cross stock grazing areas. Said gates will be a self-closing lever
latch type.

J. Signing. The signing standards include three (3) types: informational, regulatory and interpretive.
All types should be straightforward and simple to read and understand.
1. Informational Signs at Trailheads. These signs are primarily located at trailheads or areas
where the user may experience a change in the trail experience. These signs should be
located in such a way as to not interfere with the trail surface but be accessible to the
users.
2. Interpretive Signs. These signs benefit the users by explaining some feature available on
the trail route. The features may include historical, biological, natural resources, or
cultural facts about an area. Often these signs are educational and will serve to relay
management goals of an area. These must be located in appropriate areas.
3. Regulatory Signs. The following are some of the signs likely to be needed, along with
their identification number and size. Some unusual signs may have to be custom made.
These examples are taken from the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices",
December 2000 edition (MUTCD). The MUTCD should be referenced for complete
signing standards.
4. Stop and Yield Warnings.
a. "Stop" signs are intended for use where bicyclists are required to stop.
b. "Yield" signs shall be installed on shared use paths at points where bicyclists have
an adequate view of conflicting traffic as they approach the sign and where
bicyclists are required to yield to the right of way. The visibility of approaching
traffic must be adequate to permit the bicyclist to stop or take other measures to
avoid that traffic.
c. "Stop Ahead" and "Yield Ahead" signs should be used where an intersection
cannot be seen on approach. They may also be used to emphasize the right of
way at busy or dangerous intersections.
d. "Driveway Crossing" should be used where a driveway crossing cannot be seen
on approach. This sign can also emphasize busy or potentially dangerous
driveway crossings.
5. Unexpected or Hazardous Conditions Warnings. These should be used only when
necessary to warn of unexpected or potentially hazardous conditions. The signs should

6. Turn and Curve Warnings. If the trail changes direction unexpectedly and the change is
not readily apparent on approach, use appropriate tum or curve signs to warn bicyclists.
They should normally be installed no less than fifty feet (50') in advance of the beginning
of change of alignment.

7. Sign Construction Features (Sample Bollards and Mile Markers).
a. Sign Posts: There are many design solutions to signage along a trail; below is one
commonly used design. Post location will conform to the standards set forth in the
MUTCD section on "Traffic Control Devices for Bicycle Facilities". Signposts will
be four by four (4 x 4) pressure treated Douglas fir, embedded into the ground a
minimum of twenty four inches (24") unless other materials are specifically
approved. Attachment Systems: Signs should be attached to wood posts with
three-eighths inch (3/8") diameter galvanized carriage bolts in a minimum of two
(2) locations per post.
b. Sign Bollards: These should be located at all trail access points. Posts should be
constructed of Redwood or pressure treated Douglas fir. The individual symbols
are three inches (3") square reflective decals that can be ordered from Carsonite
International. They should be mounted on heavy gauge aluminum plate routed
into the post a minimum of two inches (2") and epoxied into place.

K. Crossings and Roadway Interface. Heber City and the Heber Valley are dissected by US-189
and US-40, regional highways which connect the County to the Wasatch Front and the Uintah
Basin. These highways carry a significant volume of semi-trucks, which makes crossing these
roads a challenge. To improve trail connectivity between communities within the valley, three
types of crossings, at-grade, elevated, or underpass, will need to be considered for each location
(see Figure 3). Construction type will be based on the average daily trips (ADT) projected at build
out.
1. At-Grade Crossings. Of the three crossing options, building an at-grade crossing may be
the least expensive. Several multi-use trails in the urban area of the Wasatch Front cross
major collectors that carry high volumes of traffic. These crossings may be a cost
effective solution since they can be used at signalized intersections within downtown
Heber City where speeds are lower.
2. Trail Overpasses. When trails need to cross higher speed roadways, grade separation is
required for safety. A trail bride over US-189 or on US-40 north or south of the Heber City
limits would be recommended as it will allow for trail users to cross safely. Trail bridges
can be expensive (typically exceeding $1 million) as additional property is needed to build
the ramps and meet height requirements.

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=17_Subdivisions 48/64
3. Trail Underpasses. Building a tunnel or underpass is another solution to safely separate
trails from high volume/high speed roadways. Depending on the number of underground
utilities, the level of groundwater in the area, and soil types, an underpass can be a cost
effective solution for the proposed trail crossing on US-40 and US-189. These
underpasses will require lighting for safety.

All applications for commercial development approval are required to follow the submission, review, and
approval process found in Chapter 17.16 and Chapter 17.20 herein, even in the circumstance where no
subdivision is created by the development proposal, except that commercial projects are not required to
submit a Preliminary Plan. Commercial Development shall mean any nonresidential development
building greater than 1,000 total square feet, including but not limited to public, commercial, industrial
and non-profit organization buildings or facilities. Exception: public buildings under 1,000 square feet are
exempt. Each commercial project will be required to submit a Concept Plan and a Final Plat. This
requirement is intended to provide adequate project review in a manner consistent with other Heber City
review processes.
The Concept Plan for a commercial development should include sufficient information about the project
to allow the Planning Commission to complete a thorough review of the proposed project. Because the
nature of each commercial project is different, consultation with planning staff will help each applicant to
prepare the Concept Plan. If properly completed, the Concept Plan may be used as the Final Plat for a
commercial project.
Exception to this Subdivision Ordinance for commercial development are limited to the following:
A. More than one structure may be placed on a commercial parcel if the setback and all other
requirements are satisfied.
B. The owner of commercial property does not need to provide a name for the commercial
development.
C. Other requirements, which can be clearly demonstrated by the applicant, which are not
applicable to commercial development.
In addition to the requirements listed above, all commercial developments within Heber City are
subject to Chapter 17.14 Adequate Public Facilities, herein.
Each commercial development shall satisfy all applicable requirements of this Subdivision
Ordinance, also known as Title 17 of the Heber City Code, and the Heber City Zoning Ordinance,
also known as Title 18 of the Heber City Code.
As with all Ordinances of Heber City, if this Chapter is found to be in conflict with any other Heber
City Ordinance or Resolution, the stricter of the two shall apply. Likewise, if any portion of this
Chapter is found to be unlawful or invalid by a court of law, that section alone shall be removed
and the remaining sections of this Chapter shall remain in effect.
D. Commercial Concept Approval becomes null and void if not acted upon within six (6) months of
its approval, and Commercial Final Approval becomes null and void if not acted upon within one
year of its approval. Either Concept or Final Approvals may receive one extension upon
written permission by the Planning Commission. The duration of the extension for Concept
Approval shall not exceed six (6) months. The duration of the extension for Final Approval shall
not exceed twelve (12) months.

following requirements.
All setback areas adjacent to a public street shall be fully landscaped and properly maintained. Trees
shall be planted at no less than twenty (20) feet on center, on average, and shall have no less than
a two (2) inch caliper, except that no trees shall be planted within forty-five (45) feet of an
intersection clear view area. Trees may be planted in clusters to create a more natural and/or screening
effect, if appropriate.
All ground areas shall contain grass, or another ground cover acceptable to the Planning Commission,
and shall be irrigated sufficiently. Shrubs, flower beds, decorative rocks, and other appropriate
landscaping is highly encouraged.
All landscaped areas shall be maintained using a sprinkling and/or irrigation system which is capable of
being engaged automatically on a regular basis. Each applicant for commercial development shall
submit a complete and detailed landscaping plan for review by the Planning Commission concurrently
with submission of other documents for review by the Planning Commission.
All landscaped areas shall be maintained on a regular basis and be kept neat and clean. If the Zoning
Administrator determines the maintenance requirement has not been satisfied, the Zoning Administrator
shall notify the property owner. The Zoning Administrator will detail the lack of maintenance and inform
the owner that a continued lack of maintenance will warrant issuance of a Class C misdemeanor charge

shall be stored in an open area.
B. TRASH COLLECTION AREAS. All trash collection areas shall be designed to be compatible with
the proposed project.
C. LIMITED ACCESS. Generally speaking, commercial zones in Heber City are located in areas
with a higher potential for traffic congestion. Therefore, access to commercial developments
shall be limited to the extent possible in order to maintain traffic flow. Access should be
addressed in an appropriate manner in accordance with section 17.38.030 herein.
D. COMPATIBILITY. The Planning Commission may make recommendations to the applicant in
order to improve compatibility with surrounding development. This requirement is intended to
ensure future compatibility with the subject proposal as well, and should be viewed in that
manner by each applicant. If changes to the anticipated structure are made, these changes
should be submitted to the Zoning Administrator at the earliest possible date. The Zoning
Administrator will determine whether the changes need to be reviewed by the Planning
Commission.
E. ADOPTION OF DESIGN CRITERIA. The March 2006 Heber City Design Compatibility Criteria
for Commercial Development in the "Historic" Commercial C-3 Zone, attached as Exhibit A, is

B. STORAGE and WAREHOUSE DEVELOPMENTS. All storage doors, entrances into storage and
warehousing areas, and parking in storage and warehouse developments shall be
internally located and not located on a public street. Internal streets should be constructed at a
width sufficient to allow movement of all anticipated vehicles, including fire and other emergency
vehicles. Each development of this type shall be reviewed by the Heber City Fire Marshall and
must meet this requirement, as evidenced by a letter from the Fire Marshall. It is the
responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that adequate traffic flow can be accomplished.
Heber City acknowledges the need for adequate security in these types of
developments. However, provisions should be made which allow authorized access for public
safety employees into these developments for public and personal safety. This includes access
to entrance codes, electronic opening devices, lock combinations, and the like.
All storage and warehouse developments shall be fenced in a manner which will provide
adequate security and a deterrent from public access. These fences should be kept in good
repair. Fencing other than chain link which is similar in design to other structures within the
development is highly desirable. The rear sides of buildings which provide adequate security may
satisfy this requirement.
C. DENSITY INCENTIVES. Storage and warehouse developments which provide design features
that enhance the aesthetic appearance of the project are entitled to consideration of an increase
in the density of the project. Density incentives shall be as follows:
1. Developments which provide fencing that is not chain link and use materials compatible
with the materials and colors used in the construction of the structures within
the development, or are constructed from wood or other attractive material, as determined
by the Planning Commission, are entitled to a ten (10) percent increase in total project
density. The rear sides of buildings which provide adequate security may be used for this
purpose.
2. Developments which provide multi-pitched roof lines through the use of dormers and
gables, or the like, whether real or false facade shall be entitled to a ten (10) percent
increase in total project density. In order to qualify for a density bonus under this
paragraph, the structure must contain a break in pitch, which is roughly perpendicular to
the roof line, at intervals of not more than forty (40) lineal feet of vertical roof line.
3. Developments which use natural materials and colors such as brick (not intended to be
defined as cinder block), wood siding, stucco, or other attractive materials as found
acceptable to the Planning Commission in the construction of all structure(s) in the
commercial development which face onto public streets shall be entitled to a ten (10)
percent increase in total project density. These incentives are provided in order to
encourage a higher standard of development. If the Planning Commission determines
that a project is not enhanced positively through the efforts of a developer to obtain a
density incentive, the Planning Commission may reduce the percentage, or deny
the increase in total project density.
Each of the incentives are exclusive of the other. Therefore, an applicant my receive a total of
thirty (30) percent increased project density.

17.38.080 Supplementary Requirements
Each of the following requirements are supplementary to this part. They constitute requirements for
Chapter 17.38 only and are adopted under Chapter 17.06 of this Title. Each of these supplementary
requirements must be satisfied prior to approval of an application for commercial development.
A. LAYOUT OF BUILDINGS. Unlike other developments approved under this Title, commercial
developments may have more than one main structure per parcel. In such cases the
applicant shall provide a project master plan to the Planning Commission indicating the location
and size of each proposed structure. Additionally, the project master plan shall indicate
accessory buildings, if any. Each structure in the commercial development is required to satisfy
the building permit requirements of Title 18.12.
B. SETBACKS. Setback requirements in commercial zones may be flexible, but must be approved
by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall consider impacts on
adjacent parcels, traffic, pedestrian access, landscaping and other relevant issues when
recommending setback requirements.
C. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. Surface water from roof tops, parking lots or irrigation ditches
shall not be allowed to drain onto adjacent lots or streets except after written agreement between
the parties involved.
D. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. Whenever a front or side yard is required for a building which abuts
on a proposed street which has not been constructed but which has been designated by
the Planning Commission as a future street, the depth of such front or side yard shall be
measured from the planned street lines.
E. CONCESSIONS. Concessions, including but not limited to amusement devices, recreational
buildings or refreshment stands, shall be required to obtain approval from the
Planning Commission and purchase a business license prior to operating such a business on
any commercial site. Such operations may be denied by the Planning Commission if deemed
inappropriate due to location, hazard, appearance, etc.
F. SOLID WASTE AND SEWAGE. Each commercial development shall be reviewed by the Solid
Waste Department for recommenced solid waste disposal. Where domestic sewage
disposal facilities are used which are not connected to a public sewer, approval of such facilities
shall be obtained from the Health Department before a building permit is issued.

18.12.120 Board Of Adjustment -- Powers And Duties
The board of adjustment shall have judicial power to interpret the provisions of this title. It shall also have
administrative duties to grant variances and special exceptions or conditional use permits as follows:
A. Interpretation of Ordinance and Map.
1. Intent. It is the intent of this provision to provide a way whereby applicants who think that
the zoning administrator is in error or does or does not interpret the provisions of this
title correctly to obtain a relief from such error in an expeditious and inexpensive manner
without having to resort to the courts;
2. Duty to Interpret. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal
made in the enforcement of this title. The board of adjustment shall also interpret the zone
map and boundaries thereof in cases of dispute or disagreement;
B. Granting of Variances. The board of adjustments may authorize, upon appeal, variances upon
the terms of this title pertaining to area and width of lot, size of yards, height and size of
buildings, alterations, increases and expansions of nonconforming buildings in conforming zones,
wherein owing to special conditions peculiar to the property a literal enforcement of the provision
of this title would result in hardships which are unnecessary to carry out the intention of this title.
Before any variance is granted, however, there must be shown:
1. The variance will not substantially effect the comprehensive plan of the zone
and adherence to the strict letter of this title will cause difficulty and hardship upon the
petitioner which are unnecessary to carry out the intention of the this title;
2. Except in granting expansions, alterations or increases to nonconforming buildings the
property covered by the application would otherwise be deprived of privileges possessed
by other property in the same zone; and that the granting of the variance is essential to
the enjoyment of the property right possessed by other property in the same zone;
3. That the difficulty and hardships were not created by any act of the appellant subsequent
to the effective date of the regulations appealed from;
4. That any expansion or increase of a nonconforming building shall not diminish the front
setback beyond that of the existing nonconforming building.

C. Granting of Certain Special Exceptions or Conditional Uses:
1. Intent. There are certain uses which are not permitted within particular zones unless they
are made to comply with conditions which make them compatible with other uses in the
same zone. Accordingly, the board of adjustment shall hear and decide requests for
special exceptions or conditional uses, but only when authorized to do so;
2. In deciding whether or not to grant a special exception or conditional use, the board shall
be guided by stipulations applicable thereto, which shall be deemed to be the minimum
that must be complied with;
a. Transitional Uses. Uses which are permitted on either portion of the lot, which lot
is divided by a zone boundary line or which is coterminous with a zone boundary
line, may be permitted to extend to the entire lot, but not more than one hundred
feet beyond the boundary line of such zone in which such use is permitted. Before
a permit for such use is granted, however, the board of adjustment must find that
the comprehensive plan of zoning will be maintained and that a more harmonious
mixing of uses will be achieved thereby.
D. Adjustment or Reduction of Off-street Parking Requirements. The board of adjustment may
approve substitute parking locations and may reduce the amount of off-street parking
required provided:
1. It can be shown that the time of use of the buildings or uses will be at different hours or
days so that each use will have the amount of off-street parking available when the
building or use is occupied; or
2. Sufficient off-street parking is readily available within the vicinity; or
3. Where acquisition of land for such use is unnecessary in order to carry out the purposes
of this title;4. The board of adjustment has the authority to grant a variance to the
required number of off-street parking spaces in the C3 central commercial zone under the
following conditions:
a. When the variance is needed, in the opinion of the board, to maintain the utility of
the structures in the central commercial district, and
b. When there is not available to the structure on the site, an area for the required
number of off-street parking spaces, and
c. When the required number of off-street parking spaces or ground for the parking
spaces have not been split off the site, since the date of the amendment codified
in this subsection.
E. Attachment of Reasonable Conditions. The board of adjustment may attach
reasonable conditions or requirements to the grant of a variance, special exception, or
conditional use which the petitioner must comply with as a condition of the grant or approval. A
time limit of one year shall be attached to the exercise or non-exercise of any grant or approval,
unless specifically extended by the action of the board.
F. Reversal or Affirmation of Zoning Administrator. In performing the duties and powers as set forth
in this title the board of adjustment is empowered to reverse or affirm wholly or partly or
modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination of the enforcing officer and may make
such order or requirement as ought to be made; provided, however, that in interpreting and
applying the provisions of this title, the requirements contained in this title shall be deemed to be
the minimum requirements for the purpose set forth.

The intent of this section is to provide regulations that will further the objectives of the General Plan
relating to residential developments. It is the intent to achieve an excellent balance between open space
and clustering of buildings, harmony between new development and the surrounding area, longer life
expectancy for buildings, superior maintenance and appearance of the landscaping and building and an
overall project open space atmosphere that concurs with goals for a more attractive City.
These regulations are intended to create residential development which offers a better living
environment with open space, trails, amenities (with no fences) and maintenance of all the grounds
which provides enhanced value to the surrounding community. Upon approval of a Clustered Open

B. Concept Plan. The purpose of the Concept Plan Review is to explore general feasibility early in
the planning process. The intent of requiring a Concept Plan is to help avoid unnecessary
and costly delays when pivotal information or necessary resources are not available because
they were not addressed until later in the process. The Concept Plan procedure does not insure
or provide approval of the development. It is however an important preparation, review and
educational component of the overall approval process. While more flexible in nature than the
subsequent steps of Preliminary and Final Approvals, the Concept Plan still needs to be carefully
prepared and thoroughly reviewed to be useful. As part of the Concept Plan, the developer shall
submit:
1. An application for development.
2. A written description of how the development will comply with and promote Heber Citys
Vision and Clustered Open Space Zone.
3. A description of the type of development and project name.
4. A plan which shows a simple concept of the major features of the development including
roads in relation to existing conditions and developments within one-fourth (1/4) of a mile
of the outside boundaries of the development. Handwritten plans will not be accepted.
The Concept Plan shall be submitted on two (2) full-size, 24 x 36 copies, and twenty
(20) 11"x 17" copies of the Concept Plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.
5. Title ownership information and a current Preliminary Title Report. If the applicant is not
the owner listed on the Preliminary Title report a written consent to the application
signed by the title holder must be provided.
6. Lot or unit pattern and size(s).
7. Number of lots or units and conformance with the zone.
8. The types of buildings in the project by use and the architectural elevations and style.
9. Any plans for common area.
10. Any plans for common amenities.
11. Any public dedication proposals.
12. Conceptual Landscape Plan.
13. Any open space provisions including the following information:
a. Location.
b. General size. (Meeting a 50% minimum open space requirement)
c. Description of how the open space plan conforms to the standards for open
space.
d. Any off-site open space trading provisions as allowed by this Ordinance shall be
taken to the City Council for approval before applying for preliminary plan
approval.

a. Topographic information related to such issues involving the project.
b. Information to identify potential sensitive land issues and a plan for how to
address these issues.

sheets and twenty (20) copies of the plan on 11 X 17 size paper to the Planning Commission
for its recommendation to the City Council. The purpose of the Preliminary Plan is to
demonstrate how the proposed development plan will be able to meet the standards required
under the Zoning Ordinance and other applicable law or regulation after considering the issues
and recommendations found during the concept review phase. While the preliminary plan is not
expected to contain construction drawings, it is expected that the preliminary plan will
demonstrate compliance with this code. The preliminary plan shall contain the following
information (if any of the following information is satisfied by the information submitted during the
concept plan review, that same information must be included again with the preliminary plan):
1. Description of how the development will implement Heber Citys Vision.

where the cultivation of crops and the raising and keeping of livestock and related uses can
be carried on and where such uses can be protected and encouraged. While dwellings and
certain other uses not related to agriculture are permitted, such development is not encouraged
in the A-2 agricultural zone because of the conflict which occurs between farm and non-farm
uses. For this reason, owners or developers of land should bear in mind that primacy is given in
this zone to agriculture and livestock raising and any development should be undertaken in
recognition thereof.
B. The A-2 agriculture zone is characterized by dwellings situated on large lots and tracts of land
which are devoted to the growing of crops and the pasturing and care and keeping of animals
and fowl. Caretaker or owner occupied dwellings situated on the large lots and tracts of land are
also characteristic of this zone.

18.42.040 Site Design
A. Relationship to Street. The Streetscape within the MURCZ shall resemble the Streetwall
found in the Downtown C-3 Zone and promote a pedestrian anchored shopping experience, but
at the same time shall recognize the vehicular presence within the MURCZ.
1. Buildings shall be designed to accommodate both the street pedestrian and the parking
lot pedestrian into the facility. Buildings shall be designed with an entrance that is visible
from the street. The street front of all buildings shall be designed to visually invite the
pedestrian into the facility and shall create an anchor to the streetscape. Large buildings
and large expanses of parking lots shall be buffered along public streets with smaller
tenant pads, landscaping, sidewalks and other amenities acceptable to the Planning
Department.
B. Building Setbacks.
1. In the Mixed-Use Residential Commercial Zone, there shall be no area and width
requirements. All commercial, service buildings and structures, gasoline pumps, and all
buildings and structures shall be setback at least ten feet from any public street property
line.
2. Residential buildings which have parking areas accessed from the rear of the building
shall have minimum front street and side street property line setbacks of at least 10 feet,
as measured from any public street property line, as long as the street meets the adopted
street standard width for a public street. All other residential buildings shall be located at
least 30 feet from any public street property line, unless a larger setback is required
elsewhere in this Chapter. Buildings located in Residential Transition areas shall be
subject to the setbacks as specified in Section 18.42.100.
C. Building Orientation. All primary facades and design elements shall orient to a public street or
main drive isles with secondary and subordinate features associated with side streets and
alleyways. Placement of building(s) on a site shall be compatible with existing buildings in order
to maintain the building setback. Primary building entrances shall be oriented towards a public
street or main drive isles with a secondary entrance off of the parking area. Joint angular
entrances that service both the parking and public street pedestrian traffic are permitted.
D. Sensitivity to Natural Features. All buildings in the MURCZ shall appear harmonious and be
compatible with the Heber Valley mountain environment. Natural features shall be preserved and
protected and used and preserved as key elements in the site placement of buildings. Sensitivity
to these natural features, as well as view corridors, shall be considered during site placement
and concept approval. Specific examples include site and building design with sensitivity to view
corridors such as the preservation of views of Mount Timpanogos and the Wasatch Mountains,
historic markers or buildings, open space, etc., as well as other places of interest as viewed from
the street, and adjoining properties, and preservation of large existing trees or other unique
cultural or natural features on the property.

E. Residential Compatibility.Commercial development which adjoins a residential zone or a
residential use, or is across the street from a residential zone or use shall adhere to the following
to minimize the impact of the commercial use on the residences:
1. Loading zones, loading docks and utilities which create noise and vibration such as air
conditioners, garbage bins, and other nuisance creating objects shall be setback from the
residential property lines by at least fifteen feet (15).
2. Commercial uses adjoining existing residential uses shall be bounded with a six foot (6)
sight-obscuring fence of like materials and design of the building façade, and a ten foot
(10) landscaped area planted with dense evergreen shrubbery and/or evergreen trees
along the residential lotlines.
3. Rooftop utilities and antenna equipment shall be screened with parapet walls.
4. Uses which emit noise, radiation, fumes, smoke, vapors or other deleterious effects shall
be separated from existing residences by placing them as far away from the residences
as reasonably possible on the lot and preferably separated from the residences by
another less intrusive commercial building or use.
5. No dust, odors, smoke, vibrations or intermittent light, glare or noise shall be emitted
which arediscernible beyond the premises except for normal traffic movements.

18.42.050 Building Design
A. Design Vision Statement. The building design of structures in this Zone shall complement the
Downtown C-3 Zone, and draw upon the historic architectural heritage of Heber City. This design
vision shall draw upon the past materials, techniques, form, mass and details of the Downtown
C-3 Zone while allowing the architect to create a current interpretation of the space and its
aesthetic and functional needs.
B. Architectural Unity. All buildings on the same site shall be architecturally unified. This provision
shall apply to new construction, additions and remodeling. Architectural unity means that
buildings shall be related in architectural style, color scheme and building materials. All
accessory buildings and enclosures shall be designed to be compatible with the primary
structure. The Planning Commission and City Council shall determine compatibility, which shall
be measured in terms of design, form, use of materials and color.
C. Design Composition. The design composition of Heber City shall reflect the authentic design
elements which come from the surrounding environment and the historic, social and cultural
features that carry the spirit of a special place and provide a link between the founders of Heber
City, those who live here today, as well as those in the future who will choose to call Heber
Cityhome.
D. Physical Characteristics. All design elements shall be harmonious to the more dominating
Downtown C-3 Zone but shall be subordinate in terms of all physical characteristics. Common
threads of color, materials, textures and details shall play an integral part of design in the
MURCZ Zone, leading into the C-2, C-3, and C-4 Zones.
E. Floor Area Limitation. No building shall exceed 150,000 gross square feet, unless authorized by
the City Council.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 58/336
F. Building Floor Usage. Appropriate building floor usage shall be defined as follows. First floor
uses shall be reserved for all retail, business, or professional services as allowed by the Heber
City ordinances appropriate for this Zone. Second floor uses shall have the option of all first floor
uses or residential mixed uses as reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission. Within
the residential portion of the project, residential uses may be placed on the first floor.
G. Building Height. All buildings shall maintain the average perceived scale of two story buildings at
the sidewalk. The average height can vary by way of architectural styles but shall maintain the
average façade height within established architectural proportions of height to width ratio.
Commercial buildings shall not exceed 45 feet in height, measured from finished grade to the
highest point of the building. Buildings with a residential component shall not exceed 50 feet in
height, measured from finished grade to the highest point of the building. Clock towers,
cupolas,entry areas and other special architectural features that visually break up the building
form may, upon approval from the Heber City Planning Commission, exceed the specified
building height.
H. Building Width.Commercial Buildings within this zone shall maintain a resemblance of the street
wall found within the C-3 zone, but allow for interior vehicular penetration from the street
accessing side and rear yard parking. Placing the façade of the building back from the front
property line allows for the placement of more landscape material as well as pedestrian friendly
features to encourage pedestrian activity. The following standards are intended to reduce the
massive scale of large buildings which, without application of these standards, would be
incompatible with the Citys desired character.
No uninterrupted length of any wall shall exceed 75 horizontal feet without employing the use of
architectural features including, but not limited to doors, windows, pilasters, columns, horizontal
and vertical offsets, materials, colors and textural variations, decorative cornices, awnings,
arcades, entry areas, canopies, murals, graphics, reveals, projection ribs and offsets. In order to
assure conformance with this requirement, all exterior elevations shall be reviewed and approved
as a part of the overall review process.
I. Building Form.One of the most prominent unifying elements of the traditional Main Street is the
similarity in building form. Commercial buildings were simple rectangular solids, deeper than they
were wide. The pedestrian levels were more decorative in appearance with a vertical extension
in height and an expansion of glazing surface area. The upper levels were shorter in floor-to-floor
height and displayed a more conservative treatment of architectural elements. This characteristic
is important and shall be maintained in new projects.
1. Rectangular forms shall be dominant on Main Street facades and shall be vertically
oriented. The facade shall appear predominantly flat, with decorative elements and
articulations to be subordinate to the prevailing form.
J. Building Mass. A building shall have a mass that is similar to that of traditional buildings in Heber
City. A buildings mass is defined in broad form or generalized shapes rather than in specific
details. A building shall appear similar in scale to that seen traditionally for similar building types.
Reduction of the apparent mass of a building shall be accomplished through use of a
combination of the following design methods:
1. Provide variation in the wall plane.
2. Design a façade of smaller buildings into the larger structure.
3. Provide variation in exterior material, color and texture selection.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 59/336
K. Human Scale. A building shall appear to have a human scale that relates to the pedestrian
patron. In general, this can be accomplished by using familiar forms and elements that can be
interpreted in human dimensions. All buildings shall have a human scale that is relative to the
adjacent buildings and relevant to the pedestrian streetscape. Building design shall avoid large
panelized products and extensive featureless surfaces. Buildings shall establish and reinforce
the area as a pedestrian environment, and utilize the following architectural features:
1. Brick or stone in standard modules or scaled to the appropriate size.

7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 69/336
Vacant buildings encompassing a substantial square footage require more intensive municipal services,
including, but not limited to fire/police protection, community development, and code enforcement. All
developments which contain buildings 60,000 square feet or larger shall enter into a vacancy,
development and maintenance agreement between the property/building owner and Heber City.
A. Dark Store/Vacancy Agreement.Because developments in this Zone tend to be a gateway to the
City, and have significant impact on the community as a whole as well as the accompanying
retail, commercial and retail entities and locations within and surrounding such developments,
should these developments or buildings be vacated, the impact on the City would be substantial
and dramatic. Therefore owners of such developments and buildings shall specifically, in addition
to any other requirements within this Chapter and Title 18, be subject to and adhere to the
following.
1. A commercial building permit application shall not be approved for the construction of a
large retail establishment over 60,000 square feet until a Vacancy Agreement has been
approved by the Planning Commission and City Council. The Vacancy Agreement shall
be signed by the City and the developer and will apply to all future owners, lessees, and
lessors of the site and/or building. The agreement shall contain the following requirements
in this Section a, and Section b below:
a. The property owner shall have the first right of refusal as set forth in a recorded
agreement, to redevelop the building and re-market the property after one year of
vacancy. However, owner shall only have one year from owners election of such
a right to secure such redevelopment or remarket the building.
b. No agreement associated with the proposed property, premises and structures
shall contain non-compete clauses or other such language that would allow a
former occupant of a vacated building to prohibit or limit the occupancy and use of
the building and site or redevelopment or reuse of the building and site which the
former occupant has vacated. However, such language may be used to restrict
competition among occupants within a proposed property.
c. In the event that the facility is vacated, the owner, within twelve months of vacancy
shall submit to the Planning Commission and City Council a plan for the reuse of
the facility. The time limit may be extended by the City Council. If unable to
provide a plan which is acceptable to the City, the City may utilize a
Redevelopment Agency or other mechanism to take whatever action is permitted
by law or this Chapter to assure appropriate redevelopment, reuse or demolition of
the property and facility.
d. A development agreement provision citing conditions of approval and other
reasonable agreements as necessary to minimize the negative impact of a
potential dark store.

2. Said proposed plan and agreement shall include provisions that require the owner to
reimburse the City any costs incurred by the City for fully and completely maintaining a
building for any period of vacancy after a 90-day vacancy grace period for a building
greater than 60,000 square feet, in the event the Owner does not so maintain. .
3. A cash bond shall be posted prior to issuance of a building permit that will cover
maintenance or redevelopment of the site in the event of the owner failing to do so. The
amount will be determined by the Planning Commission and City Council, but will in no
event initially exceed $5,000.00 monthly, and thereafter any increases shall not exceed
the Consumer Price Index guidelines.
4. A building shall not be permitted to be dark for a period longer than 2 years. In the event
of a store being dark, the City may, but not be limited to, utilize a Redevelopment Agency
or other mechanism to take whatever action is permitted by law, the provisions of this
Title, or the provisions of the development and maintenance agreement to assure
appropriate redevelopment or reuse of the facility.
5. In the event that a building is vacant for a period longer than three months, the record
owner shall re-rent, re-lease or resell the building and the property surrounding said
building, using all commercially reasonable measures and efforts available. Owner shall
maintain said building pursuant to the requirements of the development and maintenance
agreement abovereferenced as if the building and property were occupied and open for
business.

C. Enforcement and Remedies.In the event that a building is vacant for a period longer than three
months, the City shall, in addition to all other remedies available or permitted by ordinance,
statute, or the requirements of any development and maintenance agreement associated with
said building or property, have the option of the following remedies:
1. If the Zoning Administrator, or his or her designee, determines that any provision of this
Chapter is being violated and immediate enforcement action is not necessary under the
circumstances, the Zoning Administrator shall provide a written notice of violation to the
property owner or any other person determined to be responsible for the violation. Such
written notice of violation shall indicate the nature of the violation, the action necessary to
correct the violation, the warning period established before further enforcement action or
penalties, and the potential enforcement action and/or penalties to be imposed for failure
to cure the violation within the established warning period. Such notice of violation shall
serve to start the warning period.
2. Unless otherwise determined by the Zoning Administrator, the warning period for
correction of violations set forth in the notice of violation shall be ten (10) days from the
receipt of the notice of violation. If the violation remains uncured after expiration of the
warning period, the Zoning Administrator shall pursue further enforcement action as
deemed appropriate in accordance with the provisions provided herein. The Zoning
Administrator is authorized, in his or her discretion, to extend the warning period, not to
exceed thirty(30) days, if the Zoning Administrator determines good cause exists for such
extended warning period and the extension will not create or perpetuate a situation
imminently dangerous to life or property. Any such extension shall require written
agreement by the property owner or person responsible for the violation to remedy the
violations within a set time frame and to comply with any and all conditions of extension
as required by the Zoning Administrator. A request for extension shall be filed in writing by
the property owner or person responsible for the violation prior to the expiration of the ten
(10) day response period. In the case of a violation involving either continuing
construction or development, or an emergency situation, as reasonably determined by the
Zoning Administrator, the City may use the enforcement powers and remedies available
to it under this Chapter, or the remedies contained in Chapter 18. of the Heber City Code,
without prior notice or notice of violation, in such case, the Zoning Administrator shall
send the notice to the same parties simultaneously with the beginning of enforcement
action.
3. Any building or structure set up, erected, constructed, altered, enlarged, converted,
moved, or maintained; or any land, building, or premises used contrary to the provisions
of this Chapter is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. The City
Attorney, Prosecutor or other authorized legal counsel may commence action or
proceedings for the abatement, removal, and enjoinment thereof in the manner provided
by law. The City Attorney, Prosecutor or other authorized legal counsel may also take
such other steps and may apply to such court as may have jurisdiction to grant such relief
as will abate and remove such building or structure, and restrain and enjoin any person,
firm, or corporation from setting up, erecting, building, maintaining, or using any building,
structure, or property contrary to the provisions of this Chapter.
4. If any violation of this Chapter remains uncured after issuance of a notice of violation and
expiration of the warning period, a citation of civil penalties may, in addition to any other
applicable remedies associated with this Chapter or those available pursuant to the City
Code, be issued to the property owner or other person determined to be responsible for

with the civil penalties fee schedule adopted by the City. Penalties shall be provided on a
graduated scale providing for the first and recurring violations. If a violation is corrected
but reoccurs on the same property within one year from the imposition of any civil penalty,
any subsequent violation within such one year period shall subject the person to the
recurring violation penalty. Civil penalties may not be imposed for a civil violation that
occurs in conjunction with another criminal violation as part of a single criminal episode
that will be prosecuted in a criminal proceeding.
6. Any person having received a citation of civil penalties may request a hearing before a
hearing officer by filing a written application for hearing. Such request for hearing shall be
filed prior to the due date for thecivil penalties. The hearing shall be held in accordance

be referenced for additional information. In the event of a dimensional conflict between the AOZ and the
ALP, the ALP shall apply.
A. Approach Surface (A.S). A surface longitudinally centered on the runway centerline and
extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. The inner edge of the
approach surface is the same width as the primary surface at 500 feet and expands uniformly to
a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet at a slope of 20:1. There are 6
Approach Surface Zones:
1. Eastern Inner Approach Surface Zone. This area includes the first 650 horizontal feet
beyond the Eastern RPZ.
2. Eastern Middle Approach Surface Zone. This area includes the 1,150 horizontal feet
beyond the Eastern Inner Approach Surface Zone.

has two RPZs, with the westernmost RPZ commonly referred to as Western RPZ and the
easternmost as the Eastern RPZ.
I. Transitional Surface. These surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway
centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the primary
surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces up to the Horizontal Surface.
J. Water Impoundment. Areas constructed or intended to contain water such as wastewater
treatment settling ponds, surface mining ponds, detention and retention ponds, artificial lakes
and ponds, and similar water features.

7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 75/336
This Chapter establishes the Airport Overlay Zone (AOZ), consisting of the following height and land use
Surfaces defined in this chapter, and illustrated on the official Heber City Zoning Map:
A. Approach Surface. There are 6 approach surface zones:
1. Eastern Inner Approach Surface Zone.
2. Eastern Middle Approach Surface Zone.
3. Eastern Outer Approach Surface Zone.
4. Eastern Approach Surface Exclusion Zone.
5. Western Inner Approach Surface Zone.
6. Western Outer Approach Surface Zone;
B. Horizontal Surface;
C. Runway Protection Zone (RPZ); and
D. Transitional Surface.
18.43.040 Relationship Of AOZ To Zoning Ordinance
The AOZ is a set of overlay Surfaces that overlay existing zoning districts with additional land use
restrictions to the underlying zoning districts. In the event of a conflict between the AOZ and other
portions of the Heber City Zoning Ordinance, the most restrictive provisions shall apply.
Developers should be aware, not as a condition of this AOZ, but as a condition of 14 CFR Part 77,
development near the airport requires proper notification to the FAA prior to the start of any construction.
The City will not verify the notification, but if a condition becomes known where there are detrimental
impacts to the airport or public safety by the development, the developer shall be wholly responsible for
becoming compliant with this AOZ or other requirements up to and including removing the hazard.
Submitting proof of notification and a FAA Determination of No Hazard may help show compliance with
the intent of safety and public protection of the AOZ during the development process.
18.43.050 Height Limits
A. General Height Restrictions. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the
most restrictive height limitation shall apply. The height limits within each Surface shall be as
follows:
1. RPZ. No building, structure or utility line shall be erected and no tree or other natural
feature shall be permitted to grow or develop above the ground surface, except as
follows:
a. A building that contains a use as permitted by Section 18.43.060 B. 1. c. may be
constructed within the RPZ as a conditional use. The height of such structure shall
not exceed one vertical foot in height for each 20 feet horizontal distance from the
primary surface.
2. Approach Surface (inclusive of Inner and Outer Approach Surfaces). No building,
structure or utility line shall be erected and no tree or other natural feature shall be
permitted to grow or develop which penetrates the Airport Approach Surface. Such height
is measured from the Runway End Elevation nearest the feature to the highest part of the
feature, including any appurtenances of such feature.

3. Horizontal Surface. No building, structure or utility line shall be erected and no tree or
other natural feature shall be permitted to grow that penetrates the Airport Horizontal
Surface. The Horizontal Surface is one hundred fifty (150) feet above the Established
Elevation of the Airport and elevation of the terrain at the location of the object is
considered in the calculation.
4. Transitional Surface. No building, structure or utility line shall be erected and no tree or
other natural feature shall be permitted to grow or develop which is more than one (1) foot
in height for each seven (7) feet that feature is distant from the sides of the Primary
Surface or from the sides of approach surfaces. Such height is measured from the
elevation of the point along the centerline of the runway that forms a perpendicular line
between the feature and that point to the runway centerline, to the top of such feature.
B. Height Exceptions. Height exceptions or variances may be permitted only when supported in
writing by the FAA. Variances requests shall follow the standard city application process. If
supported by the FAA, variances may include the installation of obstruction lights or other painted
marking, of which the cost for installation, operation and maintenance will be solely the
responsibility of the developer. If the term(s) of the variance are not upheld, the use will not be
grandfathered, and the use will be considered out of compliance with this AOZ.

4. Emissions. No agricultural, industrial, mining or similar use, or expansion of an existing
agricultural, industrial, mining or similar use, shall, as part of its regular operations, cause
emissions of smoke, dust, or steam that could obscure visibility of pilots.
5. Communications Facilities and Electrical Interference. No use shall cause or create
electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communications operated on the
airport or operated between an airport and aircraft. New or expanded radio, radiotelephone,
and television transmission facilities and electrical transmission lines within
any established airport Surface shall be coordinated with FAA prior to approval.

6. Water Impoundments and Wildlife Attractants. No new or expanded water impoundments
of one-quarter (1/4) acre in size or larger are permitted within any established airport
zone, unless the Planning Commission makes the following findings:
a. The proposed water impoundment, taking into consideration any proposed or
recommended mitigation measures, will not significantly increase the risk of bird
strike hazards to air navigation;
b. Proposed mitigation measures are based on accepted technology and industry
practices, and have been demonstrated to be effective, reliable over time, and
affordable to implement; and
c. The applicant has demonstrated an ability to pay for necessary short-term and
long-term mitigation measures, and to ensure the perpetual implementation,
monitoring, and maintenance of such measures.
7. Unmanned Aerial Systems or Drones. Any use of an unmanned aerial system or drone
must comply with applicable FAA regulations. In the event of conflicting FAA
requirements, the most restrictive requirements shall apply. If notification or permission of
the airport manager is required by FAA regulations, the airport manager shall not give
permission for use of such vehicles within the AOZ.
8. Other Hazards to Aircraft Operations. In addition to the specific prohibitions stated in this
subsection, no use or structure shall otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or
maneuvering of aircraft.

A. The purpose of the Manufacturing & Business (M&BP) Park Zone is to provide for development
of offices, research and development institutions, and light manufacturing establishments. The
general categories of uses allowed within this zone are more limited than other commercial
or manufacturing zones. These restrictions are based on operating characteristics and land use
impacts rather than type of service or product. The essential purpose of this district is to achieve
development in a setting that is an economic asset to the community. The zone may be located
adjacent to quality residential development and must be beautified to create the highest degree
of compatibility. The zone should always be located adjacent to collector or arterial streets. It is
not the intent of this chapter that an M&B Park zone should become a catalyst for strip
commercial development around its perimeter. Unless the General Plan calls for a Commercial
center near the park's boundary, commercial development shall not be allowed, particularly
where the park is surrounded by residential development.
B. Objectives. The purpose of this chapter is to establish rules, regulations, standards,
and procedures for approval of all Manufacturing and Business parks in order to:
1. Strengthen and sustain the economic potential of the City and to create jobs
2. Advance and promote business development
3. Implement the adopted policies of the Heber City General Plan

18.62.060 Subdivision Of Mixed-Use Community
18.62.070 Definition Of Terms
18.62.010 Introduction
A. Purpose and Intent. The intent of the Planned Community Mixed-Use (PCMU) Code is to
promote and foster a traditional mixed-use neighborhood and village center including
opportunities to live, work, shop and recreate while preserving the rural character of the Heber
Valley. With proper form, a greater integration of building uses is natural, comfortable, and
ecologically sustainable. This Code created this form-Multiple residential uses, minor commercial
areas, civic spaces, and a network of streets and trails. The regulations of the PCMU Code
contained herein are designed to: 1)Encourage the City to do detailed planning based on design
and form rather than Euclidian Zoning; 2) Cultivate holistic neighborhoods that include a
framework of pedestrian and bicycle systems, which provide alternatives to the automobile,
allowing independence for those who do not drive or choose to drive less; 3) Promote creative
and indigenous landscape and architecture that blends in with the natural surroundings and
follows project specified design guidelines; 4) Stimulate the local economy and increase the tax
base of the City; 5) Promote the preservation of agricultural lands, open space, scenic vistas,
natural features and respect historical precedents by increasing density within the City; 6)
Establish guiding principles through language and images for all new community development
within the PCMU Zone and to ensure that the economic, environmental, and social justice needs
of a community are met; 7) Regulate and control development in Heber City to produce safe,
attractive, and enjoyable public spaces complemented with a healthy mix of uses; and 8)
Promote affordable housing by offering multiple housing types within each neighborhood.
B. Applicability. Provisions of this Code are activated by shall when required; should when
recommended; and may when optional. The provisions of this Code, when in conflict with other
City Ordinances, shall take precedence over those of other Codes, Ordinances, Regulations, and
Standards except adopted IBC (International Building Code) Standards. The Code and
Ordinances of the City continue to be applicable to issues not covered by this PCMU Ordinance,
except where these would contradict the Purpose and Intent Section, in which case the conflict
shall be resolved in favor of this Code. Terms used throughout this Code shall be accorded their
commonly accepted meanings or as defined in the Definitions of Terms Section. In the event of
conflicts between these definitions and those of other City Ordinances, those of this Code shall
take precedence.
C. Structure of the Code. The Planned Community Mixed-Use Code uses simple language and
clear graphic prescriptions and parameters for building height, building site, and building
elements to address the basic necessities for forming good public spaces.
D. Authority. The Planned Community Mixed-Use Code is a legal document that regulates land
development by setting careful and coherent controls on building form while employing more
flexible parameters relative to building use and density. This Code was adopted to promote the
health, safety and general welfare of residents of Heber City, conserve agricultural land,
conserve energy and natural resources, reduce vehicular traffic, encourage walkability, support
downtown Heber City, and reduce suburban sprawl development.

B. Transect Districts. The Planned Community Mixed-Use (PCMU) Code utilizes the Transect
Districts. These Districts are a system of ordering human habitats in a range from the most
natural to the most urban. It is based upon six districts which describe the physical character of
place at any scale, according to the density and intensity of land use and urbanism. Heber City
PCMUs zone will utilize two (2) of these districts: Transect Districts Three, which is
Neighborhood General and Transect District Four, Village Center. Although this Code is
specifically adopted for using Districts Neighborhood General (NG) and Village Center (VC),
other districts may be added if the Heber City Council decides to expand the Code. Transect
Districts shall be constituted of the elements described in Table 1 in the Development
Requirements, Standards, and Tables Section. Each proposed PCMU plan shall allocate
Transect Districts with the percentage use ranges outlined below. The districts available for
inclusion in a PCMU Zone are:
1. Neighborhood General (NG)  the most natural, least dense, most Residential of the
urbanized areas. At least 40% of each PCMU plan must utilize this District.
2. Village Center (VC)  the most varied Residential area (mixed-use allowed). At least 20%
of each PCMU plan must utilize this District.

Area shall be allocated to the various Districts according to the parameters specified in
Table 2.
2. The Overall Density shall be calculated in terms of housing units as specified for the area
of each District by Table 2.
3. For purposes of Density, calculations shall be based on the gross application boundary.
4. A minimum residential housing mix shall be required within each District as follows:
a. NG Neighborhood General  at least two residential types as delineated in Table
8a, with each type at least 30% of the total units within NG Districts.
b. VC Village Center  at least three residential types as delineated in Table 8a,
with each type at least 20% of the total units within VC Districts.
c. Residential Mixed-Use shall constitute a minimum of 10% of the housing in VC
except when VCs are 25 acres or less.
5. Project applicants may jointly apply with adjacent project applicants to satisfy the
minimum residential density and housing mix requirements.

purposes of determining building height.
Third Place: a private building that includes a space conducive to unstructured social gathering.
Third Places are usually bars, cafes, and corner stores.
Thoroughfare: a vehicular way incorporating moving lanes and parking lanes within a right of
way.
Transect Districts: Transect Districts are administratively similar to the landuse zones in
conventional codes, except that in addition to the usual building use, density, height, and setback
requirements, other elements of the intended habitat are integrated, including those of the private
lot and building and the enfronting public streetscape. The elements are determined by their
location on the Transect scale. The Transect Districts included in this Code are T3 Sub-Urban
(Neighborhood General), T4 General Urban (Village Center) (see Table 1).
Walkable Neighborhood: an area, approximately circular, that is centered on a Common
Destination. A Walkable Neighborhood is applied to determine the approximate size of a
Neighborhood. A Standard Walkable Neighborhood is 1/4 mile radius or 1320 feet, about the
distance of a five-minute walk at a leisurely pace. It has been shown that provided with a
pedestrian environment, most people will walk this distance rather than drive.
Warrant: a ruling by the governing body be it a Development Review Committee (DRC) or a
City, that would permit a practice that is not consistent with a specific provision of this Code, but
is justified by its Intent.

A. The RA-2 Residential-agricultural Zone has been established for the primary purpose of
providing a location where residential development associated with limited numbers of livestock
can be maintained. This Zone is characterized by large lots or tracts of land interspersed with
dwellings, barns, corrals and agricultural service buildings used in connection with farming
operations. While the zone is thus characterized, it is intended that the land within this zone shall
be furthur developed into a residential environment exclusive of animals and fowl. Builders and
developers of property should bear in mind, therefore, that privacy is given in this zone to
residential development and that the raising of animals and fowl will likely be curtained as
residential development takes place.

access to adjoining property in order to provide an orderly development of a street system,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication and construction to the boundary of such
property.
E. Access Management. No individual property shall establish a driveway to any state highway,
Minor or Major Collector or Arterial Street as identified by the Heber City Transportation Plan.
Upon approval of the City Engineer and/or the Utah Transportation Department (UDOT), multiple
properties may establish a shared, joint access to such streets, provided measures (i.e. right-in,
right-out driveways, dedicated turn lanes, etc.) are taken to protect the ability of the street to
accommodate planned future traffic at the intended speed and adopted level of service, and that
such shared, joint accesses are a secondary point of access and not the primary access to the
properties.
F. Street Standards. All local public streets, shall meet the requirements and standards for the
currently adopted standard for local streets.
1. Arterial and Collector Streets identified on the Transportation Plan shall meet the currently

https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 188/336
C. Each Development Plan shall identify the type of open space, location, and acres. The amount of
open space per Development Plan shall be equal to the amount of open space required in the
Master Plan.
D. Participants in the approval processes shall identify what is to be considered as open space by
using the following parameters as a guide:
1. Waterways, water bodies, man-made water features, wetlands, steep slopes, and other
areas to remain undeveloped may be included in the calculation for the open space
requirement.
2. Active, non-hard surface recreation areas, such as golf, skiing, hiking, and biking trails
may be included in the calculation for the open space requirement.
3. Common park areas with passive (landscaping, lawn areas, picnic, and bench areas) and
active areas (soccer fields, baseball diamonds, tennis courts, fishing ponds, playgrounds,
park gazebos) may be included in the calculation for the open space requirement,
provided they are used for scenic, landscaping or recreation purposes and they are
located on land which is accessible and available to all occupants of dwelling units for
whose use the common park area is intended.
4. Buffer zones along the property boundaries may be included in the calculation for the
open space requirement.
5. Natural, unimproved or non-landscaped areas with passive uses contiguous to other open
space may be included in the calculation for the open space requirement.
6. Parking lots, parking area landscaping buffers, paved roads, service roads, private yards,
buildings or structures, required setbacks for buildings or structures, and all subdivided
parcels less than one (1) acre shall not be included in the calculation for the open space
requirement.
7. In the event that the City requires a deeded right of way to accommodate infrastructure
improvements that were not originally anticipated by the Master Plan, the City may reduce
the overall open space requirement. However, such a reduction in open space shall not
exceed the area or property required to accommodate the infrastructure.
E. The following factors shall be considered when determining the responsibility for the
preservation, maintenance and ownership of open space within the development, consistent with
the rights and responsibilities delineated in the development agreement.
1. Compliance with the provisions of the Condominium Ownership Act, Title 57, Chapter 8,
Utah Code Annotated, as amended, which provides for the payment of common
expenses for the upkeep of the common area and facilities;
2. The developer may retain ownership and responsibility for maintenance of the designated
open space, but then shall commit to such responsibility through written agreement with
all parties who subsequently acquire ownership of property within the Master Planned
development;
3. The Property Owners Association may retain ownership and responsibility for
maintenance of the designated open space, but then shall commit to such responsibility
through written agreement with all parties who subsequently acquire ownership of
property within the Master Planned development;

cuts and fills and to avoid permanent scarring of hillsides, and to provide access for fire
protection, snow removal, school buses, road maintenance, and other emergency
vehicles;
5. to provide regulations for the placement of buildings in such a manner to permit ample
room so that such buildings will meet existing setback requirements and provide
guidelines for landscaping, surface drainage, parking between and around buildings and
utility services;
6. to provide standards for grading, cuts and fills that will eliminate unnecessary scarring
and earth disturbance and will reduce environmental intrusion;
7. to establish requirements pertaining to streets, rights-of-way, grades, lot layouts and
structure designs which will aid in promoting health and safety, provide functional beauty,
and reduce destruction to hillsides and wildlife;
8. to provide measures for the establishment of traffic control and circulation facilities that
insure proper ingress and egress of vehicles during the four seasons of the year;
9. to encourage a variety of development designs and concepts which will preserve open

7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 199/336
2. Provide an alternative means for owners of larger properties in the city to maintain and
control vegetation on their property through the pasturing of grazing animals; and
3. Promote a green pastoral and rural town lifestyle.
B. The raising, care and keeping of animals for personal family use and consumption is permitted in
all zones. Animals are limited to only those specified:
1. Large animals: horses, cows, llamas, alpacas, or ostriches, but not including pigs;
2. Medium animals: sheep and goats, but not including pigs.
C. Animals shall not be kept within the front yard of any dwelling or main building, and shall be kept
at least 20 feet from the rear of the dwelling or main building, and at least 10 feet from the side of
the dwelling or main building. Barns and corrals shall be located as per Section 18.68.130.
Animals shall not be permitted to wallow within or access a stream or canal.
D. At least 34,000 square feet of green landscaped pasture area shall be maintained for each large
animal, and at least 9,000 square feet of green landscaped pasture area shall be maintained for
each medium animal.
E. The premises upon which animals are kept shall be maintained in a clean, sanitary, and
reasonably odor-free condition, and animals shall be kept controlled on the property at all times.
F. The property upon which the animals are kept is required to be maintained in a green pastoral
condition. In the event a pasture becomes overgrazed, the number of animals on a property will
need to be reduced. Overgrazing occurs when animals are permitted to graze vegetative cover
excessively to the detriment of the vegetation, often characterized by soil erosion, dusty or
muddy conditions, soil compaction, increased water runoff, noxious weed invasion, trampled
vegetation, or a lack of grazing (i.e. hay or alfalfa) vegetation. A green pastoral condition exists
when the land is not overgrazed, often characterized by the existence of healthy, non-trampled,
green and growing vegetation (or dormant vegetation in non-growing months), healthy noncompacted
soils, along with minimal dust, mud and weeds.
G. The provisions of this Section (Section 18.68.135) do not impair, enhance, or otherwise regulate
non-conforming animal uses, or the uses of zones which expressly permit the keeping of
animals.
H. Animals which create noise that disturbs neighbors shall be considered a public nuisance
pursuant to Chapter 8.04 of this code.

18.102.110 Definitions
18.102.010 Findings
A. Heber City has adopted a Moderate Income Housing Element of the General Plan as required by
Utah State Code, which looks at the estimated existing supply, the estimated five year need, a
survey and evaluation of zoning's effect on affordable housing, and a description of Heber's
programs to encourage an adequate supply of affordable housing;
B. The Moderate Income Housing Element of the General Plan shows that there is a continuing
shortage of affordable housing in the City, which is detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare, as it contributes to overcrowded and substandard conditions for lower-income families,
and the inability of industry to find and retain a quality labor supply;
C. A Nexus Study performed for the valley, an exhibit to the Moderate Income Housing Element of
the General Plan, shows that new development which does not include or provide for affordable
housing serves to aggravate the current affordable housing shortage, by reducing the supply of
residential land available for affordable housing development, and creating larger numbers of
service oriented, low-paying jobs, creating a greater demand for affordable housing by increasing
the numbers of lower wage earners;
D. A requirement for ten percent (10%) of all new residential units being created as affordable
housing units is strongly recommended to implement the Goals and Policies of the Moderate
Income Housing Element of the General Plan;
E. A Needs Assessment performed for the valley, an exhibit to the Moderate Income Housing
Element of the General Plan, shows that a Fee-in-Lieu may be assessed as an alternative to
providing onsite affordable housing; and
F. Costs for implementing the requirement to contribute to affordable housing can be offset by
allowing reasonable development incentives.

would be required to make a typical new starter home consisting of three Bedrooms/two baths affordable
to a family earning 80% of the median gross income of the metropolitan statistical area for households of
the same size. To ensure proportionality to each development, the Fee-in-Lieu is determined as follows:
A. For developments with detached single-family lots, the Fee-in-Lieu shall be calculated as 6% (six
percent) of the value of the subdivision lots as determined by a written appraisal by an MAI
Certified Appraiser.
B. For all other residential developments, the Fee-in-Lieu shall be calculated as 3% (three percent)
of the value of the development as determined by a written appraisal by an MAI Certified
Appraiser.
C. The Fee-in-Lieu shall be adjusted to current market conditions for developments that have not
recorded or have not been constructed within 2 years of approval. It is the responsibility of the
developer to submit an updated appraisal of the development value to determine the updated
Fee-in-Lieu.
D. Heber City and/or the Wasatch County Housing Authority reserves the right to obtain and utilize
a second opinion from an Appraiser or Qualified Real Estate Professional to determine the
development value used to calculate the Fee-in-Lieu.
E. All Fees-in-Lieu shall be deposited in a Housing Trust Fund. Said fund shall be administered by
the Wasatch County Housing Authority and shall be used for the purpose of providing funding
assistance for the provision of affordable housing of both for rent and for sale units, the
alternatives approved under Section 18.102.040 C. of this ordinance, and reasonable costs of
administration consistent with the policies and programs of the Wasatch County Housing
Authority.
F. Affordable Housing Alternatives shall be of a value not less the amount that would have been
paid as the Fee-in-Lieu. Title to all dedicated lots shall be unencumbered, including being clear of
all taxes and liens, all such being paid and cleared. All dedicated lots shall be buildable, being of
sufficient size and shape to accommodate at least the minimum sized home permitted by the
zoning ordinance, plus accommodate required parking spaces and setbacks.

It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate signs and to authorize the use of signs that are compatible
with their surroundings, are legible under the circumstances in which they are seen, are effective in
indexing the environment, and are conducive to promoting traffic safety and the convenience and
enjoyment of public travel by preventing visual distraction; protecting pedestrians; attracting tourists to
the City; preserving and enhancing property values; establishing first-class business and commercial
districts; and eliminating fire hazards. It is also the intention and purpose of this Chapter to promote
short and long term civic beauty and order by establishing standards and regulations for sign design,
location, size, type, compatibility, and aesthetics. By doing so it is hoped this ordinance will help to
create streetscapes that are functional and attractive to both residents of Heber City as well as visitors.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2004-13 on 6/17/2004
18.103.020 Scope
The intent is to regulate the design and placement of commercial and governmental
identification/communication devices and structures that are built specifically to identify, inform, and
direct patrons to a particular merchant, store, establishment, or service. It is not the intent of this
ordinance to regulate the content of public speech. The regulations of this Chapter are intended to apply
to both on-premise and off-premise signs, but do not apply to hand-held placards and other similar
devices traditionally used for public protest and the exercise of free speech. Any non-commercial
message may be substituted for any commercial message permitted under this ordinance.

declared to be the maximum allowable for the purposes set forth. If the Zoning Administrator determines
that an application needs further interpretation, he may request Planning Commission review of the
proposal. If the applicant wishes to propose or retain a sign that exceeds ordinance standards, he may
apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance or special exception.

C. Legal Action. The Zoning Administrator shall be empowered to institute any appropriate action or
proceeding in any case where any sign is illegally erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,

Ordinance including, but not limited to the Land Development Code by:
1. Issue Notices of Violations, Citations, and Information. The Zoning Administrator or his
designee may issue a written notice of violation to the person having charge or control or
benefit of any sign found to be unsafe or dangerous or in violation of this code,
particularly when the City is contemplating removal of said sign. Such official may also
issue criminal citations and swear to information against violators.
2. Abate and Remove Unsafe or Dangerous Sign. If an unsafe or dangerous sign is not
repaired or made safe within five working days after giving said notice, the Zoning
Administrator may at once abate and remove said sign, and the person having charge,
control, or benefit of any such sign shall pay to Heber City within 30 calendar days after
written notice is mailed to such person the costs incurred in such removal.
3. Abate and Remove illegal Sign.

4. Abate and Remove Non-Maintained, Abandoned, or Sign Identifying a Discontinued Use.
The Zoning Administrator shall require each non-maintained, abandoned, or sign
identifying a discontinued use to be removed from the building or premises when such

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2004-13 on 6/17/2004
18.103.060 Nonconforming Signs
A. Previous Illegally Placed Signs. Previous illegal signs shall not be grandfathered in under this
Chapter.
B. Regulation, Containment, and Elimination. In order to minimize confusion and unfair competitive
disadvantage to those businesses which are required to satisfy the current sign ordinance
standards, the City intends to apply firm regulation of existing nonconforming signs with a view to
their eventual elimination. This goal shall be achieved by strictly construing limits on change,
expansion, alteration, abandonment, and restoration. Excluding normal maintenance and repair,
a nonconforming sign shall not be moved, altered (including face changes) or enlarged unless it
is brought into complete compliance with this Chapter. The following alterations are exempt from
this provision: (1) Copy changes in nonconforming permanent signs which were originally
approved by the City with a changeable copy feature; and (2) Existing non-compliant pole signs
that are non-compliant because of height, area, or setback, but not non-conforming pole signs
which project over a property line, may be altered but shall be required to come into compliance
with the current height requirements when altered but may retain the original area of the existing
sign.
C. Abandonment. Within 45 calendar days after vacation of an existing business, any on-site
nonconforming signs must be removed or brought into compliance by the property owner. If
removal does not occur, Heber City may have the entire nonconforming sign (both face and
structure) removed through the processes specified in Section 18.103.050 C. An abandoned sign
may not regain any legal nonconforming status later, even if the original business re-occupies the
property.
D. Special Exceptions. Upon appeal by the sign owner or business, the Board of Adjustment is
empowered to grant a Special Exception to allow the retention, alteration, movement, or
expansion of a nonconforming sign, provided the Board determines that (l) the nonconforming
sign poses an alternative equivalent means of meeting the intent of this Chapter and the City's
Comprehensive Plan; (2) the action will not impose a burden on other properties in the City
beyond that posed by a conforming sign; and (3) approval will provide a forum for free
expression or other articulable benefits to the public. Unfair competitive disadvantage of
businesses in the City whose signs do comply with this Chapter is to be construed as a burden to
be considered by the Board of Adjustment. A new business generally shall not qualify for a
Special Exception for reuse of a nonconforming sign left by a previous business. Purely
economic factors, such as the expense of removing or altering a nonconforming sign or of
purchasing a new conforming sign are not to be considered as reasons for granting a Special
Exception by the Board. The Board is empowered to attach reasonable requirements with which
the petitioner must comply as a condition of approval of a Special Exception. The duration of the
special exception shall not extend beyond that period allowed by any amortization ordinance in
effect at the date the exception is grantedand any special exception shall be conditioned on the
posting of a bond with the City sufficient to cover the cost of timely removal of such sign.

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2004-13 on 6/17/2004
Amended by Ord. 2018-23 on 6/13/2018
18.103.090 Signs That Require A Permit
A. Purpose - Streetscape. The streetscape is the combination of vehicles, buildings, signs,
landscaping, roads, utility poles, etc., that dominate the view of the driver or pedestrian. The
streetscape tells residents and visitors how the City as a whole feels about the environment,
safety, aesthetics, and its sense of order, among other things. A useful, attractive, and safe
streetscape is one that necessarily regulates the size, location, and design of business signs.
Because a proliferation of poorly designed, oversized, and inappropriately located signs in
commercial and industrial areas can be detrimental to the achievement of effective, safe and
attractive streetscapes, it is important that the permanent signs in these areas receive approval
(permits) from the City. Commercial and industrial uses are generally more intensive than those
found in residential zones. Since these uses are designed by size, location, and style to attract
attention and provide services to the public, they generally need signage to achieve that end.
Business signs of any kind in residential neighborhoods can diminish the quality of life for which
those zones were specifically created. However, there may be some residential uses which merit
a sign, though much smaller and subdued than in commercial or industrial zones. Therefore, it is
the intent and purpose of this section to outline regulations and design standards for signs in
both commercial/industrial and residential areas that will allow the business to identify itself while
allowing Heber City to create and maintain safe and aesthetically pleasing streetscapes
regardless of zone.

B. Sign Theme Required. All planned shopping centers/buildings and developments of parcels
19,000 square feet or larger must submit a proposal for all on-premise signs to the Planning
Commission for design and placement approval as part of a new or change of use development
approval by the Planning Commission
C. Electronic Message Centers, Changeable Copy Areas and Reader Boards. Such signs are
permitted but discouraged and shall only be permitted as part of a main sign and shall not
exceed 25% of the total sign copy area of the sign. No such sign shall blink, scroll, flash, use
chaser lights or move in any way, and shall not display the message in a manner that constitutes
a traffic hazard or nuisance as determined by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission.
D. On-Premise Freestanding Signs. The Zoning Administrator may approve one freestanding sign
per street frontage. No free standing sign shall be allowed for any parcel that has less than
19,000 square feet or less than 99 feet of street frontage. Sign height shall not exceed twentyfive
(25) feet. Signs must be located 45 feet from the street corner. Sign area may not exceed 50
square feet. There shall be a minimum of 7 feet of open space below the sign. Each sign shall be
located upon a lawn or landscaped area, or within a masonry, concrete, stone, or brick
landscape box at least 18 inches in height or within a landscaped area surrounded by a 6 inch
tall control curb if located upon a hard surfaced area.
1. As a conditional use, the Planning Commission may approve a request for a freestanding
sign upon a parcel less than 19,000 square feet or less than 99 feet of street frontage if
the Planning Commission finds that the property, property location, existing structures
and driveways are configured such that a monument sign would constitute a hazard to
traffic and pedestrians. Any sign approved in this manner must meet all other applicable
standards for freestanding signs in this Chapter.
E. On-Premise Freestanding Signs for Planned commercial/industrial developments. The Zoning
Administrator may approve one freestanding sign per street frontage for planned shopping
centers with 3 or more tenants. No freestanding sign shall be allowed for any planned center or
parcel that has less than 99 feet of street frontage. Sign height shall not exceed twenty-five (25)
feet. Signs must be located 45 feet from the street corner. Sign area shall not exceed 20 square
feet per tenant or 150 square feet, whichever is less. The sign shall have a logo/identification

stone, or brick landscape box at least 18 inches in height or within a landscaped area surrounded
by a 6 inch tall control curb if located upon a hard surfaced area.
1. As a conditional use, the Planning Commission may approve a request for a freestanding
sign upon a parcel with less than 99 feet of street frontage if the Planning Commission
finds that the property, property location, existing structures and driveways are configured
such that a monument sign would constitute a hazard to traffic and pedestrians. Any sign
approved in this manner must meet all other applicable standards for freestanding signs
in this chapter.

G. Flat Signs. Flat signs should be the primary form of identification for business uses in the City.
Each business is entitled to one flat sign if the following criteria are met:
1. The sign may not occupy more than 15% or 300 square feet, which ever is less, of the
front flat wall area of the first floor or story of the building.
2. The 15% area of the primary wall may be divided into more than one sign under the
following requirements and restrictions:
a. The sign package blends with the aesthetics of the building and surrounding
natural and manmade environment.
b. The sign package color, style, size, scale and proportion enhances the exterior of
the building and does not place too much bulk and external distractions on the
exterior of the building.
c. The number of signs is appropriate to the scale of the building.
d. The maximum number of flat signs on any given wall, including multi-tenant
buildings, shall be seven [7]. For the purpose of this ordinance, a sign will be
considered a complete phrase and the suggested layout of the sign package (i.e.,
the individual words may either be lumped together as one phrase to equal 1 sign,
or spread out to be many different signs, such as "1 Hour Photo" would be
considered one sign.)
e. The maximum number of multiple flat signs on any given wall shall be limited to
seven [7]. The maximum square footage shall be limited be 300 square feet or
15% of the wall, whichever is less.
f. Multi-tenant buildings may receive a conditional use permit so that the building
may exceed the maximum number of signs to accommodate the additional sign if
the Planning Commission judges the additional sign to be consistent with the
criteria set forth above.
g. Multiple flat signs shall utilize individual lettering and logos only. No multiple
cabinet signs or combination of cabinet and individual lettering signs shall be
approved. It is encouraged that the use of multiple materials and lettering styles,
such as exposed neon, different type styles, and use of logos in conjunction with
the lettering be implemented.
3. Painted signs applied directly to any building face are specifically prohibited.
4. Buildings or businesses with exposure on the side(s) and front may choose which wall to
mount their sign upon. Signs are allowed on the rear of the building with Planning
Commission approval.
5. Owners of buildings that have small offices inside, accessory and/or secondary to the
main use are required to create a building identification sign instead of trying to obtain
signage for every tenant. This is especially true for buildings with two or more levels.
6. Flat signs on sloping roofs shall be erected so as to appear as a sign applied to a similarly
vertical wall surface and finished in such a manner that the visual appearance from all
sides is such that they appear to be part of the building itself. All such signs shall be
installed or erected in such a manner that there is no visual support structure such as guy
wires or braces and shall not project more than 3 feet above the top edge of the vertical
surface of the wall.
7. No flat sign including any light box or structural part, shall project more than 18 inches
from the face of the building to which it is attached.

area formed by the street property lines and a line connecting them at a point 45
feet from the intersection of the street lines.
I. Suspended and projecting Signs. Suspended or projecting signs are allowed if the architecture of
the building or planned center lends itself to that design and a sign theme is submitted and
approved by the Zoning Administrator. The following shall apply:

restrictive than in commercial areas.
1. On-Premise Signs for Home Occupations, Hair and Beauty Salons, and Day Care and
Nursery Schools. The Zoning Administrator may permit one non-illuminated flat wall sign
2 square feet in area which identifies the name of the business. This applies to uses

18.106.070 Design Guidelines
18.106.010 Purpose
It is the intent of this section to protect the valuable views of the ridgelines of Heber City by providing
regulations, which will limit the building of structures that protrude above primary and secondary
ridgelines, or will mitigate the appearance of such structures if prevention is not possible.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2018-35 on 7/19/2018
18.106.020 Applicability
These regulations apply to all land use applications in Heber City for which any portion of a proposed
structure protrudes above ridgelines when viewed from the designated viewing platforms as shown on
the adopted viewing platform map. Any rezoning, proposed development or building permit shall be
subject to compliance with these regulations, irrespective of whether specific reference to the regulations
is made in this title. In the event of an overlapping or conflicting requirement of this chapter and other
provisions or regulations in this code, the more restrictive provision shall apply. All proposals for
development of preexisting lots of record or platted plots that may be located within the primary or
secondary ridgeline areas are subject to conditional use approval.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2018-35 on 7/19/2018
18.106.030 Definitions
A. Ridgeline Development Classification. Whether or not a "ridgeline", as defined in Chapter
18.106 of this title, is regulated by this section is determined by whether or not the ridgeline is
significant. "Significant ridgelines" are defined as those ridgelines that surround or visually
dominate the valley landscape either through their size in relation to the hillside or mountain
terrain of which they are a part as viewed from a viewing platform; their visual dominance as
characterized by a silhouetting appearance against the sky as viewed from a viewing platform; as
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 284/336
a significant natural backdrop feature or separation of communities from a viewing platform;
through visual dominance due to proximity and view from a viewing platform; or as an area of
significant ecological, historical or cultural importance, such as those which connect park or trail
systems. If a ridgeline meets any combination of these criteria, it shall qualify as subject to
regulation under this section.
B. Primary Ridgelines. Primary ridgelines are those ridgelines that are characterized by any
combination of significant ridgeline criteria as identified in ridgeline development classification.
C. Secondary Ridgelines. Secondary ridgelines are those ridgelines that are characterized by any
combination of significant ridgeline criteria as identified in the ridgeline development classification
above. Secondary ridgelines are secondary in nature to primary ridgelines due to the following
features:
1. Smaller size and prominence of a feature or branch of a primary ridgeline; and
2. Silhouette of a ridgeline against the open sky on a smaller size hill or silhouette of a
ridgeline on a smaller hill which is back dropped by a significant ridgeline.
D. Viewing Platforms. Viewing platforms are selected from the list in Section 18.106.050 using the
ridgeline development classification of this section to determine which four (4) platforms should
be used to determine whether a significant ridgeline will be violated. In the event there are not
four (4) viewing platforms from any state or federal highway or major collector road, also, in the
event that: a) a development is large in nature and visible from several roads or highways or
different sections of roads or highways; or b) a development will encroach on more than one
significant ridgeline, Planning Staff may select additional viewing platforms along state or federal
highways or major collector roads up to eight (8) total viewing platforms based on the ridgeline
development classification above.
E. Visual Assessment Model. A visual assessment model is a computer 3-D image as viewed
from the viewing platforms selected in accordance with Subsection D. The 3-D image will be
used to determine if the proposed development will be considered to be on a ridgeline.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2018-35 on 7/19/2018
18.106.040 Requirements And Procedures
A. Proposed Developments. Proposed developments shall locate lots and building pads so that
structures will not violate this section. At the time a development is proposed, the applicant shall
provide a visual assessment model from viewing platforms selected in accordance with Section
18.106.030. If the proposed development is considered by the planning director to be on a
significant ridgeline, the developer shall submit photo simulations, drawings, computer modeling,
or some other means that will allow a determination to be made by the Planning Commission and
City Council that structures will be built below the ridgeline. The photo simulations, computer
modeling, or drawings shall be done from the same viewing platforms as the visual assessment
model. The final plat shall have building envelopes that limit the location and height of the
structure to the locations and heights used in the ridgeline modeling to ensure that this section is
not violated. The ridgelines will be addressed at the preliminary and final approvals so that the
final ridgeline modeling will correspond with the final plat and building envelope locations.

B. Existing Platted Lots or Lots of Record. Existing platted lots or lots of record shall be reviewed
by the Planning Staff. If Planning Staff and applicant cannot agree on mitigation requirements the
item will be required to go to the Planning Commission as a conditional use that will be applied
for with the building permit. The Planning Commission may set reasonable conditions to mitigate
the visual impacts as designated in Section 18.106.070, "Design Guidelines". Existing platted lots
or lots of record are those lots that were platted and recorded prior to the adoption of this title. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to notify the planning department of their intent to build
in the location of a ridgeline at which time a visual assessment model will be run from the four (4)
closest viewing platforms to determine if the proposed structure is on a ridgeline. As part of the
conditional use application, building renderings, colors, materials, photo simulations, computer
modeling or drawings shall be submitted.
C. Appeals. Appeals of the decisions of the Planning Staff will be made to the Board of Adjustment.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2018-35 on 7/19/2018

7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 286/336
For proposed developments, the applicant shall perform a visual assessment from the viewing platform
selected above, as directed by the Planning Department, depicting conditions before and after the
proposed development. The visual assessment shall include the proposed location, size, design,
landscaping and other visual features of the project to assist in analyzing the potential aesthetic impact
and most advantageous location of structures and other improvements to either: 1) eliminate
development on a significant ridgeline; or 2) reduce any adverse impacts of development on a lot of
record or existing platted lot. The visual assessment shall be conducted using techniques as approved
by the Planning Department, including, but not limited to, sketches, models, hand enhanced
photographs and computerized images. Selection of the appropriate technique will depend on the size of
the development and the visual sensitivity of the proposed development site.
HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. 2018-35 on 7/19/2018
18.106.070 Design Guidelines
The following design guidelines shall apply to any buildings constructed within the ridgeline as a
conditional use.
A. Colors/Reflectivity. All structures and accessory uses shall be constructed and maintained so
that predominate exterior wall colors (including the colors of basement walls on the downhill side
of the structure) and roof surfacing materials:
1. Repeat the colors found most commonly in the land and vegetation around the building (
earth tone);
2. Reflective materials and bright colors that contrast dramatically with the colors of the land
and vegetation around them shall not be used as predominant colors on any fence, wall
or roof surface.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://heber.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=18_Zoning 287/336
B. Vegetation. Planning Staff shall review the appearance of the structure and make a
determination of any reasonable number of trees and shrubs which may be necessary to mitigate
the visual impact of the placement of the structure or basement wall as visible from the viewing
platforms.
1. All trees installed to meet the requirements of this subsection shall be of coniferous
species, shall be a minimum of eight feet (8') tall when planted, and shall be planted
before a certificate of occupancy is issued for the primary structure, or if that is not
possible due to planting season or weather conditions, then within one month of the
planting season for the species. A bond may be required to ensure the planting.
2. To the maximum degree feasible, during grading, all existing mature vegetation with a
height of more than five feet (5'), other than noxious plants and weeds, shall be
preserved.
3. Concurrently with the building permit approval process, the property owner submitting
such plan may request approval of a vegetation plan in which the vegetation requirements
for certain lots or tracts may be increased, decreased or deleted, to reflect the degree of
visibility of structures located in various portions of the development.
4. The owner may request alternative placement of landscaping on certain lots and tracts if
such placement provides adequate mitigation of the visual impact of the roofline of the
primary structure.
5. Landscaping required by this subsection shall be credited against the landscaping
requirements imposed by any other section of the code, or the specific planned
development plan.
C. Floodlighting. Floodlights shall not be used to light all or any portion of any primary or
accessory structure facade, or landscaping, and all outdoor light sources mounted on poles,
buildings or trees to illuminate streets, sidewalks, walkways, parking lots or other outdoor areas
shall use full cutoff light fixtures. For purposes of this subsection, a "full cutoff light fixture" is one
in which no more than twenty five percent (25%) of the total output is emitted at ninety degrees
(90°) from the vertical pole or building wall on which it is mounted. All such fixtures shall be
installed or shielded so that part of the light bulb or light source is not visible beyond the property
boundaries. Exterior lighting in the hillside or skyline/ridgeline areas shall be shielded from direct
point source view from viewing platforms selected above. Whenever reasonable, motion
detectors should be considered to determine if their use would lessen the amount of time lights
would actually be in use on the hillside areas.
D. Exposed Basements. On the side of each primary and accessory structure facing the nearest
viewing platform, as determined by the planning department, no basement wall shall be exposed
for more than one-half (1/i) of its height, unless a vegetated berm at least three feet (3') in height
is constructed between such basement and the property line closest to the nearest viewing
platform. Excessively high basement walls on downhill sides of slopes will be reviewed on a case
by case basis. Planning Staff may require trees and shrubs of a coniferous variety to be planted
to mitigate the visibility of any basement wall that can be seen from selected viewing platform.

E. Viewshed Analysis. A viewshed analysis shall illustrate existing and proposed views from
selected viewing platforms. The Planning Department has or will identify several viewing
platforms which the applicant is required to prepare a viewshed analysis. Compatibility to the
surrounding environment and development, along with color, scale and massing, will be key
elements evaluated. The visual assessment shall be conducted using techniques as approved by
the county planner, including, but not limited to, sketches, models, hand enhanced photographs
and computerized images. Selection of the appropriate technique will depend on the size of the
development and the visual sensitivity of the proposed development site. The location of
buildings shown on the visual assessment shall coincide with the proposed building pads of the
proposed buildings, as well as the maximum size of the buildings proposed.

18.109.010 Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose And Objectives
A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. The Legislature of the State of Utah has in Utah Code
Annotated 10-3-701 delegated the responsibility to local governmental unites to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore the City Council of Heber City, Utah does ordain as follows:
B. FINDINGS OF FACT.
1. The flood hazard areas of Heber City are subject to periodic inundation, which results in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
2. These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which
cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard
areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are
inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
3. Severe flooding has occurred in the past within Heber City and will certainly occur within
the future. That flooding is likely to result in infliction of serious personal injury or death,
and is likely to result in substantial injury or destruction of property within its jurisdiction. In
order to effectively comply with minimum standards for coverage under the National Flood
Insurance Program, and in order to effectively remedy the situation described herein, it is
necessary that this ordinance become effective immediately.
4. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this ordinance, being necessary
for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force
and effect from and after its passage and approval.

C. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
7. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
D. METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES. In order to accomplish its purposes, this
ordinance uses the following methods:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood,
or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood
damage;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor;
provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable
non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood insurance Program
regulations.
AC. MANUFACTURED HOME - means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation
when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a
"recreational vehicle".
AD. MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION - means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
AE. MEAN SEA LEVEL - means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown
on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
AF. NEW CONSTRUCTION - means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or
after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which
the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management
regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
AG. NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION - means a manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the
manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
AH. RECREATIONAL VEHICLE - means a vehicle which is:
1. built on a single chassis;
2. 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
3. designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
4. designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

AI. START OF CONSTRUCTION - (for other than new construction or substantial improvements
under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement
and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180
days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of
piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
AJ. STRUCTURE - means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is
principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
AK. SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent
of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
AL. SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT - means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or
2. Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
AM. VARIANCE - is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this ordinance when specific
enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. (For full requirements see
Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.).
AN. VIOLATION - means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such
time as that documentation is provided.
AO. WATER SURFACE ELEVATION - means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that
land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the
community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
H. PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply
with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a Class B Misdemeanor. Any person who violates
this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be
fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than six month, or both, for each violation,
and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent Heber City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.

E. VARIANCE PROCEDURES
1. The Board of Adjustment as established by the community shall hear and render
judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance. In addition to
making the required findings for a variance pursuant to Utah State Code Section 10-9a-
702, the Board of Adjustment shall give consideration to the provisions of this Section
18.109.040 E.
2. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
3. Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal
such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
4. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and
shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
5. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places,
without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance.
6. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in
18.109.040 D. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
7. Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the Board
of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance (Section 18.109.010
C.).
8. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
9. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

10. Prerequisites for granting variances:
a. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
b. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) showing a good and sufficient cause;
(2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
(3) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
c. Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that
the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the
base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
11. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that:
a. the criteria outlined in Section 18.109.040 E. 1-9 are met; and
b. the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(including basement) elevated to at least one foot or above the base flood level or
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base
flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of
such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which such structures are flood-proofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
3. Enclosures - new construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:

4. Manufactured Homes.
a. Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's
FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize
flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must
be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
b. Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within
Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a
manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
c. Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE
on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of
this section be elevated so that either:
(1) the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least one foot above the
base flood elevation; or
(2) the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36
inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately

C. STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
1. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall be consistent with Section 18.109.010 B., C., and D. of this ordinance.
2. All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Development Permit requirements
of Section 18.109.030 C., Section 18.109.040 C., and the provisions of Section
18.109.050 of this ordinance.
3. Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other
proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise
provided pursuant to Section 18.109.030 B. or Section 18.109.040 B.8 of this ordinance.
4. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
5. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
D. STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES). Located within the
areas of special flood hazard established in Section 18.109.030 B., are areas designated as
shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1
to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as
high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if
no depth number is specified).
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures;
a. have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's
FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
b. together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the
base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
3. A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Section
18.109.040 C.1, are satisfied.
4. Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to
guide flood waters round and away from proposed structures.

E. FLOODWAYS. Floodways - located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section
18.109.030 B. are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion
potential, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements
and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge
2. If Section 18.109.050 E. 1.is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 18.109.050.
3. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood
Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted
regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided
that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through
FEMA.
F. CRITICAL FACILITY. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) (100-year floodplain).
Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest
floor elevated three feet or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and
from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Flood-proofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or
released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

18.110.210 Telecommunication Facilities To Permit, As A Conditional Use, A Radio Antenna
18.110.010 Purpose
The purposes of this ordinance are:
A. To regulate wireless services antennas and related electronic equipment and structures.
B. To provide for the orderly establishment of wireless services facilities in the City.
C. To minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the use of stealth
facilities, by encouraging the co-location of multiple antennas on a single structure, by
encouraging the location of antennas on pre-existing support structures, and by encouraging the
use of City and Government-owned property for antenna support structures.
D. To establish siting, appearance, and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts
related to the construction, use and maintenance of wireless services facilities.
E. To comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by establishing regulations that (1) do not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services, (2) do not
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services, and (3) are not
based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities
comply with the Federal Communication Commissions regulations concerning such emissions.

18.110.020 Findings
The City Council makes the following findings:
A. Wireless services devices are an integral part of the rapidly growing and evolving
telecommunications industry and present unique zoning challenges and concerns for the City.
B. The City needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its
customers to provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the City, against
the sometimes differing interests and desires of others concerning health, safety, welfare,
aesthetics, and orderly planning of the community.
C. The City has experienced an increased demand for wireless services facilities to be located in
the City and expects the increased demand to continue into the future.
D. It is in the best interests of the City to have quality wireless services available, which necessarily
entails the erection of wireless services facilities in the City.
E. The unnecessary proliferation of wireless services facilities throughout the City creates a
negative visual impact on the community.
F. The visual effects of wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their
sitting, construction, maintenance and use.
G. The City and other government entities own parcels of property spread throughout the City where
wireless services facilities can be located so as to be as inoffensive as possible to the residents
and businesses of the City.
H. Spacing wireless services facilities evenly throughout the city reduces the negative impact
created by the proliferation of telecommunication towers.

I. Because of the height and appearance of some wireless services facilities, surrounding
properties bear a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of a telecommunications tower.
J. A private property owner who leases space for a wireless services facility is the only one who
receives compensation for the facility, even though numerous other property owners in the area
are adversely affected by the location of the facility.
K. Encouraging wireless services facilities to be located on City and Government property, with
lease payments paid to the City or other Governments instead of an individual property owner,
indirectly compensates all citizens of the community for the adverse impacts of the facilities and
is therefore the fairest method of distributing burden and benefit.
L. Locating antennas on existing buildings and structures, or constructing an antenna as a stealth
facility, creates less of a negative visual impact on the community than the erection of towers.
M. Buildings and structures on public property are capable of being used to provide support for
antenna arrays, thus reducing the proliferation of towers in all areas of the City.
N. The public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to
mitigate their impact can best be facilitated by encouraging the use of less visually intrusive
antennas and permitting the locating of wireless communication systems on telecommunication
towers and antenna support structures that are located on property owned, leased, or used by
the City or other Governments.
O. The requirements set forth in this ordinance for the placement of wireless services facilities on
property owned, leased or used by the City or other Governments are necessary to protect the
health, safety and general welfare of the community.
P. The Utah Code grants cities the authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the erection
of telecommunication towers in order to promote the location of telecommunication towers in a
manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area. The law also allows
the City to require the owner of any tower to accommodate the multiple use of the tower by other
companies where feasible and to pay the City or other Governments the fair market rental value
for the use of any City or other Government-owned site.

Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, including FCC
radio frequency regulations, at the time of application and periodically thereafter as
