2.125.020    Public records index order.

2.125.030    Purpose.

2.125.040    Public records officer.

2.125.100    Review of denials of public records requests.

2.125.110    Exemptions provided by other statutes.


2.125.010 Authority, purpose and findings.

A. Authority. RCW 42.56.070(1) requires the city to make available for inspection and copying nonexempt public records in accordance with published rules. The Public Records Act (“the Act”) under RCW 42.56.010 defines “public record” to include any “writing containing information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.”

B. Purpose of Rules. The purpose of these rules is to establish the procedures the city of Raymond (“the city”) will follow in order to provide full access to public records, fullest assistance to inquirers and the most timely possible action as required by RCW 42.56.100, mindful of the further requirement that the rules must also protect the records from damage or disorganization and prevent excessive interference with other essential functions of the city.

These rules provide information to persons wishing to request access to public records of the city and establish processes for both requestors and city staff that are designed to best assist members of the public in obtaining such access.

C. Findings Re: Index.

1. RCW 42.56.070(1) requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of various public records. RCW 42.56.070(4) provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, a city need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

2. The city of Raymond is comprised of many departments which maintain separate databases and/or record keeping systems. The city produces or receives many records each day. The records are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and multiple computer systems and databases. It would be extremely difficult, unduly burdensome, and would interfere with city operations to compile and maintain a central index of records.

3. The development and maintenance of a city index would be extremely costly and would provide little benefit to the public compared to the expense in maintaining the index. The city’s operations do not allow for the addition, revision, or reassignment of duties of existing personnel so that an index may be developed and maintained. Anticipated city revenues do not allow for additional staff for the purpose of creating and maintaining such an index. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.020 Public records index order.

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4), the city council orders the following:

A. The city of Raymond is not required to maintain a current index of public records due to findings of the city council that the requirement to do so is unduly burdensome and would interfere with city operations and such a list is nearly impossible to create and/or maintain; and

B. Pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW, the city of Raymond shall disclose all public records and any indexes of public records maintained by the city to the extent not exempt from disclosure pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW or other applicable laws. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedure for obtaining public records from the city of Raymond as required by Chapter 42.56 RCW as currently enacted or hereafter amended. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.040 Public records officer.

Any person wishing to request access to public records of the city, or seeking assistance in making such a request, should follow the procedures set forth in these rules and contact the public records officer (the “PRO”) of the city to submit such a request or to obtain assistance in making such a request:

Clerk/Treasurer

City of Raymond

230 Second Street

Raymond, WA 98577

Phone (360) 942-4100

Fax (360) 942-4137

Email g_sagen.raymond@willapabay.org

The PRO shall complete training as required by RCW 42.56.152 on the Public Records Act (Chapter 42.56 RCW) and records retention (Chapter 40.14 RCW). This training is required after the PRO assumes responsibilities and under the schedule in RCW 42.56.152 for refresher courses. Information is also available at the city’s website at www.cityofraymond.com. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.050 Processing of public records requests.

A. Providing “Fullest Assistance.” Mindful of the requirements of RCW 42.56.100, to the extent reasonably possible, the PRO will process requests in the order allowing the most requests to be processed in the most efficient manner. In an effort to better understand the request and provide all responsive records, the PRO can inquire about the purpose for the request, but the requestor is not required to answer except to establish whether inspection and copying would violate RCW 42.56.070(9) (see subsection (E) of this section) or other statute which exempts or prohibits production of specific information or records to certain persons.

B. Acknowledging Receipt of Request. Within five business days of receipt of the request, not including the day the request was received, the weekend or holiday as provided by RCW 1.12.040, the PRO will do one or more of the following:

1. Make the records available for inspection or copying;

2. If copies are requested and payment or payment of a deposit is made as provided in RMC 2.125.090, or terms of payment are agreed upon, send the copies to the requestor;

3. Provide a reasonable estimate of any additional time needed to respond to the request and a date by which the records will be produced in whole or in part depending on whether the records are being provided in installments. The factors used to estimate the additional time needed must be based upon objective criteria. Additional time is allowed under the following circumstances:

a. To request clarification from the requestor if the request is unclear or does not sufficiently identify the requested records. Such clarification may be requested and provided by telephone. If the clarification is made by telephone, the PRO will confirm the scope of the clarification in writing. The confirmation will be deemed the correct statement of the scope of the request unless the requestor responds with a supplemental request;

b. To locate and assemble the information requested;

c. To notify third persons or agencies in the event the requested records contain information that may affect rights of others and may be exempt from production; or

d. To determine whether any of the information requested is exempt from production and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request; or

4. Deny or redact the request, specifying the reasons for denial or redaction, including supporting legal citations.

C. Failure to Respond.

1. By the PRO. If the PRO does not respond in writing within five business days of receipt of the request for disclosure, the requestor should consider contacting the PRO to determine the reason for the failure to respond.

2. By the Requestor. If the requestor fails to respond to an agency request to clarify the request, and the entire record is unclear, the city need not respond to it. Otherwise, the city must respond to those portions of the request that are clear.

D. Injunction. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.565, the city may seek to enjoin the inspection or copying of any nonexempt public record by persons serving criminal sentences in state, local, or privately operated correctional facilities.

E. Records Exempt from Production. Some records are exempt from production, in whole or in part. If a record is exempt from production and subject to denial, the PRO will state the specific exemption and provide a brief explanation of the denial and how the exemption applies to the record being withheld. This explanation should be sufficient to enable the requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption and denial are proper. If only a portion of a record is exempt from production, but the remainder is not exempt, the PRO will redact the exempt portions, produce the nonexempt portions, and indicate to the requestor why portions of the record are being redacted. (For the purposes of these rules, “redact” means the exempt information will be covered in some manner and then the record will be photocopied and the photocopy then disclosed.)

Some records by law require third party notification or consent. The PRO will notify the requestor of the notification or consent requirement and add sufficient time to the estimated response time.

The city is also prohibited by statute from producing lists of individuals for commercial purposes. Therefore, if a request is received for any type of list of individuals, an inquiry as to whether the requestor intends to use the list for commercial purposes must be answered before the list can be provided. If the answer is that it will be used for such purposes, the list cannot be produced.

F. Inspection of Records.

1. Consistent with other demands, the city shall promptly provide space to inspect public records. No member of the public may remove a document from the viewing area or disassemble or alter any document. The requestor shall indicate which documents he or she wishes the city to copy or scan, if any, and provide payment for those copies or scans.

2. The requestor must claim or review the assembled records within 30 days of the PRO’s notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying/scanning. The PRO will notify the requestor, in writing, of this requirement and inform the requestor that he or she should contact the PRO to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the 30-day period or make other arrangements, the PRO may close the request and re-file the assembled records. Other public records requests can be processed ahead of a subsequent request by the same person for the same or almost identical records, which can be processed as a new request.

G. Providing Records in Installments. When the request is for a large number of records, the PRO may provide access for inspection and copying in installments, if he or she reasonably determines that it would be practical to provide the records in that manner. If, within 30 days, the requestor fails to inspect the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the PRO may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request.

H. Closing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request. When the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to fulfill his or her obligations to inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for the requested copies, the PRO will close the request and so inform the requestor.

I. Later Discovered Documents. If, after the PRO has informed the requestor that he or she has provided all available records, the PRO becomes aware of additional responsive documents existing at the time of the request that had not been provided previously, he or she will promptly inform the requestor of the additional documents and provide them on an expedited basis.

J. Requests for Information or Nonexistent Records. Requests for information are not public records requests. An agency is not required to conduct legal research for a requestor. An agency is not required to create records to respond to a request. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.060 Processing of public records requests – Electronic records.

A. Requesting Electronic Records. The process for requesting electronic public records is the same as for requesting paper public records.

B. Providing Electronic Records. If public records are requested in an electronic format, the PRO will provide the nonexempt records or portions of such records that are reasonably locatable in an electronic format that is used by the agency and is generally commercially available, or in a format that is reasonably translatable from the format in which the agency keeps the record. Costs for providing electronic records are governed by RMC 2.125.090.

C. Retaining Electronic Copies. Because an electronic record is usually more susceptible to manipulation and alteration than a paper record, the city will keep, when feasible, an electronic copy of the electronic records it provides to a requestor to be able to show the exact records it provided if necessary. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.070 Public records requests.

A. Any person wishing to inspect or copy public records of the city should make the request in writing on the city’s request form, attached as Exhibit A to the ordinance codified in this chapter, or by letter, fax, or email addressed to the PRO and including the following information:

Name of requestor; address of requestor; other contact information, including telephone number and any email address; identification of the public records adequate for the PRO to locate the records; and the date and time of day of the request.

B. A public record request must be for identifiable records. A request for all or substantially all records prepared, owned, used, or retained by an agency is not a valid request for identifiable records; provided, that a request for all records regarding a particular topic or containing a particular keyword or name shall not be considered a request for all of the city’s records.

C. If the requestor wishes to have copies or scans of the records made instead of simply inspecting them, he or she should so indicate and make arrangements with the PRO to pay for copies or scans of the records as provided in RMC 2.125.090.

D. A form is available for use by requestors at the office of the PRO and online at: www.cityofraymond.com.

E. Public records requests are public records and subject to inspection or copying.

F. The PRO shall accept requests for public records that contain the above information by telephone or in person. The PRO will confirm receipt of the information and the substance of the request in writing. The confirmation will be deemed the correct statement of the scope of the request unless the requestor responds with a different statement of the scope.

G. Records requests may only include existing records. They cannot be used to obtain copies of records not yet in existence.

H. The city may deny a bot request that is one of multiple requests from the requestor to the agency within a 24-hour period, if the city establishes that responding to the multiple requests would cause excessive interference with other essential functions of the city. A “bot” request means a request for public records that the city reasonably believes was automatically generated by a computer program or script. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.080 Availability of public records.

A. Availability. Public records are available for inspection and copying during normal business hours of the city, Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., excluding legal holidays. Inspection of records shall occur at the central offices of the city unless another location is approved by the PRO or designee.

B. Organization of Records. The city will maintain its records in a reasonably organized manner. While committed to fully comply with the Act and these rules, the city must also take reasonable actions to protect records from damage and disorganization and prevent excessive interference with other essential functions of the city. A requestor shall not take city records from city offices. A variety of records are available on the city’s website at www.cityofraymond.com.

Requestors are encouraged to view the documents available on the website prior to submitting a records request. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.090 Costs of providing copies of public records.

A. No fee will be charged for the inspection of public records or locating public records and making them available for copying, except as described in RCW 52.56.120(3).

B. The city shall charge the following costs for providing copies of public records:

1. Fifteen cents per page for photocopies of public records, printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person requesting records, or for the use of city equipment to photocopy public records;

2. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to scan the records;

3. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service or other means of electronic delivery;

4. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to send the records electronically. The city shall take reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner available to the agency in its normal operations;

5. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the city, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.

C. The charges in subsection (B) of this section may be combined to the extent that more than one type of charge applies to copies produced in response to a particular request.

D. The city may charge a flat fee of up to $2.00 for any request as an alternative to fees authorized under subsection (B) of this section when the city reasonably estimates and documents that the costs allowed under this subsection are clearly equal to or more than $2.00. An additional flat fee shall not be charged for any installment after the first installment of a request produced in installments. If the city has elected to charge the flat fee in this subsection for an initial installment, it may not charge the fees authorized in subsection (B) of this section on subsequent installments.

E. The city shall not impose copying charges under this section for access to or downloading of records that the city routinely posts on its website prior to receipt of a request, unless the requestor has specifically requested that the city provide copies of such records through other means.

F. A requestor may ask the city to provide and, if requested, the city shall provide a summary of the applicable charge before any copies are made and the requestor may revise the request to reduce the number of copies to be made and reduce the applicable charges.

G. The city may include a customized service charge, as allowed by RCW 42.56.120(3).

H. The city may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request. If the city makes a request available on a partial or installment basis, the city may charge for each part of the request as it is provided. If an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the city is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. The city may waive any charge assessed for a request pursuant to city rules and regulations. The city may enter into any contract, memorandum of understanding or other agreement with a requestor that provides an alternative fee arrangement to the charges authorized in this section, or in response to a voluminous or frequently occurring request.

I. The PRO will not charge sales tax when it makes copies or scans of public records but if the records are sent to a third party for copying/scanning, that third party may charge sales tax and the requestor will be responsible for payment of that tax as well as the third party’s actual charges for copies or scans.

J. Payment. Payment may be made by cash, check, or money order made payable to the city.

K. Other Copying Charges. The Act generally governs copying charges for public records, but several specific statutes govern charges for particular kinds of records. The following nonexhaustive list provides some examples: RCW 46.52.085 (charges for traffic accident reports); RCW 10.97.100 (copies of criminal histories) and RCW 70.58.107 (charges for birth certificates). The city will charge the amount authorized pursuant to these other statutes rather than as provided under the Act.

L. Use of Outside Vendor. An agency is not required to copy/scan records at its own facilities. An agency can send the project to a commercial copying/scanning center and bill the requestor for the amount charged by the vendor. An agency can arrange with the requestor to pay the vendor directly. An agency cannot charge the default per page copying/scanning charge when its cost at a vendor is less. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.100 Review of denials of public records requests.

A. Internal Administrative Review of Denial of Access. If the city makes a denial or partial denial of a records request, the city shall immediately conduct an internal review of that decision. The denial or partial denial shall be immediately sent to the city attorney, who shall consult with the city administrator on the decision.

B. Consideration of Petition for Review. The denial or partial denial shall be deemed complete at the end of the second business day following the denial or partial denial of inspection, and shall constitute final agency action.

C. Judicial Review. Any person may obtain court review of: the city’s denials or partial denial of public records requests; or the reasonableness of the estimate of the amount of time provided by the city; or the reasonableness of the city’s estimate of the charges to produce copies of public records, as provided in RCW 42.56.550. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 2017)


2.125.110 Exemptions provided by other statutes.

A. Exemptions. RCW 42.56.070(2) requires the city to set forth “for informational purposes” every law, in addition to the Act, that exempts or prohibits the production of public records.

At the clerk’s discretion, businesses may be assigned to a quarterly or annual reporting period depending on the tax amount owing or type of tax. Tax payments are due on or before the last day of the next month following the end of the assigned reporting period covered by the return (April 30th, July 31st, October 31st, or January 31st).

G. If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to make a return as and when required in this chapter, the clerk is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the clerk’s estimate of the tax or fees due. Such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the city by the taxpayer. The clerk shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable.

H. Any business that fails to report for two consecutive quarters shall have their business license revoked. (Ord. 1689 § 1, 2004)

A. Taxes shall be paid to the clerk in United States currency by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, personal check, money order, cash, or by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic payment is authorized by the clerk. If payment so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered, shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the same as if such payment had not been tendered. Acceptance of any sum by the clerk shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.

B. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the city by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the post office upon the envelope containing it. The clerk may allow electronic filing of returns or remittances from any taxpayer. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the city electronically shall be deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the clerk.

C. If a written request is received prior to the due date, the clerk, for good cause, may grant, in writing, additional time within which to make and file returns.

D. The clerk shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received or refunded. The clerk shall apply payments first against all penalties and interest owing, and then upon the tax, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer.

E. For any return not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and shall be subject to the penalties and interest provided in this chapter.

F. Any payment made that is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for any other reason will not be considered received until payment by certified check, money order, or cash of the original amount due, plus a “non-sufficient funds” (NSF) charge of $20.00 is received by the clerk. Any license issued upon payment with an NSF check will be considered void, and shall be returned to the clerk. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the $20.00 NSF fee) is received.

G. The clerk is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or fees, when and as due under this chapter. (Ord. 1689 § 1, 2004)

All books, records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other data including federal income tax and state tax returns and reports shall be open for examination at any time by the clerk or his/her duly authorized agent. Every person’s business premises shall be open for inspection or examination by the clerk or a duly authorized agent.

The clerk is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the taxpayer. The clerk shall notify the taxpayer by mail the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable.

Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

B. The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying for, or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the clerk discovers that a refund or credit is due.

C. Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the clerk and by the issuance of a city check or warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the city may provide.

D. If the clerk finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the clerk a license as required by RMC 3.15.025, the clerk shall impose a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(4), as it now exists or as it may be amended. No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection (D) if the person who engaged in business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the clerk of the need to be licensed.

E. If the clerk determines that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from the taxpayer’s failure to follow specific written tax reporting instructions, there shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(5), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

F. If the clerk finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable, the clerk shall assess a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(6), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

I. For the purposes of this section, “return” means any document a person is required by the city of Raymond to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the city, and that has a statutorily defined due date.

J. If incorporation into the city of Raymond code of future changes to RCW 82.32.090 is deemed invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.090 existing at the time the ordinance codified in this section is effective shall apply. (Ord. 1739 § 4, 2007; Ord. 1689 § 1, 2004)


3.15.120 Cancellation of penalties.

A. The clerk may cancel any penalties imposed under RMC 3.15.110(A) if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Willful neglect is presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was, nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, unable to file or pay by the due date.

B. A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the clerk within 30 days after the date the city mails the notice that the penalties are due.

B. Any person who becomes a successor shall become liable for the full amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the city from the taxpayer until such time as: (1) the taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the city showing payment in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due, or (2) more than six months have passed since the successor notified the clerk of the acquisition and the clerk has not issued and notified the successor of an assessment.

C. Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the taxpayer.

D. Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the clerk of the acquisition and the city does not, within six months of the date it received the notice, issue an assessment against the taxpayer and mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be liable for the tax. (Ord. 1689 § 1, 2004)

A $75.00 filing fee shall be submitted with the appeal, which filing fee is required to process the appeal.

3.16.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the city’s authority to license for revenue as authorized by Article XI, Section 12 of the Washington State Constitution and RCW 35A.11.020. (Ord. 1887, 2019)


3.16.020 Exercise of revenue license power.

The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the power of the city to license for revenue. The provisions of this chapter are subject to periodic statutory or administrative rule changes or judicial interpretations of the ordinances or rules. The responsibility rests with the licensee or taxpayer to reconfirm tax computation procedures and remain in compliance with the city code. (Ord. 1887, 2019)


3.16.028 Administrative provisions.

The administrative provisions contained in RMC Title 2 shall be fully applicable to the provisions of this chapter except as expressly stated to the contrary herein. (Ord. 1887, 2019)


3.16.030 Definitions.

In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall be applied. Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular.

“Business” includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the taxpayer or to another person or class, directly or indirectly.

“Business and occupation tax” or “gross receipts tax” means a tax imposed on or measured by the value of products, the gross income of the business, or the gross proceeds of sales, as the case may be, and that is the legal liability of the business.

“City” shall mean the city of Raymond.

“Clerk, “city clerk” or “clerk/treasurer” means the clerk/treasurer of the city or any officer, agent or employee of the city designated to act on the clerk’s behalf.

“Commercial or industrial use” means the following uses of products, including by-products, by the extractor or manufacturer thereof:

1. Any use as a consumer; and

2. The manufacturing of articles, substances or commodities.

“Delivery” means the transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the seller and the buyer or the buyer’s representative. Delivery to an employee of a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer’s representative first takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over the property. “Dominion and control” means the buyer has the ability to put the property to the buyer’s own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer’s representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property, and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer has no right to return the property to the seller, other than under a warranty contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to itself. A buyer’s representative is a person, other than an employee of the buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a buyer’s representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (RCW Title 62A) do not determine when or where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of taxation.

3.16.075 Deductions to prevent multiple taxation of manufacturing activities and prior to January 1, 2008, transactions involving more than one city with an eligible gross receipts tax.

A. Amounts Subject to an Eligible Gross Receipts Tax in Another City That Also Maintains Nexus Over the Same Activity. For taxes due prior to January 1, 2008, a taxpayer that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax on the same activity in more than one jurisdiction may be entitled to a deduction as follows:

1. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax, with respect to a sale of goods or services, to a jurisdiction in which the goods are delivered or the services are provided may deduct an amount equal to the gross receipts used to measure that tax from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

2. Notwithstanding the above, a person that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax in more than one jurisdiction on the gross income derived from intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall assign those gross receipts to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located).

3. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax on the privilege of accepting or executing a contract with another city may deduct an amount equal to the contract price used to measure the tax due to the other city from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

B. Person Manufacturing Products Within and Without. A person manufacturing products within the city using products manufactured by the same person outside the city may deduct from the measure of the manufacturing tax the value of products manufactured outside the city and included in the measure of an eligible gross receipts tax paid to the other jurisdiction with respect to manufacturing such products. (Ord. 1887, 2019)


3.16.076 Assignment of gross income derived from intangibles.

Gross income derived from the sale of intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall be assigned to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located). (Ord. 1887, 2019)


3.16.077 Allocation and apportionment of income when activities take place in more than one jurisdiction.

Gross income, other than persons subject to the provisions of Chapter 82.14A RCW, shall be allocated and apportioned as follows:

A. Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as service or royalties under RMC 3.16.050(A)(7) shall be allocated to the location where the activity takes place.

B. In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.

C. In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:

1. The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller’s place of business;

2. If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;

3. If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;

4. If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and

5. If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.

D. If none of the methods in subsection (C) of this section for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, then the city and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the city to use an alternative method under this subsection (D). The city may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section are not available and the taxpayer and the city are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.

E. For purposes of subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, the following definitions apply:

1. “Digital automated services,” “digital codes,” and “digital goods” have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.192;

2. “Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(c); and

3. “Receive” has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.730.

F. Gross income derived from activities taxed as services and other activities taxed under RMC 3.16.050(A) shall be apportioned to the city by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service income factor and the denominator of which is two.

1. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:

a. The individual is primarily assigned within the city;

b. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs 50 percent or more of his or her service for the tax period in the city; or

c. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform 50 percent or more of his or her service in any city and the employee resides in the city.

2. The service income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service income is in the city if the customer location is in the city.

3. Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service income factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the city, and the gross income is attributable under subsection (F)(2) of this section to a city or unincorporated area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (F)(3), “not taxable” means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under the standards in RCW 35.102.050 regardless of whether that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes such a tax.

4. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (F) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrators may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:

a. Separate accounting;

b. The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

c. The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; or

d. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

5. The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection (F)(4) of this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:

a. That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (F) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; and

b. That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable. The same burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

6. If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the tax administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (F).

7. A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.

G. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

1. “Apportionable income” means the gross income of the business taxable under the service classifications of a city’s gross receipts tax, including income received from activities outside the city if the income would be taxable under the service classification if received from activities within the city, less any exemptions or deductions available.

2. “Business activities tax” means a tax measured by the amount of, or economic results of, business activity conducted in a city or county within the United States or within a foreign country.

3. “Compensation” means wages, salaries, commissions, and any other form of remuneration paid to individuals for personal services that are or would be included in the individual’s gross income under the federal Internal Revenue Code.

4. “Customer” means a person or entity to whom the taxpayer makes a sale or renders services or from whom the taxpayer otherwise receives gross income of the business.

5. “Customer location” means the following:

a. For a customer not engaged in business, if the service requires the customer to be physically present, where the service is performed.

b. For a customer not engaged in business, if the service does not require the customer to be physically present:

i. The customer’s residence; or

ii. If the customer’s residence is not known, the customer’s billing/mailing address.

iii. At the customer’s commercial domicile if none of the above are known.

6. “Individual” means any individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee of that taxpayer.

7. “Primarily assigned” means the business location of the taxpayer where the individual performs his or her duties.

8. “Service-taxable income” or “service income” means gross income of the business subject to tax under either the service or royalty classification.

9. “Tax period” means the calendar year during which tax liability is accrued. If taxes are reported by a taxpayer on a basis more frequent than once per year, taxpayers shall calculate the factors for the previous calendar year for reporting in the current calendar year and correct the reporting for the previous year when the factors are calculated for that year, but not later than the end of the first quarter of the following year.

Notwithstanding RCW 35.102.130, gross income from the activities of printing and of publishing newspapers, periodicals, or magazines, shall be allocated to the principal place in this state from which the taxpayer’s business is directed or managed. As used in this section, the activities of printing and of publishing newspapers, periodicals, or magazines have the same meanings as attributed to those terms in RCW 82.04.280(1) by the Department of Revenue.

5.04.001 Purpose.

This chapter provides requirements specific to the issuance of a city of Raymond business license. General requirements stated in this chapter are also applicable to other licenses issued by the city under other chapters of this or other titles of the Raymond Municipal Code unless specifically stated otherwise in such other respective chapters.

The city intends that all business activity in the city of Raymond be licensed and that business activities generating more than certain minimum amounts be taxed. (Ord. 1890, 2020)


5.04.005 Definitions.

“Business” means and includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the taxpayer or to another person or class, directly or indirectly and whether conducted from a commercial or residential location within the city, or from a location found outside the limits of the city.

“Business Licensing Service” or “BLS” means the office within the Washington State Department of Revenue providing business licensing services to the city.

“City” means the city of Raymond, Washington.

Engaging in Business.

1. The term “engaging in business” means commencing, conducting, or continuing in business, and also the exercise of corporate or franchise powers, as well as liquidating a business when the liquidators thereof hold themselves out to the public as conducting such business.

2. This definition sets forth examples of activities that constitute engaging in business in the city. It also establishes safe harbors for certain of those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimis business activities in the city without having to pay a business license fee. The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business” in subsection (1) of this definition. If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the city shall be determined by considering all the facts, circumstances, and applicable law.

3. Without being all-inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted for business purposes within the city by a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker, or another acting on its behalf, constitutes engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business license:

a. Owning, renting, leasing, maintaining, or having the right to use, or using, tangible personal property, intangible personal property, or real property permanently or temporarily located in the city.

b. Owning, renting, leasing, using, or maintaining an office, place of business, or other establishment in the city.

c. Soliciting sales.

d. Making repairs or providing maintenance or service to real or tangible personal property, including warranty work and property maintenance.

e. Providing technical assistance or service, including quality control, product inspections, warranty work, or similar services, on or in connection with tangible personal property sold by the person or on its behalf.

f. Installing, constructing, or supervising installation or construction of real or tangible personal property.

g. Soliciting, negotiating, or approving franchise, license, or other similar agreements.

h. Collecting current or delinquent accounts.

i. Picking up and transporting tangible personal property, solid waste, construction debris, or excavated materials.

j. Providing disinfecting and pest control services, employment and labor pool services, home nursing care, janitorial services, appraising, landscape architectural services, security system services, surveying, and real estate services including the listing of homes and managing real property.

k. Rendering professional services such as those provided by accountants, architects, attorneys, auctioneers, consultants, engineers, professional athletes, barbers, baseball clubs and other sports organizations, chemists, psychologists, court reporters, dentists, doctors, detectives, laboratory operators, teachers, and veterinarians.

l. Meeting with customers or potential customers, even when no sales or orders are solicited at the meetings.

m. Training or recruiting agents, representatives, independent contractors, brokers or others, domiciled or operating on a job in the city, acting on its behalf, or for customers or potential customers.

n. Investigating, resolving, or otherwise assisting in resolving customer complaints.

o. In-store stocking or manipulating products or goods sold to and owned by a customer, regardless of where sale and delivery of the goods took place.

p. Delivering goods in vehicles owned, rented, leased, used, or maintained by the person or another acting on its behalf.

4. If a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker or another acting on the person’s behalf, engages in no other activities in or with the city but the following, it need not register and obtain a business license:

a. Meeting with suppliers of goods and services as a customer.

b. Meeting with government representatives in their official capacity, other than those performing contracting or purchasing functions.

d. Renting tangible or intangible property as a customer when the property is not used in the city.

e. Attending, but not participating in, a “trade show” or “multiple vendor events.” Persons participating at a trade show shall review the city’s trade show or multiple vendor event ordinances.

f. Conducting advertising through the mail.

5. A seller located outside the city merely delivering goods into the city by means of common carrier is not required to register and obtain a business license; provided, that it engages in no other business activities in the city other than those listed in subsection (4) of this definition.

The city expressly intends that engaging in business includes any activity sufficient to establish nexus for purposes of applying the license fee under the law and the Constitutions of the United States and the state of Washington. Nexus is presumed to continue as long as the taxpayer benefits from the activity that constituted the original nexus generating contact or subsequent contacts. (Ord. 1890, 2020)


5.04.010 License required – Display.

Every person, firm, corporation, or other form of business organization must, before engaging in any business in the city, obtain a license to do so from the city, to be known as a business license.

If a person conducts business in multiple permanent locations in the city, the person must obtain a separate license for each such location as provided for in this chapter, provided only one license is required for each location regardless of multiple business activities conducted by the same person at a location. In the event two or more persons each conduct their own business at the same location, each such person must obtain their own license for their respective business.

When the place of business of a taxpayer is to be changed, the taxpayer must notify the Business Licensing Service sufficiently before the change to allow the city clerk to review and approve the location change prior to business being conducted at the new place of business. A change of location may require submitting a new application for a business license as provided for in this chapter. No person may engage in any business for which a business license is required under this chapter without being registered and licensed in compliance with the provisions of this chapter; nor may any person holding such business license allow any other person, for whom a separate license is required, to operate under or display his or her license.

For purposes of the business license required by this chapter, any person or business whose annual value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of business in the city is equal to or less than $2,000 and who does not maintain a place of business within the city must submit a business license registration and be licensed, but will not be charged a license fee.

(Ord. 1890, 2020)


5.04.020 License fee.

The city license fee shall be as follows:

	1 to 10 full-time employees (FTE)	$100

	More than 10 full-time employees (FTE)	 

$200

	Business with annual value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business in the city equal to or less than $2,000 and does not maintain a place of business in the city	No Fee

FTE: Full-time employee equivalents are based on the total hours reported to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries in the previous year for all paid employees, divided by 2,080 hours. Fractions must be rounded to the next nearest whole number, but in any event may not be counted as less than one FTE.

For businesses not maintaining a permanent place of business in the city, and for which the annual value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business in the city is greater than $2,000, the city license fee will be determined under the FTE calculation described in this section, provided only the employee hours worked inside the city will be counted in that calculation for the city business license fee. (Ord. 1890, 2020)


5.04.030 Expiration – Revocation conditions.

The business license issued under this chapter expires on the date established by the Business Licensing Service, and must be renewed on or before that date to continue engaging in business in the city. All other licenses issued by the city under other chapters of this or other titles of the Raymond Municipal Code expire on the thirty-first day of December of the year in which they were issued, or on another date as may be specified in such other chapters or titles.

B. The city may cause the removal of all or part of any dead, dangerous, or diseased tree when the tree constitutes a hazard to life, property, or harbors insects or disease which constitutes a potential threat to other trees.

C. The city may approve the removal of trees on public rights-of-way for work conducted by or on behalf of a federal, state, county, municipal, or other governmental agency in pursuance of its lawful activities or functions in the construction, improvement, or maintenance of public rights-of-way. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.050 Enforcing authority.

The administrator shall be charged with the enforcement of this chapter. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.060 Planting standards.

A. General Provisions. The selection of street trees will be in accordance with the “City of Raymond Street Tree Plan,” attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Exhibit A. Street tree plantings shall consider the location of existing utilities, lighting, driveways, business entrances, and signs.

B. Planting Season. The time of year a tree is planted can greatly affect the tree’s establishment because newly planted trees require water to survive and grow. Planting during the wet, cool months will help ensure tree establishment and survival. Therefore, the planting season in the city is designated as October 1st through April 30th.

C. Tree Spacing. Trees should be planted a minimum distance of 25 feet apart, except in special plantings approved by the city.

D. Tree Vaults. Tree vault sizes shall be a minimum of four feet wide by four feet long.

E. Distance from Curb and Sidewalk. The distance trees may be planted from curbs or curb lines and sidewalks will be determined by the city on a street-by-street basis; every effort will be made to promote continuity and uniformity per each street but not necessarily city wide. On streets that do not have curbs and/or sidewalks, or planters designed for public tree placement, the city shall approve the location of new trees consistent with street and sidewalk construction standards.

F. Distance from Street Corners, Business Entrances, Traffic Signs, and Fire Hydrants. No street tree shall be planted closer than 20 feet from any street corner, measured from the nearest intersection curb or curb line point. Trees should not be planted in building entrances, within 20 feet from the front of stop signs or other directional and safety signs such as yield, pedestrian crossing, school, speed limit, etc., or within 10 feet from a fire hydrant.

G. Utilities. No street tree, other than small trees, may be planted under or within 10 lateral feet of any overhead utility wire, or over or within five lateral feet of any underground water line, transmission line, or other utility.

H. Requirements for New Street Trees. Trees shall be grown and harvested in accordance with the standards in the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1-2014 or most current edition). Trees acquired for planting in the city right-of-way shall be nursery-grown in a USDA hardiness zone suitable for the region and shall exhibit the following characteristics:

1. Healthy and vigorous, with trunk and limbs free from insects, disease, defects, injuries, and decay;

2. Single trunk that is straight, with a well-developed leader and good trunk taper (one-and-one-half-inch to two-inch caliper);

3. Well-distributed branches that are considerably smaller in diameter than the trunk, with wide-angled branch attachments or branch attachments that are appropriate for the tree form; and

4. A fibrous root system.

I. Root Barriers. It is ideal to plant the right tree in the right place to reduce tree conflicts, but the right-of-way is not often an ideal place for a tree to grow due to narrow space, compacted soil, and hard surfaces such as sidewalks. Tree roots can grow underneath sidewalks and lift or crack the sidewalk. Damaged sidewalks create safety concerns and are expensive to replace, and trees that cause infrastructure damage can become less desirable to retain through the end of their natural lifespan. This means planting small trees in small spaces and big trees in big spaces. However, extra protection can be taken by installing root barriers at the time of planting. A root barrier is a device installed in the ground, between a tree and the sidewalk, intended to guide roots down and away from the sidewalk to prevent sidewalk lifting from tree roots. Root barriers are required to be installed in conjunction with street tree plantings, unless specifically exempted by the city.

1. Root barriers shall be commercially produced for deflecting tree roots downward. Root barriers shall be installed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Root guide ridges shall face towards the tree, with the back flush against the sidewalk. The top of the root barrier shall be one-half to one inch above the finished soil grade or level with the sidewalk, whichever is lower, when installation is complete;

2. Root barriers should generally be made of polypropylene, polyethylene, or polystyrene, at least 12 inches deep, with vertical root guides every six inches. Root barrier products should specify use as a tree root barrier; and

3. Alternative root barrier materials may be used when approved by the city.

J. Tree Grates. Tree grates shall be used to reduce trip hazards and assist in keeping sidewalks neat and clean. Grates will be placed so they are even with the walking surface of the sidewalk. When an individual planting area is not symmetrical, the longer dimension shall run along the curb. When there is on-street parking, a tree grate or a paved walk 18 inches wide behind the curb are encouraged to help avoid conflicts with car doors and foot traffic. A minimum clear pedestrian walking path of four feet, as required by the RMC, shall be maintained. Where tree grates are used, they shall be ADA accessible and have a similar size and material as tree grates found in adjacent streets. Grates can be:

1. Poured and framed during sidewalk construction for insertion of a metal grate;

2. Hand placed pavers or similar material; or

3. Of other similar material as approved by the city. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.070 Abuse of trees prohibited.

No person shall abuse, destroy, or mutilate any street tree, or attach or place any rope or wire (other than one used to support the tree itself), sign, poster, handbill, or other thing to, or on any tree growing in a public place, or cause or permit any wire charged with electricity with the exception of decorative lights for a period not exceeding 45 days per year, to come into contact with any such tree, or to allow any gaseous, liquid, or solid substance which is harmful to such trees, to come into contact with their roots or leaves. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.080 Interference with city.

No person shall prevent, delay, or interfere with the city or any of its agents, while engaging in the planting, cultivating, mulching, pruning, spraying, or removal of any street trees. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.090 Emergency tree maintenance.

Emergency tree maintenance procedures are authorized to be performed by utility companies, contractors, abutting property owners, and the city, when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances or conditions that impose an immediate threat to utility systems, public or private property, or the welfare of persons residing or traveling near the tree in question. Only the work required to remove the immediate threat shall be performed. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.100 Exceptions.

Anyone with an ownership interest in land may request an exception from the provisions of this chapter based on special circumstances pertaining to that land or the trees on it. Such requests shall be addressed in writing or in person, with full documentation and justification, to the city council. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.110 Appeals.

Appeals, to a decision of the administrator made under this chapter, will be filed within 15 days of the final decision, to the city council. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)


12.30.120 Violation – Penalties.

Any person, firm, or corporation responsible for removing a street tree or park tree without the approval of the city, or under an exemption hereunder, shall pay the full value times two, as determined by the city, of the tree that was removed, to the city to be dedicated to the maintenance and replacement of street trees. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction or a plea of guilty, be subject to a fine of not more than $500.00. All fines collected shall be set aside for the planting, maintenance, and enhancement of street and park trees. The foregoing penalty provisions hereof shall be in addition to any remedies provided by laws of the state. (Ord. 1871 § 1, 2018)

Such entry shall be made on the margin of the assessment roll opposite the description of the property. (1958 code § 6.24.080)


13.12.100 Redemption by former owner – Procedure – Time limit.

A. Any property so sold for an assessment shall be subject to redemption by the former owner, or his grantee, mortgagee, heir or other representative, at any time within two years from the date of the sale, upon the payment to the clerk/treasurer for the purchaser of the amount for which the same was sold, with interest at the rate of 15 percent per year, together with all taxes and special assessments, interest, penalties, costs and other charges thereon paid by the purchaser of such property at or since such sale, with like interest thereon. Unless written notice of taxes and assessments subsequently paid, and the amount thereof, shall be deposited with the city clerk/treasurer, redemption may be made without including the same. On any such redemption being made, the clerk/treasurer shall give to the redemptioner a certificate of redemption therefor, and pay over the amount so received to the purchaser of the certificates of sale or his assigns.

B. Should no redemption be made within such period of two years, the clerk/treasurer shall, on demand of the purchaser or his assigns, and the surrender to him of the certificate of sale, execute to such purchaser or his assigns a deed to the property therein described; provided, that no such deed shall be executed until the holder of such certificate of sale shall have notified the owners of such property that he holds such certificates, and that he will demand a deed therefor. The notice shall be given by personal service upon the owners; provided, that in case the parties are nonresidents of the state or cannot be found therein after diligent search, then the notice may be given by publication in the official newspaper of the city, once a week for three consecutive weeks.

C. If, notwithstanding such notice, no redemption is made within 60 days after the date of service, or the date of first publication of such notice, the holder of such certificate of sale shall be entitled to a deed thereon. Such deed shall be executed only for the property described in the certificate, and after payment of all delinquent taxes and special assessments thereon or installments thereof, and certificates of delinquency or other certificates issued for special local assessments, whether the same was levied, assessed or issued prior or subsequent to the issuance of the certificates of sale; provided, that any deed may be issued to the city for the face of the amount for which the certificate of sale was issued plus accrued interest, costs, penalties and charges, and shall be held by the city, subject to the liens of general taxes and special assessments. (1958 code § 6.24.100)


13.12.110 Failure to redeem property – Deed to holder of certificate of sale.

The deed shall be executed in the name of the city of Raymond, shall recite in substance the matters contained in the certificate of sale, the notice to the owner, and that no redemption has been made of the property within the time allowed by law. The deed shall be signed and acknowledged by the city clerk/treasurer, as such, and shall be prima facie evidence that the property was assessed according to and as required by law; that the assessment was not paid; that the property was sold as required by law; that it was not redeemed, that due notice of demand for deed has been given, and that the person executing the deed was the proper office; and the deed shall be conclusive evidence of the regularity of all other proceedings from the assessment, up to and including the execution of the deed, and shall convey the entire fee-simple title to the property therein described, except as otherwise provided herein for the city, stripped of all liens and claims except assessments for local improvements or installments thereof not delinquent.

Such sale shall be had upon notice giving a description of the property sold, that the clerk/treasurer will sell such property on the day specified in the notice at the front door of the building in which the city council holds its sessions, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., and continue such sale from day to day, Sundays and legal holidays excepted; or the clerk/treasurer may withdraw such property from sale after the first day if such course is deemed for the best interests of the city. Such notice shall be published two times in the official paper of the city and 15 days shall elapse between the date of last publication of such notice and the day of sale. (1958 code § 6.24.090)


13.12.130 Certificate of delinquency – Issuance conditions – Deemed interest-bearing lien.

A. The city council may, in its discretion, if it deems it for the best interests of the city, authorize the clerk/treasurer to issue certificates of delinquency for any and all delinquent assessments or installments thereof heretofore or hereafter levied, and any penalty and interest thereon to date of issuance. Such certificate of delinquency shall constitute a lien against the property upon which such assessments were levied, and shall bear interest from the date of the issuance thereof at the rate of 15 percent per year, and may be foreclosed after two years from the date of their issuance in the same manner and with the same effect as mortgages upon real estate are foreclosed. Such certificates may be issued to the city, or may be sold to any person applying therefor. They may be assigned in writing, and the city may sell and assign any and all certificates which may be issued to it upon the payment of the value thereof in principal and accrued interest, in cash. Such certificates shall be prima facie evidence that the land against which the same was issued was subject to the assessment at the time the same was assessed, as required by law, and that the assessment or installment thereof was not paid prior to the issuance of such certificate.

B. No such certificate of delinquency shall be issued upon any property for any assessment or installment thereof during the pendency of any proceeding in court affecting such assessment. If any certificate of delinquency covering any property upon which there are unpaid and delinquent assessments or installments are not sold, then the city council may authorize a sale of the property by the city clerk/treasurer, as hereinbefore in this chapter provided. (1958 code § 6.24.110)


13.12.140 Delinquent assessments – Collection and enforcement.

The city council, in its discretion, if it deems it for the best interests of the city, may authorize an action for the collection and enforcement of any delinquent assessments or delinquent installments in the superior court of Pacific County, in accordance with Section 34 of Chapter 98 of the Session Laws of 1911 (Chapter 35.50 RCW). Any method that may be decided upon by the city council for the collection and enforcement of delinquent local improvement assessments or installments shall be evidenced by a resolution, and the city council may authorize the collection and enforcement of such delinquent assessments or installments in any method provided for by this chapter. (1958 code § 6.24.120)


13.12.150 Failure to pay installment matures entire assessment.

When the assessment upon property is payable in installments, the failure to pay any installment due shall have the effect of maturing the entire assessment, and upon such failure to pay any installment when due, the entire assessment shall become due and payable, and the collection thereof enforced in the manner prescribed in this chapter and the resolution of the city council. (1958 code § 6.24.130)


13.12.160 Purchaser’s lien provisions.

The purchaser at any sale authorized in this chapter acquires a lien on the property so bid in by him for the amount paid by him at such sale, as well as for all taxes and delinquent assessments or delinquent installments thereof, and certificates of delinquency, and all interest, penalties, costs and charges thereon, whether levied previously or subsequently to such sale, and whether for state, county, city or town purposes, subsequently paid by him on such property, and shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 15 percent per year on the original amount paid by him from the date of such sale, and upon such subsequent payments from the date of the payment of the respective amounts.

b. Rate per each additional 1,000 gallons, $18.17.

2. Industries in which 15 percent or more of the total water volume is consumed in the industrial process and thus not discharged to the sanitary sewer may apply to the city council for an adjusted sewer discharge volume. The adjusted volume will be based on the volume of water discharged into the sewer. Documentation of flow volumes must be provided by the industry.

3. Industries with sanitary sewage effluent concentrations exceeding 300 mg/L BOD and/or 300 mg/L suspended solids must apply to the Washington State Department of Ecology for an industrial discharge permit. Based on the industry’s impact on the city’s sewage facilities, the Department of Ecology may issue a permit establishing conditions, and the city council shall establish charges, for the volume of discharge exceeding the 300 mg/L limit for BOD and/or suspended solids.

4. Industries discharging to permitted industrial wastewater pretreatment systems before discharging wastewater to the city sewer system will be charged based on the following formula, effective on the January 2019 billing:

	Charge	=	Q	x	$4.890 + 	[1.609 (BOD - 30) (8.34) + 1.666 (TSS) (8.34)]

	 	 	1,000	1,000

	Where	Q	=	Flow (Gallons)

	 	BOD	=	Biological oxygen demand (mg/L)

Users found to have reconnected storm drains shall be in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties contained herein.

B. Side Sewers. A side sewer is the sewer connecting an individual residence or structure to the city sewer. The maintenance of the side sewer is the responsibility of the property owner. Side sewers shall be watertight from under the structure to the city sewer to prevent the entrance of groundwater into the sanitary sewer system.

C. Side Sewer Replacement.

1. All users of the sanitary sewer system will be required to replace old side sewers constructed of concrete, terra cotta or other material with watertight plastic or ductile iron pipe.

2. The city superintendent will notify all property owners with side sewers that city records indicate have not been previously constructed with new watertight material that the side sewer must be replaced.

D. Replacement Schedule.

1. The city superintendent will notify property owners of the side sewer replacement requirement. The side sewer must be replaced within the time limit stated in the notification. In no case will the property owner be given less than 60 days to replace the sewer.

2. Low-income residents may request a time extension for replacement. The time extension will be limited to two years.

E. Charge for Defective Side Sewers. If a property owner fails to replace a side sewer within the time allotted in the notification, a charge of $20.00 per month will be added to the sewer utility billing until such time that the side sewer replacement has been properly completed.

F. Hardship Cases. In situations in which the property owner feels that the side sewer replacement would cause an unreasonable hardship due to permanent structures over the sewer or income limitations, the city council may grant a time extension for replacement or establish a fee based on the estimated groundwater entering the city’s sanitary sewer system.

15.12.040 Additional definitions – WAC 173-806-030. 

In addition to those definitions contained within WAC 197-11-700 through 197-11-799, when used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings, unless the context indicates otherwise:

A. “Department” means any division, subdivision or organizational unit of the city established by ordinance, rule or order.

B. “Early notice” means the city’s response to an applicant stating whether it considers issuance of a determination of significance likely for the applicant’s proposal (mitigated determination of nonsignificance (DNS) procedures).

15.12.050 Designation of responsible official – WAC 173-806-040.

A. For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the director of public works.

B. For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the lead agency or responsible official by those sections of the SEPA Rules that were adopted by reference in WAC 173-806-020.

C. The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA Rules (Chapter 197-11 WAC) and make them available in accordance with Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 2(C), 1984. Formerly 17.04.050.)


15.12.060 Lead agency determination – WAC 173-806-050.

A. The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

B. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.

C. When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

D. If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period.

E. Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

F. Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal (That is: Which agencies require nonexempt licenses?). (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 2(D), 1984. Formerly 17.04.060.)


15.12.070 Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency – WAC 173-806-053.

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the city’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 2(E), 1984. Formerly 17.04.070.)

1. The city should complete threshold determinations that can be based solely upon review of the environmental checklist for the proposal within 15 days of the date an applicant’s adequate application and completed checklist are submitted.

2. When the responsible official requires further information from the applicant or consultation with other agencies with jurisdiction:

a. The city should request such further information within 15 days of receiving an adequate application and completed environmental checklist;

b. The city shall wait no longer than 30 days for a consulted agency to respond;

c. The responsible official should complete the threshold determination within 15 days of receiving the requested information from the applicant or the consulted agency.

3. When the city must initiate further studies, including field investigations, to obtain the information to make the threshold determination, the city should complete the studies within 30 days of receiving an adequate application and a completed checklist.

4. The city shall complete threshold determinations on actions where the applicant recommends in writing that an EIS be prepared, because of the probable significant adverse environmental impact(s) described in the application, within 15 days of receiving an adequate application and completed checklist. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 2(F), 1984. Formerly 17.04.080.)


15.12.090 Additional timing considerations – WAC 173-806-058.

A. For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or draft EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission.

(Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 2(G), 1984. Formerly 17.04.090.)

Article IV. Categorical Exemptions and Threshold Determinations


15.12.100 Purpose of this article and adoption by reference – WAC 173-806-065.

This article contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a “probable significant, adverse environmental impact” requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This article also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference, as supplemented in this article:

WAC

197-11-300    Purpose of this part.

197-11-305    Categorical exemptions.

197-11-310    Threshold determination required.

197-11-315    Environmental checklist.

197-11-330    Threshold determination process.

(Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 3(A), 1984. Formerly 17.04.100.)


15.12.110 Flexible thresholds for categorical exemptions – WAC 173-806-070.

The city establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under WAC 197-11-800(1)(b) based on local conditions:

A. For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i): Up to 20 dwelling units;

B. For agricultural structures in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(ii): Up to 30,000 square feet;

C. For office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage buildings in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii): Up to 12,000 square feet and up to 40 parking spaces;

D. For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iv): Up to 40 parking spaces;

E. For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v): Up to 500 cubic yards. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 3(B), 1984. Formerly 17.04.110.)


15.12.120 Use of exemptions – WAC 173-806-080.

A. Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal, shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

B. In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt action, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

C. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

1. The city shall not give authorization for:

a. Any nonexempt action,

b. Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact, or

c. Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives;

2. A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

3. A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 3(C), 1984. Formerly 17.04.120.)


15.12.130 Environmental checklist – WAC 173-806-090.

A completed environmental checklist, in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 3(D), 1984. Formerly 17.04.130.)


15.12.140 Mitigated DNS – WAC 173-806-100.

A. As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

1. Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

2. Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C. The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within seven working days. The response shall:

1. Be written;

2. State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and

3. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D. As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

E. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

1. If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

2. If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent stormwater runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct a 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location” are adequate.

4. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

F. The mitigated DNS issued under WAC 197-11-340(2) requires a 15-day comment period and public notice.

G. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.

H. If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).

I. The city’s written response under subsection (B) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 3(E), 1984. Formerly 17.04.140.)

B. The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be prepared by city staff, the applicant, or by a consultant selected by the city or the applicant. If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that someone other than the city will prepare the EIS, the responsible official shall notify the applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also notify the applicant of the city’s procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution.

C. The city may require an applicant to provide information the city does not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is not required to supply information that is not required under this chapter or that is being requested from another agency. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412, Part 4(B), 1984.

The time periods provided by this chapter for making a threshold determination shall not begin to run until payment of the fee.

B. Environmental Impact Statement.

1. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal requiring an EIS and the responsible official determines that the EIS shall be prepared by employees of the city, the city may charge and collect a reasonable fee from any applicant to cover costs incurred by the city in preparing the EIS. The responsible official shall advise the applicant(s) of the projected costs for the EIS prior to actual preparation; the applicant shall post bond or otherwise ensure payment of such costs.

2. The responsible official may determine that the city will contract directly with a consultant for preparation of an EIS, or a portion of the EIS, for activities initiated by some persons or entity other than the city and may bill such costs and expenses directly to the applicant. The city may require the applicant to post bond or otherwise ensure payment of such costs. Such consultants shall be selected by mutual agreement of the city and applicant after a call for proposals.

3. If a proposal is modified so that an EIS is no longer required, the responsible official shall refund any fees collected under subsection (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section which remain after incurred costs are paid.

C. The city may collect a reasonable fee from an applicant to cover the cost of meeting the public notice requirements of this chapter relating to the applicant’s proposal.

D. The city may charge any person for copies of any document prepared under this chapter, and for mailing the document, in a manner provided by Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 1845 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1412 Part 10(B), 1984. Formerly 17.04.260.)

The findings and policies of the Pacific County resource lands and critical areas and the following mitigation policies are to be exercised on developments such that land use activities shall be located and designed to minimize conflict. 

A. Forest Resource Lands.

1. Notification shall be placed on all subdivision proposals that the adjacent land is in forest resource use and subject to a variety of activities that may not be compatible with residential development. 

B. Agricultural Resource Lands.

1. The obligation for buffer strips is to farms that choose to subdivide or transition to a noncompatible use.

2. Existing farm uses are to be protected from adjacent noncompatible development uses.

3. When land containing prime and unique agricultural land is converted, the prime and unique agricultural land uses shall be maintained while allowing for other uses on suitable land.

4. Prime and unique agricultural lands are to be retained within existing and future city boundaries.

5. Agricultural land may be annexed as transitional land into the city limits for urban preferred land uses.

6. Cranberry production is a higher priority use when multiple resource land and critical area designations overlap.

7. Nonagricultural development shall provide buffers and mitigation between development and cranberry production areas. These buffers or transition areas may include increased setbacks to shield spray drift, noise, visual impact, and other aspects of active agricultural operations.

8. Aquacultural activities introduced to Willapa Bay shall be compatible with and not disruptive to the natural, biological, and physical dynamic force within the estuary.

9. Upland development shall not impede the natural condition of the estuary. 

C. Mineral Resource Lands.

1. Settling ponds shall be used on new rock pit developments to protect water quality and prevent sedimentation.

2. Mining sites shall be located where adjacent land is used for mining, open space, forestry or industrial use and where they can be screened from residential and commercial properties to minimize the extractive operational impacts of blasting, noise, dust, heavy equipment, mines, pits and vibration. Screening and buffering is the responsibility of the new or expanded mineral extraction development.

3. Sand removal operations shall be separated from tourist and recreational activities.

D. Critical Areas – Wetlands.

1. Development in wetlands shall provide shoreline access through easements, trust accounts for school field trips on the value and function of wetlands, or the proposed enhancement of specific wetland functions associated with the development.

2. Wetland mitigation shall be based on wetland function and value in addition to overall area of disturbance.

E. Aquifer Recharge Areas.

1. Nonforestry activities and other developments in critical recharge areas must demonstrate to the water purveyor and local governments all potential environmental impacts to the recharge area as a result of the proposed development.

2. On proposed developments, the effects and impacts of stormwater runoff from urban areas should be carefully analyzed and cities and counties should consider retention of all stormwater on-site as an aquifer recharge protection measure.

F. Geologically Hazardous Areas.

1. On new construction, road construction practices shall be modified to avoid erosion, landslide and slumping.

G. Frequently Flooded Areas.

1. Forest and associated watersheds within a development shall be managed through forest practices or best management practices to reduce flood damage and associated impacts to frequently flooded areas.

2. Development proposals shall address coastal high hazards and the impact of coastal flooding to loss of life and property.

H. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Areas.

1. Construction activities shall mitigate impact to wildlife displacement and habitat reduction through open space, wetland and habitat retention areas.

2. Education shall be considered as a mitigation measure to enhance and conserve wildlife habitat.

3. Proposed development shall consider as a mitigation measure the compatibility and use of fish and wildlife habitat within buffer areas.

4. Proposed fish and wildlife habitat areas shall consider the total habitat value provided rather than habitat needed for a single species. (Ord. 1638 § 3, 2001; Ord. 1524, 1992. Formerly 17.04.320.)

15.16.010 Statutory authorization.

The legislature of the state has in Chapter 36.70 RCW delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city does ordain as set out in this chapter. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are impacted by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flooding losses. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; reduce the annual cost of flood insurance; and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A. To protect human life and health;

B. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.040 Methods of reducing flood losses. 

In order to accomplish its purpose, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards; or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.050 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, terms or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application:

A. “Appeal” means a request for a review of the local administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

B. “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow; and AH indicates ponding.

C. “Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters “A” or “V.”

D. “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” Designated on the FIRM by the letters “A” or “V.”

E. “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade below ground level on all sides.

F. “Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 

G. “Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include (but are not limited to) schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

H. “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

I. “Elevated building” means for insurance purposes, a non-basement building that has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.

J. “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface water from any source.

L. “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

M. “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

N. “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter found at RMC 15.16.170(A)(2) (i.e., provided there are adequate flood ventilation openings).

O. “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

P. “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

Q. “New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

S. “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a concrete slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

T. “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

U. “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

V. Substantial Improvement.

1. “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

a. Before the improvement or repair is started; or

b. If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

2. The term does not, however, include either:

a. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

b. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or State Inventory of Historic Places.

W. “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 

X. “Water dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry that cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.070 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “Flood Insurance Study, Pacific County, Washington, and Incorporated Areas, dated May 18, 2015,” with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the FIRM are on file at City Hall, 230 Second Street, Raymond, Washington. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in RMC 15.16.140(B) shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under RMC 15.16.140(B). The base flood elevation is established at 10 feet NAVD 1988, per the FIRM dated May 18, 2015. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.080 Penalties for noncompliance.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction hereof be fined not more than $300.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.090 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.100 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.110 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer, or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.120 Establishment of development permit.

A. Development or Building Permit Required. A development or building permit shall be obtained before development or construction begins within any area of special flood hazard established in RMC 15.16.070. The building permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes, as set forth in RMC 15.16.050, and the development permit for all other development, including fill and other activities, also as set forth in RMC 15.16.050.

B. Application for Permits. Application for a building permit shall be in accordance with RMC 15.84.030. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city. Applications shall include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, locations, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

1. Elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures recorded on a current elevation certificate (FF 81-31) with Section B completed by an authorized official;

2. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed;

3. Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in RMC 15.16.170(B);

4. Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.130 Designation of the local administrator.

The director of public works is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.140 Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator.

Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

A. Permit Review.

1. Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;

2. Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local government agencies from which prior approval is required;

3. Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of RMC 15.16.180(A) are met.

B. Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided (in A or V zones) in accordance with RMC 15.16.070, the local administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from the federal, state, or other source, in order to administer RMC 15.16.170 and 15.16.180.

C. Information to Be Obtained and Maintained.

1. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or required as in subsection (B) of this section, obtain and record the actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. Record elevations on a current elevation certificate (FF 81-31) with Section B completed by an authorized official.

2. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required in subsection (B) of this section:

a. Obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and

b. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in RMC 15.16.120(B)(3).

3. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

D. Alteration of Watercourses.

1. Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration; and

2. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

E. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations, where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (e.g., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in RMC 15.16.200. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.150 Conditions for variances.

A. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

E. Variances, as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program, are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, or the economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

F. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (A) of this section, and otherwise complies with RMC 15.16.160(A), (C), and (E).

G. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

H. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.160 General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:

A. Anchoring.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.

2. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. For more detailed information, refer to FEMA-85 guidebook titled “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas.”

B. Construction Materials and Methods.

1. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

3. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 

C. Utilities.

1. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.

 2. Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway, see WAC 173-160-171 for additional guidelines.

3. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters.

4. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

D. Storage of Certain Materials. The storage of materials within special flood hazard areas that in the time of flooding are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be deleterious to the environment are prohibited.

E. Subdivision Proposals.

1. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

2. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;

3. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and

4. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).

F. Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the FIS, FIRM, or from another authoritative source (RMC 15.16.140(B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.170 Specific standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in RMC 15.16.070 or 15.16.140(B), the following provisions are required:

A. Residential Construction.

1. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to 14.5 feet NAVD, 1988 Datum or higher, in order to be concurrent with the previous NGVD 1929 Datum. Adding this additional foot of freeboard increases safety and can reduce insurance premiums by as much as 30 percent. Adding additional freeboard is encouraged.

2. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the finished ground grade;

c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that the openings permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Note: Foundation vent standards required by the IBC/IRC outside the floodplain do not meet this standard and are often inadvertently permitted which may increase flood insurance premiums. 

B. Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to 14.5 feet NAVD, 1988 Datum or higher, in order to be concurrent with the previous NGVD 1929 Datum, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities shall:

1. Be floodproofed so that below one foot or more above the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. Adding an additional foot of freeboard increases safety and can reduce insurance premiums by as much as 30 percent. Adding additional freeboard is encouraged.

2. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.

3. Be stamped by a registered professional engineer or certified by an architect to ensure that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this section based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications, and plans. Project certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in RMC 15.16.140(C)(2).

4. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (A)(2) of this section.

5. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to one foot above the base flood level will be rated as at the base flood level).

C. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within “A” and “V” zones on the community’s FIRM shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at 14.5 feet NAVD, 1988 Datum or higher, in order to be concurrent with the previous NGVD 1929 Datum, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of RMC 15.16.160(A). 

D. Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

3. Meet the requirements of subsection (C) of this section. 

 E. Critical Facilities. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of areas of special flood hazard (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the areas of special flood hazard if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the areas of special flood hazard shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet above base flood elevation or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.180 Floodways. 

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in RMC 15.16.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway can be an extremely hazardous area as a result of the velocity of floodwaters which may carry debris, and can increase erosion potential on unprotected shorelines and roadways, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibition of encroachments, including compacted and uncompacted fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

1. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

2. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure either:

a. Before the repair or reconstruction is started; or 

b. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes, or to structures identified as historic places, may be excluded from the 50 percent fair market value limitation.

C. If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of RMC 15.16.160 and 15.16.170. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.190 Chapter provisions not exclusive. 

Nothing contained in this chapter shall infringe upon or derogate against the provisions of the fire zone ordinance and the building code of the city. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)


15.16.200 Appeals. 

A. The planning commission, established by the city council, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B. The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C. In passing upon such applications, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

11. The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.

D. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (C) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

E. The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 1835 § 1, 2015)

(Ord. 1863 § 5, 2017)


15.18.060 Definitions.

This section incorporates all definitions provided under RMC Titles 15, 16, and 17.

A. “Administrator” means the director of public works or designee.

B. “Critical areas” includes the following areas and ecosystems as defined in RCW 36.70A.030 and WAC 365-195-200:

1. Wetlands;

2. Areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable waters;

3. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas;

4. Frequently flooded areas; and

5. Geologically hazardous areas.

C. “Fish and wildlife habitat conservation area” means land managed for maintaining species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic distribution so that isolated subpopulations are not created. This does not mean maintaining all individuals of all species always, but it does mean cooperative and coordinated land use planning is critically important among counties and cities in a region. In some cases, intergovernmental cooperation and coordination may show that it is sufficient to assure that a species will usually be found in certain regions across the state. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas include areas with which endangered, threatened, and sensitive species have a primary association; waters of the state; state natural area preserves and natural conservation areas; and streams and rivers planted with game fish by a governmental agency. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas do not include such artificial features or constructs as irrigation delivery systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or drainage ditches that lie within the boundaries of and are maintained by a port district or an irrigation district or company.

D. “Geologically hazardous areas” means areas that, because of the susceptibility to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events, are not generally suited to locating commercial, residential, or industrial development consistent with public health or safety concerns. Geologically hazardous areas are characterized by slopes greater than 15 percent and known erosion, landslides, settling, rockslide, debris flow and/or seismic hazards as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service.

E. Species of Concern. Species of concern in Washington include those species listed as state endangered, state threatened, state sensitive, or state candidate, as well as species listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service. See WAC 232-12-297 for further definition.

F. Type S Water. “Type S water” means all waters, within their bankfull width, as inventoried as “shorelines of the state” under Chapter 90.58 RCW and the rules promulgated pursuant to Chapter 90.58 RCW including periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands.

G. Type F Water. “Type F water” means segments of natural waters other than Type S waters, which are within the bankfull widths of defined channels and periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands, or within lakes, ponds, or impoundments having a surface area of one-half acre or greater at seasonal low water and which in any case contain fish habitat or are described by one of the following four categories:

1. Waters, which are diverted for domestic use by more than 10 residential or camping units or by a public accommodation facility licensed to serve more than 10 persons, where such diversion is determined by the department to be a valid appropriation of water and the only practical water source for such users. Such waters shall be considered as Type F water upstream from the point of such diversion for 1,500 feet or until the drainage area is reduced by 50 percent, whichever is less;

2. Waters, which are diverted for use by federal, state, tribal or private fish hatcheries. Such waters shall be considered Type F water upstream from the point of diversion for 1,500 feet, including tributaries if highly significant for protection of downstream water quality. The department may allow additional harvest beyond the requirements of Type F water designation provided the department determines after a landowner-requested on-site assessment by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Ecology, the affected tribes and interested parties that:

a. The management practices proposed by the landowner will adequately protect water quality for the fish hatchery; and

b. Such additional harvest meets the requirements of the water type designation that would apply in the absence of the hatchery;

3. Waters, which are within a federal, state, local, or private campground having more than 10 camping units; provided, that the water shall not be considered to enter a campground until it reaches the boundary of the park lands available for public use and comes within 100 feet of a camping unit, trail, or other park improvement;

4. Riverine ponds, wall-based channels, and other channel features that are used by fish for off-channel habitat. These areas are critical to the maintenance of optimum survival of fish. This habitat shall be identified based on the following criteria:

a. The site must be connected to a fish habitat stream and accessible during some period of the year; and

b. The off-channel water must be accessible to fish.

H. Type Np Water. “Type Np water” means all segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of defined channels that are perennial non-fish habitat streams. Perennial streams are flowing waters that do not go dry any time of a year of normal rainfall and include the intermittent dry portions of the perennial channel below the uppermost point of perennial flow.

I. Type Ns Water. “Type Ns water” means all segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of the defined channels that are not Type S, F, or Np waters. These are seasonal, non-fish habitat streams in which surface flow is not present for at least some portion of a year of normal rainfall and are not located downstream from any stream reach that is a Type Np water. Ns waters must be physically connected by an above-ground channel system to Type S, F, or Np waters.

J. “Waters of the state” includes lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, estuaries, tidal flats, beaches and lands adjoining the seacoast of the state, sewers, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington.

K. “Wetland or wetlands” means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created because of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

L. Qualified Professional. A qualified professional for wetlands must be a professional wetland scientist with at least two years of full-time work experience as a wetlands professional, including delineating wetlands using the federal manual and supplements, preparing wetlands reports, conducting function assessments, and developing and implementing mitigation plans. (Ord. 1863 § 6, 2017)


15.18.070 Compliance with critical areas protection.

All public and private land uses in the city of Raymond shall comply with the requirements of this chapter as a condition to any project permit application granted under Chapter 15.08 RMC. (Ord. 1863 § 7, 2017)


15.18.080 Exempt activities in critical areas.

A. The following uses or activities within a critical area or critical area buffer are exempt from the requirements of this chapter to the extent that they are not prohibited by other state or federal laws and do not degrade the critical area:

1. Conservation, enhancement, restoration, or preservation measures or projects;

2. Low intensity, passive recreational uses;

3. Short-term scientific studies and educational uses;

4. Maintenance, operation, and/or repair of existing rights-of-way, trails, roads, bridges, buildings, utilities, and other facilities;

5. Maintenance of existing, lawfully established landscaping and gardens, including but not limited to mowing lawns, weeding, removal of noxious and invasive species, harvesting and replanting of garden crops, and pruning and planting of ornamental vegetation or indigenous native species;

6. Maintenance, repair, or replacement of an existing nonconforming structure that does not further alter or increase the impact to the critical area or buffer and results in no increased risk to life or property;

7. Replacement, modification, installation, or construction of utility facilities, lines, pipes, mains, equipment, or appurtenances, not including substations, when such facilities are located within the existing public rights-of-way or private roadway;

8. The removal of hazard trees that are posing a threat to public safety or an imminent risk of damage to a permanent structure;

9. Navigation aids and boundary markers;

10. Existing and ongoing agricultural activities, if they implement applicable best management practices (BMPs) contained in the latest editions of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service Field Office Technical Guide; or develop a farm conservation plan in coordination with the local conservation district. BMPs and/or farm plans should address potential impacts to wetlands from livestock, nutrient and farm chemicals, soil erosion and sediment control, and agricultural drainage infrastructure. BMPs and/or farm plans should ensure that ongoing agricultural activities minimize their effects on water quality, riparian ecology, salmonid populations, and wildlife habitat;

11. Site investigation work necessary for land use applications; and

12. Class 1 through 3 forest practices governed by Chapter 76.09 RCW. (Ord. 1863 § 8, 2017)


15.18.090 Overlapping critical areas.

A critical area may overlap with other identified critical areas. Likely areas of overlap include geologically hazardous areas, wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. When a critical area overlaps with one or more critical areas, all the performance standards established for the overlaying critical area(s) shall apply. If multiple critical areas overlap in an area, the most restrictive conditions shall apply. (Ord. 1863 § 9, 2017)


15.18.100 Emergency work in critical areas.

The administrator may authorize emergency work in critical areas without a permit if that official determines an imminent threat to public health or safety will occur before completion of normal permit procedures.

e. Measures to protect and maintain plants until established.

These written specifications shall be accompanied by detailed site diagrams, scaled cross-sectional drawings, and topographic maps showing slope percentage and final grade elevations, and any other drawings appropriate to show construction techniques or anticipated outcome.

4. Monitoring Program. The mitigation plan shall include a program for monitoring construction of the compensation project and for assessing a completed project. A protocol shall be included outlining the schedule for site monitoring (for example, monitoring shall occur in years 1, 3, 5, and 7 after site construction), and how the monitoring data will be evaluated to determine if the performance standards are being met. A monitoring report shall be submitted as needed to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project. The compensation project shall be monitored for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period less than five years.

5. Contingency Plan. The mitigation plan shall include identification of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates project performance standards are not being met. (Ord. 1863 § 15, 2017)


15.18.160 Sureties for mitigation improvements.

A. The city may require the applicant to submit a surety for the construction, maintenance, and/or monitoring of any mitigation measures required under this chapter for a period not to exceed the established monitoring period. The city may release the surety earlier than assigned if a technical assessment prepared by a qualified professional affirms that the mitigation measure is functioning in accordance with its design.

B. The amount of a construction surety shall be not less than 125 percent of the contract cost for the mitigation improvement as estimated by the administrator. The amount of a maintenance surety shall be not less than 15 percent of the total cost of the mitigation improvement as estimated by the administrator.

2. No feasible and reasonable on-site alternative to the proposed activities is possible, including possible changes in site layout, reductions in density, and similar factors that would allow a reasonable economic use with fewer adverse impacts;

3. The proposed activities, as conditioned, will result in the minimum possible impacts to affected critical areas, considering their functions and/or the risks associated with proposed development;

4. The inability to derive reasonable economic use is not the result of the applicant’s actions or that of a previous property owner, such as by segregating or dividing the property and creating an undevelopable condition; and

5. Any alteration of a critical area approved under this section shall be subject to appropriate conditions and will require mitigation under an approved mitigation plan.

D. Approval of a reasonable use exception shall not eliminate the need for any other permit or approval otherwise required for a proposal by applicable city regulations. (Ord. 1863 § 19, 2017)


15.18.200 Variances.

Any wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall also include the standard buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.

B. The total point score from the wetland rating form shall determine the width of required buffers. Buffer widths are measured perpendicularly from the wetland boundary as determined through a field survey. Buffer widths shall not include those areas functionally and effectively disconnected from the wetland, such as by a road or other structures. When a buffer lacks adequate vegetation, the city may increase the standard buffer, require buffer planting or enhancement, and/or deny a proposal for buffer reduction or buffer averaging.

C. The city adopts the following dimensions for required wetland buffers shown in Table 1:

Table 1: Required Wetland Buffer Widths 

	Wetland category	Standard buffer width	Additional buffer width if wetland scores 5 habitat points	Additional buffer width if wetland scores 6 – 7 habitat points	Additional buffer width if wetland scores 8 – 9 habitat points

	Category 1: Based on total score	75 feet	Add 30 feet	Add 90 feet	Add 150 feet

	Category 1: Natural heritage wetland	190 feet	NA	NA	Add 35 feet

	Category 1: Forested wetland	75 feet	Add 30 feet	Add 90 feet	Add 150 feet

	Category 1: Estuarine wetland	150 feet	NA	NA	NA

	Category 2: Based on total score	75 feet	Add 30 feet	Add 90 feet	Add 150 feet

	Category 2: Estuarine wetland	110 feet	NA	NA	NA

	Category 3: (All)	60 feet	Add 45 feet	Add 105 feet	NA

	Category 4: (All)	40 feet	NA	NA	NA

D. Development adjacent to wetland buffers shall implement the following where applicable:

1. Route stormwater runoff away from buffer and wetland if storm drainage conveyance system is available;

2. Use low impact development techniques to reduce water quality impacts if storm drainage conveyance system is not available;

3. Encourage adjacent landowner(s) to use best management actions relating to fertilizers and pesticides;

4. Direct lights away from wetlands;

5. Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland. If warranted, enhance the existing buffer with native vegetation plantings adjacent to noise source. For activities that generate relatively continuous, potentially disruptive noise, such as certain heavy industry or mining, establish an additional 10-foot heavily vegetated buffer strip immediately adjacent to the outer wetland buffer; and

6. Use privacy fencing or plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge, and to discourage disturbance, using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion.

E. The following wetlands may be exempt from the requirement to avoid impacts, and they may be filled if the impacts are fully mitigated based on the remaining actions in RMC 15.18.240. If available, impacts should be mitigated through the purchase of credits from an in-lieu fee program or mitigation bank, consistent with the terms and conditions of the program or bank. To verify the following conditions, a critical area report for wetlands meeting the requirement in RMC 15.18.250 must be submitted:

1. All isolated Category IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet that:

a. Are not associated with riparian areas or their buffers;

b. Are not associated with shorelines of the state or their associated buffers;

c. Are not part of a wetland mosaic;

d. Do not score five or more points for habitat function based on the 2014 update to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology); or

e. Do not contain a priority habitat or a Priority Area 1 for a priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat, or species of local importance, identified in RMC 15.18.290.

2. Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet that meet the above criteria and do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions contained in this section.

F. Required wetland buffer widths do not extend over the upland side of an existing road, rail grade, or street that divides a wetland buffer area. (Ord. 1863 § 22, 2017)


15.18.230 Wetland buffering average.

A. The administrator may allow the averaging of buffer widths in accordance with a wetland technical report if this will improve the protection of wetland functions, or if it is the only way to allow for reasonable use of a parcel. Buffer averaging may occur in the following situations:

1. Averaging to improve wetland protection when all the following conditions are present:

a. The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a “dual-rated” wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower rated area;

b. The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher-functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower functioning or less sensitive portion; the total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

c. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-quarters of the required width.

2. Averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel when all the following conditions are present:

a. There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging;

b. The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions as demonstrated by a report from a qualified wetland professional;

c. The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

d. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-quarters of the required width.

e. Averaging below three-quarters of the required width shall require a variance. (Ord. 1863 § 23, 2017)


15.18.240 Wetland mitigation.

A. If an application for development activities makes it necessary to alter or eliminate a wetland, the applicant shall compensate the loss or alteration by one or more of the following actions:

1. Restoring wetland acreage and functions to an area where it formerly occurred;

2. Creating a new wetland area with functions in an area where they did not previously occur;

3. Enhancing the functions at an existing wetland; and/or

4. Preserving the functions of an existing high-quality wetland to protect it from future loss or degradation.

5. Mitigation is allowed if there is no net loss of ecological function.

B. Altered wetlands shall require mitigation to ensure the same level of wetland function that existed at the time of the permit application. Table 2 below sets mitigation ratios for the type of action taken.

 

Table 2: Wetland Mitigation Ratios 

	 	Category 1	Category 1 Forested	Category 1 Estuary	Category 2	Category 2 Estuary	Category 3	Category 4

1. Designating Geologically Hazardous Areas.

a. Soil Survey of Grays Harbor County Area, Pacific County, and Wahkiakum County Washington, USDA, 1986;

b. Washington Department of Natural Resources Geologic Information Portal interactive maps.

2. If the location, designation, or classification of a geologically hazardous area shown on any map adopted by reference under the RMC conflicts with the determination of any field investigation, the latter shall prevail.

C. Designated geologically hazardous areas are areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible commercial, residential, or industrial development occurs in areas of significant hazard. Geologically hazardous areas with significant hazard include:

1. Areas that are susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be classified as a geologically hazardous area:

a. Erosion hazard;

b. Landslide hazard;

c. Seismic hazard; or

d. Areas subject to other geological events such as coal mine hazards and volcanic hazards including: mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement.

2. Erosion hazard areas identified by the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service as having a “severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard.

3. Landslide hazard areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include any areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Example of these may include, but are not limited to the following:

a. Areas of historic failures, such as:

i. Those areas delineated by the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service as having a “severe” limitation for building site development;

ii. Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published as the United States Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources Division of Geology and Earth Resources;

b. Areas with all three of the following characteristics;

i. Slopes steeper than 15 percent;

ii. Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and

iii. Springs or ground water seepage;

c. Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene Epoch (from 10,000 years ago to the present) or which are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch;

d. Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials;

e. Slopes having gradients steeper than 80 percent subject to rock fall during seismic shaking;

f. Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action;

g. Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding; or

h. Any area with a slope of 40 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least 10 feet of vertical relief.

4. Seismic hazard areas subject to severe risk of damage because of earthquake-induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, or surface faulting. One indicator of potential for future earthquake damage is a record of earthquake damage in the past. Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage in Washington. The strength of ground shaking is primarily affected by:

a. The magnitude of an earthquake;

b. The distance from the source of an earthquake;

c. The type of thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and

d. The type of subsurface geologic structure.

5. Settlement and soil liquefaction conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless soils of low density, typically in association with a shallow ground water table. (Ord. 1863 § 26, 2017)


15.18.270 Geologically hazardous areas technical reports.

A. The city may require a technical assessment prepared by a qualified professional for any non-exempt development activities proposed in a geologically hazardous area. The report shall:

1. Determine the exact boundaries of all geologically hazardous areas affecting the site and the impact of the proposed development;

2. Assess the geologic characteristics of the soils, sediments, and/or rock on the project site and on potentially affected neighboring properties;

3. Analyze the hazards in relation to the project and potentially affected adjacent properties;

4. Include plans for the proposed development that show:

a. The location of existing and proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, and drainage facilities, with dimensions indicating distances to adjacent properties and its structures;

b. Areas that will be cleared and retained in natural vegetation; and

5. Recommend mitigation measures or appropriate buffers to protect the public’s health, safety, and welfare from the hazard(s). (Ord. 1863 § 27, 2017)


15.18.280 Mitigation in geologically hazardous areas.

Engineering, design, or modified construction or mining practices can reduce or mitigate some geological hazards so that risks to health and safety are acceptable. However, when a project cannot reduce risks to acceptable levels, building in geologically hazardous areas is prohibited. (Ord. 1863 § 28, 2017)


15.18.290 Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas designation.

A. The city shall regulate development activities to protect fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. These areas in the city include:

15.18.300 Development standards for fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas.

A. Development activities occurring on lands and waters containing documented habitats for plant and animal species in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall result in no net loss of existing function.

B. Development activities allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be consistent with the species located there and shall be regulated additionally by restrictions defined in applicable federal, state, and local regulations regarding the species.

C. Because of the limited presence of intact riparian vegetation along many shorelines within the city, shoreline development should ensure no net loss of these areas to the greatest extent possible. Depending on the width and quality of the riparian cover, development should retain riparian vegetation as a buffer to ensure no net loss of water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, estuarine wetlands, and/or bank protection. (Ord. 1863 § 30, 2017)


15.18.310 Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas buffers required.

A. Buffers are necessary to protect the integrity and function of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. Buffer widths shall reflect a balance between the sensitivity of the species or habitat and the intensity of the adjacent human use or activity.

B. The required width of upland buffers to protect fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas along shorelines of the state in the city may vary depending on ecological conditions of the shoreline and the extent of existing development.

C. The following riparian buffer widths shall apply along waters of the state above the ordinary high water mark:

1. Type S waters: buffers are set forth in SMP Table 2: Minimum Shoreline Buffer by Shoreline Designation.

2. Type F waters greater than 20 feet wide: 100 feet.

3. Type F waters greater than two feet and up to 20 feet in width: 40 feet.

4. Type Np waters: 30 feet.

5. Type Ns Waters: 20 feet.

D. Development along waters of the state should retain existing vegetation landward of the ordinary high water mark to the greatest extent feasible. However, in those areas of the city where riparian vegetation is limited by past land use practices or existing development, the administrator may approve a reduction in the required buffer widths if the reduction does not result in a net loss of ecological function. The administrator may alter or reduce the required buffer width under the following conditions:

1. A buffer may be reduced to the waterward edge of an improved public right-of-way, rail grade, or flood control structure that physically separates a buffer into one or more sections and disconnects hydraulic continuity to a shoreline.

2. A buffer may be averaged consistent with RMC 15.18.320, Habitat buffer averaging.

3. In those areas of the city where existing upland development or in-water structures prevent the establishment or maintenance of a required buffer, the administrator may:

a. Reduce or altogether exempt the required upland buffer;

b. Require in-water mitigation beneficial to salmonids and other wildlife, such as placement of large wood or removal of derelict structures; and/or

c. Require on-site low impact development improvements to retain and treat stormwater surface run-off.

E. The required buffer for upland endangered, threatened, and sensitive species shall be in accordance with a habitat management technical report prepared by a qualified professional. Approval for alteration of land adjacent to the habitat conservation area or its buffer shall not occur before consultation with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

F. Any requirements for buffers, buffer enhancement, or low impact development improvements shall be in place concurrent with occupancy of the development. (Ord. 1863 § 31, 2017)


15.18.320 Habitat buffer averaging.

A. The administrator may allow the recommended habitat area buffer width to be reduced in accordance with a habitat management technical report, the best available science, and the management recommendations issued by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, only if:

1. It will not reduce stream or habitat functions;

2. It will not adversely affect salmonid habitat;

3. It will provide additional natural resource protection, such as buffer enhancement;

4. The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and

5. The buffer area width is not reduced by more than 25 percent. (Ord. 1863 § 32, 2017)


15.18.330 Habitat management technical reports.

A. The city may require a habitat management plan prepared by a qualified professional for any non-exempt development activity proposed in or adjacent to a habitat conservation area.

B. Habitat management plans shall reflect the guidelines set forth in the Management Recommendations for Washington’s Priority Species, Volumes I through V.

C. The format of habitat management plans shall include:

1. A detailed description of vegetation on and adjacent to the project area and its associated buffer;

2. The identification of any species of local importance, priority species, or endangered, threatened, sensitive, or candidate species that have a primary association with habitat on or adjacent to the project area, and assessment of potential project impacts to the use of the site by the species;

3. A discussion of any federal, state, or local special management recommendations, including Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife habitat management recommendations, that have been developed for species or habitats located on or adjacent to the project area;

4. A detailed discussion of the direct and indirect potential impacts on habitat by the project, including potential impacts to water quality;

5. A discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization, and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing habitats and restore any habitat that was degraded before the current proposed land use activity; and

6. A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect habitat after a project’s completion, including a description for monitoring and maintenance programs. (Ord. 1863 § 33, 2017)

15.47.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide flexibility in siting planned unit developments (PUDs) within the Waterfront Commercial (WFC), General Commercial (GC), Light Manufacturing (M-1) and Heavy Manufacturing (M-2) districts in the city of Raymond. Planned unit developments are established to encourage comprehensive planning, innovative development and a mix of land uses for larger (two acres or more) land parcels. The PUD provides the opportunity for mixed use commercial (including light industrial, manufacturing, retail) and housing, enhanced public services and efficient use of infrastructure.

Planned unit developments allow creative land development through clustering, preservation of wetlands and other natural areas, integration of recreational facilities and phasing of developments.

Planned unit developments (PUDs) are intended to:

A. Permit diversity and variety in allowable uses, location, and types of structures;

B. Promote the efficient use of land by facilitating density through a flexible arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities;

C. Preserve, where possible, the existing landscape features and minimize adverse effects on sensitive environmental areas;

D. Allow the combination and coordination of architectural styles, building forms, and building relationships within the planned area. (Ord. 1700 § 1, 2005)


15.47.020 Definitions.

A planned unit development (PUD) is defined as a mixed use development designed as a single unit to facilitate creative development by providing flexibility in site layout, density, and uses in return for the provision of minimization of impacts to view corridors and preservation of historic and natural features and systems. (Ord. 1700 § 2, 2005)


15.47.030 PUD is an overlay zone.

A. The regulations governing PUDs constitute an overlay zone and superimpose the PUD regulations on the underlying zoning district. When regulations of the PUD and the underlying zoning district differ, the PUD regulations must be followed.

B. Any use normally subject to a conditional use permit will be permitted outright if that use is approved by the city council in a PUD.

C. PUDs may be permitted in the following zoning districts:

1. WFC Waterfront Commercial;

2. GC General Commercial;

3. M-1 Light Industrial;

4. M-2 Heavy Industrial;

D. PUD General Development Standards. A PUD may be approved if it is found that the development conforms to all of the following general criteria:

1. The location, design, and uses of the PUD shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan, shorelines management program, and with other applicable plans and ordinances adopted by the city.

2. The PUD shall be integrated with its surroundings. In the case of a departure in character from the surrounding land uses, the scale, intensity and design shall adequately reduce the impact of the development in such a way that the project will not be significantly detrimental to the neighborhood.

3. The traffic generated by the PUD shall be accommodated safely and within the established levels of service for affected streets.

4. All development will be adequately served by existing or planned facilities and services.

5. The PUD will result in an attractive, healthful, efficient and stable environment for living, shopping, working and leisure activities.

6. The PUD shall make adequate and appropriate provisions for the preservation of the environment, both natural and manmade, and the conservation of energy. (Ord. 1700 § 3, 2005)


15.47.040 Specific development standards.

All PUD projects shall comply with the following standards, which are intended to provide guidance and predictability to all participants in the PUD process:

A. Parcel Size. PUDs shall generally be two acres or larger. An area less than two acres in size may be considered for a PUD. PUDs on parcels smaller than two acres may be permitted; provided, that:

1. The site has natural or aesthetic features which may be destroyed or adversely affected by traditional development techniques otherwise allowed; or

2. Properties in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development are all or mostly developed, or are otherwise not available for acquisition nor suitable for the proposed use; and

3. The uses and style of the proposed development will be consistent with and/or complementary to the existing development character of the area.

B. Perimeter Setbacks.

1. A PUD smaller than two acres in area shall conform to the perimeter setback requirements of the adjoining zoning.

2. Buildings located on the perimeter of a PUD two acres or larger in area shall maintain minimum front, side, and rear setbacks according to the height of the perimeter buildings, as follows:

Perimeter Building Setbacks 

	Height	Front	Side	Rear

	0 – 25 ft.	20 ft.	10 ft.	10 ft.

	25 – 35 ft.	25 ft.	15 ft.	15 ft.

	Over 35 ft.	30 ft.	20 ft.	20 ft.

3. For parking lots, streets and other perimeter improvements (not including buildings) setbacks may be reduced to comply with the underlying zone setback criteria.

C. Height. Nonindustrial buildings within a PUD in excess of 45 feet shall meet the requirements of the fire code as reviewed and approved by the city fire chief. Industrial building heights shall comply with RMC requirements.

D. Circulation.

1. All access streets shall be dedicated, designed and constructed in accordance with the City’s adopted street standards.

2. Interior roadways that provide access to individual lots or to individual structures are considered driveways and are not subject to street development standards. The adequacy of their design will be reviewed and decided through the PUD process.

3. Adequate access for emergency vehicles shall be provided.

4. A pedestrian circulation system shall be designed to assure that pedestrians can move safely and conveniently both within the PUD and between the PUD and nearby properties and activities, as appropriate.

5. All streets and parking areas shall contribute to the overall aesthetic design of the PUD, while minimizing traffic congestion and the amount of impervious surface area.

6. No parking or maneuvering areas, other than access driveways, shall be allowed within the PUD’s perimeter setbacks when the development is within or abutting a residential zoning district.

7. Adequate parking and loading areas must be provided as needed to service the development.

E. Screening. All utility facilities, loading areas, trash containers, and outdoor storage areas shall be screened from surrounding properties. Solid fences, walls, and blank walls of buildings shall be softened through the use of trees and/or other landscaping materials if their impact cannot be minimized through architectural design or orientation.

F. Architectural Theme. The structural elements of each PUD, including accessory structures such as signs and lighting, shall be integrated into a primary architectural theme that is carried throughout the development. Metal pole buildings and/or manufactured homes/buildings shall not be permitted in a PUD.

G. Service Improvements. Service improvements in a PUD shall be provided in accordance with applicable RMC provisions including water, sanitary sewer and electrical systems, street improvements, fire hydrants, drainage and other public improvements and/or include necessary measures to make the needed utilities and services available on the site. All utility service facilities, including power, phone and cable lines, shall be placed underground, with the exception of those that, by their nature, must be on or above the surface.

H. Maintenance and Repair of Common Areas. The declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions in each deed to be held by a property owner within the PUD shall require periodic assessments for the ongoing maintenance and repair of all private service facilities held in common. The declaration shall also require that the governing body of the PUD be responsible for the adequate maintenance of such facilities.

I. Project Phasing.

1. If the PUD is designed to be built in phases, each phase shall be clearly delineated on the preliminary PUD plan, physically described, and scheduled for development within the overall PUD schedule.

2. The final plan may also be submitted for the entire PUD or in phases, consistent with a phased preliminary PUD approval. Final plans will not be accepted for partial development if project phasing was not approved at the time of preliminary PUD plan approval.

There is hereby adopted by reference the Pacific County road standards as published by Pacific County during 1999 and a copy of that document shall be maintained on file in the city clerk’s office. (Ord. 1638 § 6, 2001)


15.74.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to define the requirements for street planning and construction to be followed in the development, review, and approval of site plans, subdivisions, short subdivisions, and new development in existing plats. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.020 Construction standards and specifications.

A. Construction and design standards and specifications for streets are contained in the most recent edition of the document entitled Pacific County road standards, and all streets must be completed in accordance with these standards.

B. Curbs, gutters, and sidewalks may be required in all of the city’s commercial zones (GC, RC, HC, and WFC). When required, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks must be constructed according to construction and design standards and specifications for curbs, gutters, and sidewalks contained in the most recent edition of the document entitled Pacific County road standards.

C. If a development accesses an existing street or is proposed at the end of an existing street that is not designed to accommodate the expected increase in traffic caused by the new development, then the developer must improve the existing street leading to the development up to the standards required for the expected increase in traffic (see RMC 15.74.050(B)). Single-family homes, duplexes, and multifamily dwellings up to four units are exempt from this requirement. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.030 Approval of construction drawings required before installation.

A. The city engineer must approve construction plans before any right-of-way improvements may be installed.

B. The right-of-way improvement plans must be prepared by a licensed engineer on 24-inch by 36-inch size mylar reproducible sheet for approval by the city engineer before starting construction.

C. The city engineer may require a survey before construction begins. If a survey is required, a copy of the survey must be given to the city. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.040 Inspection of public improvements required before final permits are issued.

The city engineer or his representative must inspect all public improvement work before any final land use permit or building permit is issued. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.050 Street classification.

A. If a street is dedicated to public use, the street must be classified as provided in subsection (B) of this section. Classification will be based on the following considerations:

1. The projected volume of traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day;

2. The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as an indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive;

3. Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that used to end outside the subdivision, the classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision.

B. The classification of streets must comply with the most current edition of the Pacific County road standards. The following are road or right-of-way classifications based on the anticipated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) 10 years hence:

1. Major collector (ADT 2,000+);

2. Minor collector (ADT 400-2,000);

3. Access collector (ADT 0-400);

4. Cul-de-sac; and

5. Private road. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.060 Street or alley in existing plat used as driveway.

A. In some existing plats in the city, a street is being used as a driveway because all of the lots created at the time that the area was platted have not yet been built upon. In these situations in existing plats, if a street is used as a driveway, either:

1. The property owner using the street as a driveway must at all times maintain it in accordance with the standards for a temporary half street, as outlined in RMC 15.74.090; or

2. The property owner using the street as a driveway must improve it to city street standards and the city will maintain it.

B. Primary access must be by a street. Alleys should only provide a secondary means of access to a lot. If an alley is currently being used as a driveway and new construction will occur, either:

1. A new driveway which connects to a street must be constructed; or

2. If the same person owns the alley and the lot on which new construction will occur, the alley right-of-way must be increased and the alley must be improved to city street standards and maintained in accordance with subsection (A) of this section. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.070 Dedications.

A. Required minimum street right-of-way width is according to construction standards in the Pacific County road standards.

B. Easements must be provided for public facilities and utilities as required by the city.

C. Additional right-of-way may be required to be dedicated as a condition of development approval. In order to conform to minimum standards where developments abut an existing public road or private right-of-way, dedications may be required for extension of the existing public streets or new streets in order to provide continuity with the circulation system. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.080 General layout of streets, blocks, and lots.

A. All streets must be straight, whenever practicable, to the extent necessary to preserve and continue a grid system.

B. All subdivisions and site plans must provide direct access to at least one existing improved and publicly dedicated street.

C. Proposed streets should extend to the boundary lines of the proposed subdivision in order to provide for the future development of adjacent tracts, unless prevented by natural or manmade conditions, or unless an extension is determined to be unnecessary or undesirable by the decision-making body.

D. Street patterns should be designed to expedite traffic movement, reduce conflicts between various types of land uses (including between automobiles and pedestrians), and coordinate the location of proposed buildings with loading and parking facilities.

E. If possible (considering topography), blocks must have sufficient width to provide for a maximum of two tiers of lots of appropriate depths (according to zoning standards), unless existing conditions make this requirement impractical in the judgment of the decision-making body. 

F. The maximum length of residential blocks should be 600 feet, and minimum length should be 300 feet, unless existing conditions make this requirement impractical in the judgment of the decision-making body. 

G. Streets must be laid out so that the lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks adequately address the following:

1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the type of use contemplated;

2. The zoning requirements are able to be met on future building permits;

3. The limitations and opportunities of the topography;

4. The needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic are considered.

H. Lots to be created must comply with the following requirements:

1. Every lot must have a minimum frontage of 50 feet on a public or privately dedicated right-of-way;

2. Every lot must have access to allow emergency vehicles to enter and exit, as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use;

3. Lot lines must be at right angles to street lines or radial to curvilinear streets, unless a variation will result in a better street or lot plan in the opinion of the decision-making body;

4. Dimensions of corner lots must be large enough to allow for front yard setbacks off both streets; and

5. Corner lots must be graded to provide sufficient sight clearance at intersections. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.090 Temporary half street.

Temporary half streets (i.e., streets that have less than the full required right-of-way and pavement width) may be allowed at the discretion of the decision-making body under the following conditions: 

A. Where the street, when combined with an existing street, a street built simultaneously, or a street anticipated to be built within a reasonable time frame on property adjacent to a subdivision, creates a street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this code;

B. Where no more than five dwelling units will use the half street;

C. Where a temporary half street is allowed, the first half of the half street to be built must be paved, at a minimum, to a width equal to three-quarters of the ultimate paved width;

D. Where a public right-of-way easement has been or is being dedicated to the city over those portions of the adjacent property to be used as a half street. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.100 Coordination with surrounding streets.

A. The street system of a new subdivision or in an existing plat where new development is proposed must be coordinated with existing, proposed, and anticipated streets outside the subdivision or existing plat (hereafter referred to as “surrounding streets”). 

B. Minor collector streets must intersect with surrounding major collector streets at safe and convenient locations. 

C. Access collector streets must connect with surrounding streets where necessary:

1. To permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods;

2. To facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles; or

3. For other sufficient reasons, but connections will not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage the use of such streets by substantial through traffic.

D. Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this section:

1. The street right-of-way must be extended; and

2. The street must be developed to the property line of the subdivided property or existing plat at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected.

E. In addition, the permit-issuing authority may require temporary turnarounds to be constructed at the end of the streets described in subsection (D) of this section, pending their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency vehicles. 

F. No temporary dead end streets in excess of 600 feet may be created unless no other practicable alternative is available. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.110 Relationship of streets to topography.

A. Streets must be designed to facilitate drainage and stormwater runoff, and street grades must conform as closely as practicable to the original topography.

B. The maximum grade at any point on a street must not exceed 15 percent unless no other practicable alternative is available. However, in no case may streets be constructed with grades that create a substantial danger to the public safety in the professional opinion of the city engineer. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.120 Cul-de-sacs/turnarounds.

Cul-de-sacs and turnarounds on both public and private streets must conform to the construction standards in the Pacific County road standards. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.130 Entrances to streets (driveways).

Driveway standards in new subdivisions and new development in existing lots must conform to the construction standards in the Pacific County road standards. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.140 Street intersection.

In addition to the intersection standards outlined in the Pacific County road standards, the following standards apply to new subdivisions and new development in existing lots:

A. Streets must intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no two streets may intersect at less than 60 degrees.

B. Not more than two streets may intersect at any one point, unless the city engineer certifies to the permit-issuing authority that such an intersection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.

C. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street must coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) must occur at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets must be evaluated and designed according to accepted traffic safety standards. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.150 Public streets and private roads.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all lots created after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title must abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access requirement set forth in RMC 15.74.130.

B. For purposes of this section, the term “public street” includes a preexisting public street as well as a street created by a subdivider that meets the public street standards of this chapter and is dedicated for public use. The recording of a plat must dedicate the street.

C. Private roads will not be allowed in subdivided developments of five or more lots.

D. Private roads may be allowed through the short plat process only where they provide access for four or fewer lots.

E. If a private road is used and an adjacent property is capable of being short platted with a private road, the roads must be located in such a way as to allow them to be combined into one 60-foot right-of-way in the event that the property owners wish to improve and dedicate it as a public street.

F. Private roads in planned residential developments (see Chapter 15.46 RMC) must be built to the same standards as public roads. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.160 Right-of-way improvements and dedication to precede development or building.

A. Except as noted under subsection (C) of this section, no land use permit or building permit will be issued by the city unless or until the public rights-of-way upon which the subject property abuts are:

1. Considered fully improved (see subsection (B) of this section) to the standards of the right-of-way classification (as specified in RMC 15.74.070); and

2. Offered for dedication to the public.

B. The city engineer will consider subsection (A) of this section fulfilled if the circumstances listed below are met. It will be at the discretion of the city engineer, based on knowledge of upcoming projects in the vicinity, safety issues, or sound engineering judgment, as to which method will be allowed or not allowed. Improvements will be considered fully installed:

1. Where the right-of-way are already improved to their classification standards and dedicated to the city;

2. Where the city chooses to purchase right-of-way and install the improvements. However, under no circumstances is the city obligated to do this;

3. Where the applicant installs the improvements himself at his own cost and offers the rights-of-way to the public;

4. Where the applicant has dedicated the rights-of-way to the public and posted a completion security with the city engineer in accordance with RMC 15.02.130. The completion security will guarantee the completion of road and/or drainage improvements that are required;

5. If subsections (B)(1) through (B)(4) of this section are declared unfeasible by the city engineer, then improvements will be considered fully installed if the applicant has dedicated the rights-of-way to the public and elected to pay to the city an amount equal to the cost of installing the improvements. In such circumstances, the funds would be maintained in an account to be used specifically for improvements on that right-of-way within the general vicinity of the project;

6. A maintenance security may be required if work is not complete at the time of the first sale of property out of the developer’s possession.

C. This section does not apply to:

1. Building permits for additions, alterations, or repairs within any 12-month period which does not increase the gross floor space of an existing building or facility by more than 50 percent; or

2. Building permits for residential garages, carports, or accessory structures not intended as a dwelling unit. (Ord. 1593, 1998)


15.74.170 Attention to disabled persons in street and sidewalk construction.

a. Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential co-location applicant, in exchange for a reasonable fee not in excess of the actual cost of preparing a response;

b. Negotiate in good faith for shared use of the WCF by third parties; and

c. Allow shared use of the WCF if an applicant agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges for co-location.

2. Radio Frequency Standards. The applicant shall comply with all applicable FCC RF emissions standards (FCC Guidelines).

3. Noise. Noise levels shall not exceed five dBA above ambient levels or 55 dBA sound pressure level (SPL), whichever is greater, on adjacent properties. Operation of a back-up generator in the event of power failure or the testing of a back-up generator between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. are exempt from this standard. No testing of back-up power generators shall occur between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.

4. Environmental Resource Protection. All wireless communication facilities shall be sited so as to minimize the effect on environmental resources. Alteration or disturbance of native vegetation and topography shall be minimized.

5. A WCF shall make available unutilized space for co-location of other telecommunication facilities, including space for these entities providing similar competing services.

B. Siting Requirements.

1. A proposal for a new wireless communication service tower shall not be approved unless the review authority finds that the wireless communication equipment for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or structure due to one or more of the following four reasons:

a. The wireless communication equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or structure, as documented by a Washington State licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower/structure cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost;

b. The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or structure as documented by a Washington State licensed professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;

c. Existing or approved towers and structures within the applicant’s search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a licensed professional engineer; and

d. The radio frequency coverage objective cannot be adequately met.

Additionally, the review authority may choose to waive this co-location requirement if clear and convincing evidence is presented which shows that the amortized cost of constructing the proposed WCF (using a reasonable interest rate and a reasonably projected useful life of the proposed WCF) is at least 10 percent less than the projected amortized cost (using a reasonable interest rate) of renting space on an existing WCF for the reasonably projected useful life of the proposed WCF.

2. All co-located and multiple-user WCFs shall be designed to promote facility and site sharing.

3. Existing sites for potential co-location, may include but are not limited to buildings, water towers, existing WCFs, utility poles and towers, and related facilities; provided, that such installation preserves the character and integrity of those sites. In particular, applicants are urged to consider use of existing telephone and electrical utility structures as sites for their WCF.

4. If co-location is not feasible, the preferred order for locating proposed WCFs shall be based on the following zoning designations:

a. Heavy Manufacturing (M-2), outside of shoreline management jurisdiction;

b. Light Manufacturing (M-1), outside of shoreline management jurisdiction;

c. Heavy Manufacturing (M-2), within shoreline management jurisdiction;

d. Light Manufacturing (M-1), within shoreline management jurisdiction.

[Note: Priorities “(a)” through “(d)” refer to areas designated in the city of Raymond comprehensive plan.]

The review authority shall not allow a WCF to be sited in a particular area designated in the city of Raymond comprehensive plan unless the applicant demonstrates with clear and convincing evidence that the applicant’s objectives cannot be met by placing the project in an area with a higher preference (e.g., before a WCF can be placed in a Light Manufacturing area, the applicant must show that his/her objectives cannot be met by placing the project in an area designated as Heavy Manufacturing).

5. Visual Compatibility. In addition to satisfying the preferred order for location under subsection (B)(4) of this section, the applicant also shall demonstrate that the proposed WCF will be visually compatible. To the extent practicable, the applicant shall use concealment technology and/or vegetatively, topographically, or structurally screen the WCF to minimize visual impacts. Existing trees or significant vegetation should be retained to the greatest possible degree in order to help conceal a facility or tower. Vegetation of a similar species and a size acceptable to the approval authority shall be planted immediately following the loss of any vegetation used to conceal a facility or tower. Vegetation used to demonstrate visual compatibility shall be under the control of the applicant/co-applicant or tenant.

6. Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the applicant’s antennas and comparable antennas for at least two additional facilities if the tower is over 100 feet in height or for at least one additional facility if the tower is between 60 and 100 feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.

7. Towers/monopoles shall not be sited in locations where there is no vegetative, structural, or topographic screening available.

8. The city engineer may require independent verification of the analysis provided by the applicant at the applicant’s expense.

9. Height. The review authority shall not approve a tower exceeding 60 feet in height unless the applicant demonstrates with clear and convincing evidence that the applicants objectives cannot be met with a tower of lesser height. In no case shall a tower in excess of 120 feet be approved.

Wireless communication facilities shall comply with the following requirements:

a. Ground-mounted WCFs in the following areas shall not exceed the following height restrictions:

i. Heavy/Light Manufacturing Zones Outside Shoreline Management Jurisdiction. WCFs located in Heavy or Light Manufacturing zones may be a maximum height of 120 feet may be approved with conditional use permit.

ii. Heavy/Light Manufacturing Zones within Shoreline Jurisdiction. WCFs located in Heavy or Light Manufacturing zones within the shoreline management jurisdiction may be permitted up to 35 feet in height. WCFs up to a maximum of 60 feet may be permitted with a conditional use and a shoreline management variance permit.

WCFs located within the city’s shoreline management jurisdiction must comply with the permitting requirements of the city’s shoreline management master program.

b. WCFs attached to existing structures or natural objects shall not exceed the height limitation for the area listed above.

10. Setback/Yard Requirements. Setback requirements shall be measured from the outside edge of a WCF/accessory structure(s).

a. No structure on the subject property shall be closer to a ground-mounted facility than a distance equal to the total height of the WCF measured from finished grade.

b. All ground-mounted towers shall be setback from any property line a minimum distance equal to the total height of the tower.

The review authority may waive the setback requirements in this subsection if clear and convincing evidence is presented which shows that placing the proposed WCF/accessory structure(s) within a setback area would make the proposal more visually compatible.

11. Storage.

a. Wireless communication storage facilities (i.e., vaults, equipment rooms, utilities, and equipment cabinets or enclosures) shall be constructed of nonreflective materials (exterior surfaces only). The placement of equipment in underground vaults is encouraged.

b. Wireless communication storage facilities shall be no taller than one story (15 feet) in height and shall be treated to look like a building or facility typically found in the areas.

12. Color and Materials. All buildings, poles, towers, antenna supports, antennas, and other components of each wireless communication site shall initially be colored with “flat” muted tones. The color selected shall be one that in the opinion of the approval authority minimizes visibility of the WCF to the greatest extent feasible. 

13. Fences.

a. A security fence with a minimum height of six feet shall be installed around the perimeter of all WCF sites. The fence shall be posted with appropriate warning signs. Vegetative screening shall be planted around the fence in accordance with subsection (B)(7) of this section. Security is the responsibility of the applicant/owner.

b. A sight-obscuring fence shall be installed and maintained around the perimeter of the lease area of a ground-mounted facility not employing concealment technology. The sight-obscuring fence shall surround the tower and the equipment shelter.

c. A ground-mounted facility located in a public right-of-way must be exempted from fencing requirements.

d. Chain link fences shall be painted or coated with a nonreflective color.

14. Security. In the event a fence is required, WCFs shall insure that sufficient anti-climbing measures have been incorporated into the facility, as needed, to reduce potential for trespass and injury.

15. Lighting.

a. A new WCF shall only be illuminated as necessary to comply with FAA or other applicable state and federal requirements.

b. No other exterior lighting shall be permitted on premises.

c. Exterior lighting shall be reflected away from buildings.

16. Signs. The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited.

17. Landscape and Screening. All WCFs shall be improved in such a manner so as to maintain and enhance existing native vegetation and suitable landscaping installed to screen the base of the tower and all accessory equipment, where necessary. To this end, all of the following measures shall be implemented for all ground-mounted WCFs including accessory structures.

a. A landscape plan shall be submitted indicating all existing vegetation, landscaping that is to be retained within the leased area on the site, and any additional vegetation that is needed to satisfactorily screen the facility from adjacent land and public view areas. Planted vegetation shall be of the evergreen variety and placed outside of the fence. All trees, larger than four inches in diameter and four and a half feet high shall be identified in the landscape plan by species type, and whether it is to be retained or removed with project development;

b. Existing trees and other screening vegetation in the vicinity of the facility and along the access drive and any power/telecommunication line routes involved shall be protected from damage, during the construction period;

c. The review authority may waive landscaping and screening requirements if he or she finds that the waiver of these requirements will not engender any significant visual or aesthetic impacts. (Ord. 1659, 2002)


15.88.100 Insurance.

The applicant shall maintain public liability insurance and submit proof of insurance to the city. (Ord. 1659, 2002)


15.88.110 Maintenance.

A. The applicant/co-applicant or tenant shall maintain the WCF. Such maintenance shall include, but shall not be limited to, painting, maintaining structural integrity, and landscaping.

B. In the event the applicant/co-applicant or tenant/carrier fails to maintain the facility in accordance with permit conditions regarding visual impacts or public safety, the city of Raymond may undertake the maintenance at the expense of the applicant or co-applicant landowner. (Ord. 1659, 2002)


15.88.120 Abandonment.

A. At such time that a carrier plans to abandon or discontinue, or is required to discontinue, the operation of a WCF, such carrier will notify the city of Raymond public works department in writing of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operations. Such notice shall be given no less than 30 days prior to abandonment or discontinuation of operations.

B. In the event that a carrier fails to give such notice, the WCF shall be considered abandoned if the antenna or tower is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months, unless the owner of said tower provides proof of continued maintenance on a quarterly basis.

C. Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the person who constructed the facility, the person who operated the facility, carrier, or the property owner shall physically remove the WCF within 90 days from the date of abandonment or discontinuation of use. “Physically remove” shall include, but not be limited to:

1. Removal of the antenna(s), mounts, equipment cabinets, security barriers, and foundations down to three feet below ground surface;

2. Transportation of the antenna(s), mount, equipment cabinets, and security barriers to an appropriate disposal site; and

3. Restoring the site of the WCF to its preconstruction condition, except any remaining landscaping and grading.

The owner of the facility shall pay all site reclamation costs deemed necessary and reasonable to return the site to its preconstruction condition.

D. If a party fails to remove a WCF in accordance with subsection (C) of this section, the city of Raymond shall have the authority to enter the subject property and physically remove the facility. Costs for the removal of the WCF shall be charged to the landowner of record in the event the city of Raymond removes the facility.

E. If there are two or more carriers/operators of a single tower, then provisions of subsection (D) of this section shall not become effective until all carriers/operators cease using the tower. (Ord. 1659, 2002)

17.04.010 Amendments – Purpose and introduction.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for amending the Raymond comprehensive plan, defined for the purposes of this chapter as including the plan text and/or the land use map. The Growth Management Act (GMA, Chapter 36.70A RCW) generally allows amendments to comprehensive plans no more often than once per year, except in emergency situations. This chapter is intended to provide the following:

1. A process whereby the city will compile and maintain a preliminary docket of proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan and then select which proposed amendments will be placed on the final docket for review, no more often than once annually;

2. Timelines and procedures for placing formal applications for amendments by interested parties (i.e., project proponents or property owners) on the final docket for review, no more often than once annually; and

3. Criteria for review of the final docket by the city of Raymond planning commission and the city council. This chapter is also intended to provide a process for the planning commission to monitor and assess the comprehensive plan, and based on this review to recommend amendments (if any) to the plan as part of a standardized amendment process.

B. Public Participation. The public participation process set forth in this chapter is intended to solicit from the public suggested amendments to the Raymond comprehensive plan for future consideration, and to provide an opportunity for public comment on any proposed amendments. This is achieved by early and continuous public involvement with broad dissemination of proposals and alternatives, opportunity for written comments, public meetings after effective notice, provisions for open discussion, information services, and consideration and response to public comments.

C. Planning Commission Role. The Raymond planning commission is an advisory body that shall make recommendations to the city council on all comprehensive plan matters, including amendments to the plan text and land use map, implementing regulations and subarea plans.

D. Applicability. Amendments to the text of the comprehensive plan, the land use map, and the implementing regulations are legislative decisions. Accordingly, all legislative procedures apply to the decision-making process adopted in this chapter, regardless of whether or not they are specifically referred to herein. (Ord. 1809 § 5, 2013)


17.04.020 Annual amendments – Consideration of cumulative effects. 

Except as provided in RMC 17.04.030, proposals for amendments to the Raymond comprehensive plan shall be considered by the city council no more frequently than once every year. Proposals for plan amendment shall be considered concurrently so that the cumulative effect of all items on the final docket will be ascertained. Proposals may be considered at separate meetings or hearings, so long as the final action taken considers the cumulative effect of all the proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1809 § 5, 2013)


17.04.030 Exceptions to the annual amendment process.

A. Exceptions – Emergencies. In addition to the amendment process set forth in this chapter, the city council may amend the Raymond comprehensive plan in any of the following circumstances:

1. Resolution of an emergency condition or situation that involves public health, safety, or welfare and when adherence to the amendment process set forth in this chapter would be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare;

2. Initial adoption of a subarea plan identified in the Raymond comprehensive plan;

3. The adoption of or amendments to the Raymond shoreline master program; 

4. Technical, nonsubstantive corrections to manifest land use mapping errors which do not involve interpretations of the criteria for the various land use designations contained in the comprehensive plan;

5. Resolution of a decision by an administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction; and

6. Special use permits for essential public facilities.

B. Determination of Emergency. Situations involving official legal or administrative action (e.g., decisions by the Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board, state or federal courts, actions of a state agency or office, or the state legislature) affecting the city of Raymond will be reviewed by the Raymond city council with advice from the city attorney’s office to determine whether an emergency exists warranting an emergency comprehensive plan amendment. (Ord. 1809 § 5, 2013)


17.04.040 Applications for comprehensive plan amendment.

A. Who May Propose Amendments – Application – Fee. 

1. Applications for Formal Site-Specific Amendments. Proponents of land development projects (for multiple sites) and/or property owner(s) or their authorized representative(s) may file an application for a proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan relating to a site-specific proposal (“formal site-specific amendments”). A filing fee as set forth in the Raymond fee ordinance shall accompany applications for site-specific amendments.

2. Applications for Suggested Amendments. Anyone may apply for a “suggested amendment” to the comprehensive plan which shall be added to the list of proposed amendments to be maintained by the city planner. Generally, applications for suggested amendments should be limited to proposals that broadly apply to the goals, policies and implementation strategies of the comprehensive plan rather than amendments designed to address site-specific issues of limited applicability. The process outlined in RMC 17.04.060 shall govern whether such suggested amendments are considered during the annual review process. No application fee shall be required for applications for suggested amendments.

B. Application Deadline – Form. 

1. Deadline. All applications for formal site-specific and suggested amendments shall be submitted to the city planner by March 1st of the current calendar year in order to be considered during that year’s amendment process; except that city-sponsored proposals to amend the capital facilities element of the comprehensive plan may be accepted later than other proposed amendments because of their relationship to the city’s annual budget process.

2. Application Form. All proposed amendments (i.e., both formal site-specific and suggested) shall be submitted to the planner on forms provided by the city and shall include the following information, as determined by the city planner to be necessary to evaluate a particular proposal:

a. Name and address of applicant;

b. A description of the proposed comprehensive plan amendment and any associated development proposals, if applicable. Formal site-specific or project-related amendments shall include plans, information and/or studies that accurately depict existing and proposed use(s) and improvements. Proposed site-specific or project-related comprehensive plan amendments that do not specify proposed use(s) and potential impacts will be assumed to have maximum impact to the environment and public facilities and services;

c. Proposed amendatory language, preferably shown in a “bill” format (i.e., new language underlined; language proposed for deletion in strikeouts);

d. An explanation of the rationale for the proposed amendment;

e. An explanation of how the proposed amendment and associated development proposal(s), if any, conform to, conflict with, or relate to the criteria set forth in RMC 17.04.080(A)(3) and (A)(4), as applicable;

RMC 17.04.060 sets forth the process for selecting which suggested amendments will be placed on the final docket to be formally reviewed during the annual review process.

C. Formal Site-Specific Amendments. The preliminary docket shall also include all formal site-specific applications for comprehensive plan amendments. Formal site-specific applications for amendments that are properly and timely filed under RMC 17.04.040(B)(1) shall be placed on the final docket for consideration during the current annual amendment process.

D. Planning Commission Periodic Assessment – Recommendations.
