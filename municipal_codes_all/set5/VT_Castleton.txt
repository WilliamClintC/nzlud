ARTICLE IV: USES PERMITTED SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS
A zoning permit shall be issued by the Administrative Officer for any use or structure which requires conditional use approval only after the Development Review Board grants such approval. In considering its action, the Board shall make findings upon both general and specific standards set forth in these regulations. Except as specifically provided herein, no Board may amend, alter, invalidate or affect any plan or by-law of any municipality or the implementation or enforcement thereof, or allow any use not permitted by any Zoning Regulations or other by-laws.
In addition to any specific conditions of Sections 403 through 415, the Development Review Board shall determine that the proposed conditional use
shall not result in an undue adverse effect on any of the following:
A. The capacity of existing or planned community facilities;
B. The character of the area affected, as defined by the purpose or purposes of the zoning district within which the project is located and specifically stated policies and standards of the municipal plan;
C. Traffic on roads and highways;
D. Use of renewable energy resources; and
E. Bylaws and ordinances in effect.

1. That there are unique physical circumstances, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances generally created by the provisions of the Zoning Regulations in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
2. That as a result of such physical problems, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Regulations and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
3. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
4. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare, and
5. That such variance if authorized represents the minimum that will afford relief, and provide the least modification possible of the Zoning Regulations and of the comprehensive plan.
B. In rendering a decision in favor of an appellant under this section, the
76
Development Review Board may attach such conditions to the variance as it considers necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the various purposes of these Regulations and the town plan then in effect.

A. Requests for waivers of dimensional requirements are considered by the Development Review Board.
B. Waivers will be granted to allow for minor additions to a principle accessory structure that would not be counter to the purpose of this Bylaw or the Town Plan, but which might not meet the standards for the granting of a variance.
C. A waiver may be granted only to reduce dimensional requirements as provided below, and compliance with all other requirements of this Bylaw is required. The Development Review Board may grant a waiver provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
1. The proposal is for an addition to an existing principle or accessory structure, and said addition does not increase the footprint of the structure by more than 200 square feet.
2. The addition is the minimum size that is necessary for it to serve its intended function.

A. On an appeal where a variance from the provisions of a zoning regulation is requested for a structure that is primarily a renewable energy resource structure, the Board may grant such variances, and render a decision in favor of the appellant if all of the following facts are found and the finding is specified in its decision.
1. It is unusually difficult or unduly expensive for the appellant to build a suitable renewable energy resource structure in conformance with the regulations; and
2. That the hardship was not created by the appellant; and
3. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
4. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the zoning regulation and from the plan.
B. In rendering a decision in favor of an appellant under this section, the Development Review Board may attach such conditions to the variance as it considers necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the various purposes of these Regulations and the town plan then in effect.

2. For all other types of development review, including site plan review, public notice for hearings shall be given not less than seven days prior to the date of the public hearing, and shall include at a minimum:
a. the posting of the date, place, and purpose of the hearing in three or more public places within the municipality in conformance with the time and location requirements of 1 V.S.A. § 312(c)(2); and
3. The applicant may be required to bear the cost of the public warning and the cost and responsibility of notification of adjoining landowners.
B. Decisions
1. The development review panel shall render a decision on all development review applications not more than 45 days from the close of evidence at the public hearing, and failure to so act within this period shall be deemed approval. The board shall close the evidence promptly after the applicant and all interested persons have submitted information. Decisions shall be issued in writing and shall include a statement of the factual bases on which the development review panel has made its conclusions and a statement of the conclusions. The minutes of the meeting may suffice, provided the factual bases and conclusions relating to the review standards are provided in conformance with this subsection.
79
2. In rendering a decision in favor of the applicant, the panel may attach additional reasonable conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter and the pertinent bylaws and the municipal plan then in effect. A bond, escrow account, or other surety in a form acceptable to the legislative body of the municipality may be required to assure one or more of the following: the completion of the project, adequate stabilization, or protection of public facilities that may be affected by a project.
3. Any decision shall be sent by certified mail within the period set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection to the applicant and the appellant in matters on appeal. Copies of the decision shall also be mailed to every person or body appearing and having been heard at the hearing and a copy of the decision shall be filed with the administrative officer and the clerk of the municipality as a part of the public records of the municipality.
4. Conditions may require that no zoning permit, except for any permits that may be required for infrastructure construction, may be issued for an approved development unless the streets and other required public improvements have been satisfactorily installed in accordance with the approval decision and pertinent bylaws. In lieu of the completion of the required public improvements, the development review panel may require from the owner for the benefit of the municipality a performance bond issued either by a bonding or surety company approved by the legislative body or by the owner with security acceptable to the legislative body, in an amount sufficient to cover the full cost of those new streets and required improvements on or in those streets or highways and their maintenance for a period of two years after completion as is estimated by the development review panel or such municipal departments or officials as the panel may designate. This bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public, the completion of any improvements which may be required within the period fixed in the subdivision bylaws for that completion, and for the maintenance of those improvements for a period of two years after completion.
5. The performance bond required by this subsection shall run for a term to be fixed by the development review panel, but in no case for a longer term than three years. However, with the consent of the owner, the term of that bond may be extended for an additional
80
period not to exceed three years. If any required improvements have not been installed or maintained as provided within the term of the performance bond, the bond shall be forfeited to the municipality and upon receipt of the proceeds of the bond, the municipality shall install or maintain such improvements as are covered by the performance bond.
C. Administrative review. In addition to the delegation of powers authorized under this chapter, any bylaws adopted under this chapter may establish procedures under which the administrative officer may review and approve new development and amendments to previously approved development that would otherwise require review by a development review panel. If administrative review is authorized, the bylaws shall clearly specify the thresholds and conditions under which the administrative officer classifies and application as eligible for administrative review. The threshold and conditions shall be structured such that no new development shall be approved that results in a substantial impact under any of the standards set forth in the bylaws. No amendment issued as an administrative review shall have the effect of substantively altering any of the findings of fact of the most recent approval.
Any decision by an administrative officer under this subsection may be appealed to the Development Review Board.
Section 1211: Minutes and Findings
The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, indicating the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating this, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the clerk of the municipality as a public record.
All findings and actions of the Board shall be in writing and shall include the reasons for the action taken irrespective of its nature. Findings shall be detailed and in specific terms, discussing the reason for the decisions, beyond such generalities as "in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare." In every instance, a statement of the facts upon which such action is based shall appear in the decision.
81
