(B) In accordance with 10 V.S.A. Chapter 32 and V.S.A Chapter 117, Sections 4424, 4411, and 4414, these bylaws hereby incorporate regulations for areas at risk of flood damage in the Town of Hardwick, Vermont.
Section 1.2 Purpose
(A) The purposes of the Unified Development Bylaws are to:
? encourage the appropriate and efficient use of all lands in the Town of Hardwick in a manner which promotes and protects public health, safety and the general welfare of the community;
? facilitate the adequate and efficient provision of public facilities and services;
? implement the Hardwick Town Plan as most
recently amended;
? integrate all administrative and regulatory provisions of zoning, subdivision, flood hazard, and telecommunication regulations as authorized by the Act into a single Bylaw;
? further the goals and purposes established in the Act [§4302];
? avoid and minimize the loss of life and property, the disruption of commerce, the impairment of the tax base, and the extraordinary public expenditures and demands on public services that result from flooding;
? ensure that the selection, design, creation, and use of development is reasonably safe and accomplished in a manner that is consistent with public wellbeing, does not impair floodplain services,
? manage the flood hazard area designated pursuant to 10 V.S.A. Chapter 32 § 753, the municipal hazard mitigation plan; and make the Town of Hardwick, its citizens, and businesses eligible for federal flood insurance, federal disaster recovery funds, and hazard mitigation funds as may be available; and
? protect the individual property rights of landowners to the extent consistent with the other purposes of these Bylaws as stated above.

Section 1.3 Application & Interpretation
(A) The application of these Bylaws is subject to all provisions of the Act.

ARTICLE 2. ZONING DISTRICTS
Section 2.1 Establishment of Zoning Districts & Map
(A) The Town of Hardwick is hereby divided into the following zoning districts as described in the accompanying tables (Tables 2.1 - 2.8) and shown on the official zoning map and associated overlays:
? Central Business (CB) District
? Village Neighborhood (VN) District
? Highway Mixed-Use (HM) District
? Compact Residential (CR) District
? Industrial (I) District
? Rural Residential (RR) District
? Forest Reserve (FR) District
? Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO) District
(B) The location and boundaries of each zoning district are depicted on the official “Town of Hardwick Zoning Map” and on the most current flood insurance studies and maps published by the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance Program maps, which are adopted by reference and declared to be part of these bylaws. The official zoning map may only be altered by amendment to these bylaws in accordance with Section 1.4 and the Act [§§4441, 4442].
(C) The official zoning map and overlays shall be located in the Hardwick Town Office, and shall be identified by the signatures of the Selectboard, as attested to by the Town Clerk. These maps shall be the final authority as to the zoning status of any lands or waters in the town.
Section 2.2 Zoning District Boundary Interpretation
(A) Where uncertainty exists as to the location of district boundaries shown on the official zoning map and overlays, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Boundaries indicated as following roads, transportation or utility rights-of-way shall be interpreted to follow the centerlines of such features.
(2) Boundaries indicated as following rivers or streams shall be interpreted to follow the channel centerline and shall move with the centerline of such features.
(3) Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be interpreted as the normal mean water level. In the event of change in the shoreline the boundary shall move with the shoreline.
(4) Boundaries indicated as following lot lines shall be interpreted to follow the delineated property boundary.
(5) Boundaries indicated as following contour lines shall be interpreted to follow a constant, specified elevation as measured from mean sea level or other accepted reference datum.
(6) Boundaries indicated as following compass headings shall be interpreted to follow
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 7
such headings.
(7) Boundaries indicated as parallel or perpendicular to, or extensions of the above features, shall be so interpreted on the ground.
(8) Distances not specifically indicated shall be determined by the scale on the official zoning map.
(B) The abandonment or relocation of a right-of-way or roadway, or the change in a line or feature which references a district boundary line, after the effective date of these bylaws, shall not affect the location of the district boundary line except with regard to shorelines, streams and rivers as specified above.
(C) Where available, base flood elevations and floodway limits provided by the National Flood Insurance Program and in the Flood Insurance Study and accompanying maps shall be used to administer and enforce these regulations. In Special Flood Hazard Areas where base flood elevations and/or floodway limits have not been provided by the National Flood Insurance Program in the Flood Insurance Study and accompanying maps, it is the applicant’s responsibility to develop the necessary data. Where available, the applicant shall use data provided by FEMA, or State, or Federal agencies.
(D) When the Zoning Administrator cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary, the Development Review Board and/or appropriate state or federal official may be consulted prior to issuing a determination. A determination by the Zoning Administrator regarding the location of a district boundary may be appealed to the Development Review Board under Section 7.3. If the applicant appeals the determination of the Flood Hazard Overlay boundary made by the Zoning Administrator, a Letter of Map Amendment from FEMA shall constitute proof.
(E) Where a district boundary divides a lot in single ownership as of the effective date of these bylaws, or any amendment thereto, the Development Review Board may permit, subject to conditional use review under Section 5.2, the extension of district standards for either portion of the lot up to 30 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
(F) Where a lot is divided by a town boundary, the standards of these bylaws shall be applied to that portion of the lot located in the Town of Hardwick in the same manner as if the entire lot were located in this town.
Section 2.3 Application of District Standards
(A) All uses and structures, unless specifically exempted under Section 7.2, must comply with all prescribed standards for the district in which they are located, as set forth in Tables 2.1-2.8 and as defined in Section 8.2, unless otherwise specified in these bylaws. The standards for each district shall apply uniformly to each class of use or structure, unless otherwise specified. Nonconforming uses and noncomplying structures in lawful existence as of the effective date of these bylaws shall be regulated in accordance with Section 3.9.
(B) Overlay district standards shall be applied concurrently with the standards for underlying zoning districts. Where overlay districts impose more restrictive standards on the use of land or a structure, the standards of the overlay district shall apply.
(C) Uses for each district are classified as - “permitted uses” to be reviewed by the Zoning

ARTICLE 3. GENERAL REGULATIONS
Section 3.1 Applicability
The following general standards, including provisions required under the Act [§4412, §4413], apply to all uses and structures as specified within the Town of Hardwick.
Section 3.2 Damaged Structures
(A) No zoning permit is required for the stabilization of damaged structures located outside of the Flood Hazard Overlay District to prevent hazards to public health or safety, or to adjoining properties, structures or uses (e.g., fire, collapse, squatting); nor for the timely repair or reconstruction of damaged structures to the extent of their prior condition and use, provided such stabilization, repair or reconstruction occurs within 12 months of the date the structure is damaged. Reconstruction that results in changes in density, dimension or use under applicable provisions of these regulations shall require a zoning permit issued in accordance with Section 7.1.
(B) If an owner has not stabilized, repaired or reconstructed a structure that has been demolished, destroyed, or substantially damaged within 12 months of the date of damage or demolition, and the structure is determined by the Town Health Officer to present a hazard to public health and safety, the owner shall remove all materials from the site, restore the site to a normal grade, and establish ground cover sufficient to prevent erosion.
(C) The repair or reconstruction of damaged structures located in the Flood Hazard Overlay District shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.3 of these Bylaws.
Section 3.3 Access & Frontage Requirements
(A) No land development may be permitted on lots which do not have either frontage on a public or private road or public waters or, with the approval of the Development Review Board, access to such a road or waters by a permanent easement, right-of-way or fee-simple ownership at least 50 feet in width and fully located outside of the Flood Hazard Overlay District. In granting approval under this Section, the Development Review Board shall consider the intended use and shall ensure the proposed access does not pose a hazard to traffic and pedestrian safety.
(B) The approval of access to a non-frontage lot shall be done in Site Plan Review as provided in Section 5.1 unless the proposed development is subject to other development review processes such as Conditional Use Review, Planned Unit Development, or Subdivision Review. In that case, the review and approval of access shall be incorporated into the appropriate development review process.
(B) Access onto public roads is subject to the approval of the Hardwick Selectboard, and for state highways, the Vermont Agency of Transportation. As a condition of access approval, compliance with all municipal land use regulations is required. Access permits must be obtained prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.
(C) With the exception of parcels in agricultural or forestry use, no lot created after the effective date of these bylaws shall be served by more than one (1) access or driveway unless otherwise approved under conditional use review in accordance with Section 5.2. The consolidation of existing accesses and/or shared access between adjoining lots is encouraged and may be required as a condition of such approval. Access widths shall be
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 19
limited to that approved, and not extend along the length of road frontage.

(2) An accessory structure such as a garage or barn may be converted to a principal use allowed within the district in which it is located only if the structure is located on a separate lot which conforms to lot size, setback, parking and other requirements applicable to the proposed use, independent of the principal use or structure on the lot (see Section 3.8). Such a conversion requires a zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with Section 7.1.
(3) A conversion or change of use from one permitted use to another permitted use which involves the creation of new floor space or outdoor storage space, requires additional on-site parking, or has different minimum lot size or dimensional requirements, will require a zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator under Section 7.1.
(4) A conversion or change from a permitted use to a conditional use, or from a conditional use to a different conditional use, shall be approved by the Development Review Board subject to conditional use review under Section 5.2. Such a change of use shall constitute the discontinuance of a previously approved conditional use unless the Board specifically authorizes the continuation of the prior use as part of its approval under Section 5.2. A landowner may not reconvene the discontinued use without Board approval.
(5) A conversion or change of use involving a non-conforming use and/or Nonconforming structure is also subject to review under Section 3.9.

In addition, the Board may specify as a condition of approval lower densities of development, increased frontage or setback distances, increased buffer areas, and/or designated building envelopes that limit the area to be used for structures and parking, as necessary to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to the character of the area, to significant natural and historic resources identified in the town plan or through site investigation, or to adjoining properties and uses.
(2) Performance Standards. All conditional uses shall meet performance standards as specified in Section 3.11. In determining appropriate performance standards for a particular use, the Board may consult with state regulatory officials and consider accepted industry standards. In addition, the Board may limit the hours of operation so that the proposed use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood and area.
(3) Access & Circulation Standards. All conditional uses shall meet applicable access management standards as specified in Section 6.6. The Board, in consultation with the Selectboard and state, may impose conditions as necessary to ensure the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic on and off-site, including but not limited to conditions on the location and number of access and intersection locations, requirements for shared access and/or parking, and provisions for emergency access, parking, service and loading area, snow storage, pedestrian paths and transit facilities (e.g., sheltered bus stops), as appropriate.
(4) Landscaping & Screening Standards. The Board may require landscaping, fencing, screening or site grading as necessary to maintain the character of the area, or to screen unsightly or incompatible uses from town highways, other public rights-of-way, or adjoining properties. Particular consideration will be given to the preservation of existing vegetation, visibility of the development from public vantage points (including roads), and the adequacy of landscaping and screening materials to meet seasonal weather and soil conditions. A landscaping management plan, and surety for up to three years that is acceptable to the Development Review Board, may be required to ensure that required landscaping and screening is properly installed and maintained.
(5) Stormwater Management & Erosion Control Standards. All conditional uses shall incorporate accepted stormwater management and erosion control practices as appropriate for the setting, scale and intensity of the existing and planned development. Development shall be sited and designed to minimize stormwater runoff and erosion during all phases of development. The Board may require the submission of a stormwater management and/or erosion control plan, prepared by a qualified professional, that incorporates accepted management practices recommended by the state in the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual and the Vermont Handbook for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control on Construction Sites, as most recently amended.

b. Buildings should be oriented toward and relate to, both functionally and visually, public streets and/or common greens, parks or plazas, and not be oriented toward parking lots. The front facade should include a main entry-way and pedestrian access to the street. Buildings located on corner lots shall either be oriented toward the major street or include a corner entrance. The Board may impose a maximum setback, relative to adjacent buildings, to achieve a consistent streetscape.
c. New buildings and additions to existing buildings shall be designed to be compatible with, and not stand in contrast to, historic structures located within the district with regard to building scale, massing, materials, orientation and rhythm of openings.
(2) Village Neighborhood District. Within the Village Neighborhood District development shall be designed in accordance with the following standards:
a. The use of front yards shall be limited to landscaping, pedestrian paths and associated pedestrian amenities (e.g., street furniture, pedestrian scale lighting and signs) and driveways. Outdoor storage, parking and loading areas shall not be located within front yards unless the Board finds that the property is a pre-existing building or that no other practical alternative exists.
b. Buildings should be oriented toward and relate to, both functionally and visually, public streets and/or common greens, parks or plazas, and not be oriented toward parking lots. The front facade should include a main entry-way and pedestrian access to the street. The Board may impose a maximum setback, relative to adjacent buildings, to achieve a consistent streetscape.
c. The scale and massing of new buildings, including height, width, street frontage and roof type, shall be compatible and harmonious with surrounding residential structures. Consideration shall be given to buildings serving special civic, social or cultural functions, including places of worship, that may be designed to serve as prominent focal points within the district.
(3) Highway Mixed-Use District. Within the Highway Mixed Use District, development with frontage on state highways (Route 15, Route 14, Route 16) shall be designed in a manner that meets the following standards:
a. Within and contiguous to parking areas, landscaping shall emphasize the use of shade trees to provide a tree canopy, provide separation between parking spaces to avoid large expanses of parking and minimize the visibility of parking areas from off-site. Suitable locations for shade trees include along walkways, in center islands, in between parking spaces and clustered in appropriate locations.
b. A landscaped strip of at least twenty (20) feet shall be provided parallel to the
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 57
road, which may be crossed by driveways and sidewalks. Form, location, and composition of the landscaped strip shall be shown on the site plan and approved by the Development Review Board.
(4) Rural Residential and Compact Residential Districts. Within the Rural Residential and Compact Residential Districts, development shall be designed in accordance with the following standards:
a. Development shall be designed to minimize loss of agricultural land and natural habitat, impact on water quality, and diminishment of the scenic and rural qualities of the site as experienced both on-site and from other vantage points in the Town.
b. Access roads, driveways and utility corridors shall be shared to the extent feasible; and, where sites include linear features such as existing roads, tree lines, stone walls, and/or fence lines, shall follow these features to the extent feasible in order to minimize the loss of productive agricultural and forest land, and to avoid physical and visual impacts.
(5) Forest Reserve District. Development within the Forest District should not detract from the site’s scenic qualities, nor obstruct significant views from public vantage points, and should blend in with the existing landscape. Development shall take into consideration existing contours and forest cover to ensure that adequate opportunities exist for the siting and natural screening of development to minimize site disturbance and visual impacts. The Board may require the submission of a visual impact assessment for conditional uses within this district, and/or require additional screening of structures consistent with the natural and built environment.

(1) The proposed development is in compliance with all the Development Standards in Section 5.3(G)-(H) of this bylaw;
(2) A nonconforming structure that is substantially damaged or destroyed may be reconstructed only in circumstances when the structure cannot be relocated to a less hazardous location on the parcel. The lowest floor of the reconstructed structure must be rebuilt to at or above the base flood elevation, and the structure must otherwise comply with all requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program; and
(3) An individual manufactured home lot in an existing manufactured home park that is vacated shall not be considered a discontinuance or abandonment of nonconformity. Replacement manufactured homes must be placed so as to meet the development standards in this bylaw.
Section 5.4 Planned Unit Development
(A) Applicability. Planned Unit Development (PUD) review procedures and standards may be applied by the Development Review Board at the request of the applicant for any parcel which meets the minimum lot size for the district within which it is located.
(B) Purpose. In accordance with the Act §4417, PUDs are permitted in all zoning districts to allow for innovative and flexible design and development that will promote the most appropriate use of land, and specifically achieve one or more of the following objectives:
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 62
(1) increase density, reduce lot size and/or facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities to provide housing in a cost-effective manner;
(2) cluster residential development to preserve and maintain open space;
(3) protect significant natural, cultural or scenic features as identified in the Hardwick Town Plan, or through site investigation; and/or,
(4) allow for creative design and layout of development, an efficient use of land, and to provide for the integrated mix of housing types.
(C) Review Procedure.
(1) A proposed PUD that requires a subdivision of land shall be reviewed as a Major Subdivision Review as set forth in Section 6.3. Nevertheless, review and approval of a PUD involving the development of one or more conditional uses under this Section shall not exempt the proposed development from review under Section 5.2. The Development Review Board may review and approve one or more conditional uses concurrently with granting PUD approval, or may require the submission of a conditional use application subsequent to PUD approval.
(2) A proposed PUD that requires no subdivision of land shall be reviewed as a conditional use, as set forth in Section 5.2.
(3) In addition to the application requirements specified under Section 6.3 or 5.2, an application for PUD approval shall include a statement describing all proposed modifications, changes or supplements to existing bylaw requirements. Modifications of these bylaws approved by the Development Review Board shall be noted in writing and appended to a plat depicting the project to be filed in the Hardwick Land Records. All other provisions of these bylaws not specifically modified shall remain in effect and be applicable to the project.
(D) General Standards. The modification of zoning regulations by the Development Review Board may be permitted in accordance with the following standards:
(1) The PUD shall be consistent with the Hardwick Town Plan and all other applicable municipal regulations and ordinances currently in effect. The PUD shall also meet all local and state regulations for sewage disposal and the protection of water quality.
(2) The PUD shall represent an effective and unified treatment of the development site, including provisions as appropriate for the preservation or protection of surface and ground waters; wetland, stream bank, floodplain and lake shore areas; significant topographic features, including hilltops and ridgelines; areas of steep slope or shallow soil; significant resource lands, including agricultural and forest land; historic or archaeological sites and structures; natural and critical habitat areas; and open spaces, including scenic views and vistas.
(3) The Development Review Board may allow for a greater concentration or intensity of development within some section(s) of the development than in others, on individual lots which are smaller than the minimum lot size for the district within which the PUD is located, provided that there is an offset by a lesser concentration in other sections, including the reservation of no less than 50% of the remaining land as open space.
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 63
(4) The minimum front, side and rear yard setbacks at the periphery of the PUD shall be as dictated for the particular district unless otherwise specified by the Development Review Board. The Board may allow other setback standards, such as zero setbacks from lot lines, as part of PUD approval.
(5) Provision shall be made for the preservation of open space. Preserved open space shall be dedicated, either in fee or through a conservation easement to the Town, a community association comprising all of the present and future owners of lots or dwellings in the project, or a non-profit land conservation organization. The Development Review Board shall approve such easement. Preserved open space may remain in single ownership, subject to easement conditions and appropriate land management (e.g., forestry, agriculture). Land held in common shall be subject to appropriate deed restrictions stipulating the permitted and restricted use of such lot, and establishing the person or entity responsible for maintenance and long term stewardship. The Board shall approve the location, size and shape of lands set aside to be preserved for open space in accordance with the following:
a. Open space land shall provide for the protection of identified resources, including farmland, productive forest, wildlife habitat, natural areas, aquifer protection areas, surface waters, stream banks, historic and archaeological sites, and scenic views and vistas;
b. Designated open space may include the portion of a single lot which is characterized by one or more of the above referenced features, or may encompass the contiguous boundaries of the above referenced feature located on multiple lots;
c. The location, shape, size and character of the open space shall be suitable for its intended use. Generally, open space shall be at least 50% of the total area for projects involving a parcel(s) of twenty-five (25) acres or more. For smaller parcels, open space should be in proportion to the size and scope of the project, and its intended use;
d. Open space shall be suitably improved and/or maintained for its intended use, except for open space containing natural or cultural resources worthy of preservation that may be required to be left unimproved. Provisions shall be made to enable lands designated for agriculture and forestry to be used for these purposes. The Board as appropriate may require management plans for forests and/or wildlife habitat;
e. Open space land shall be located so as to conform with and extend existing and potential open space lands on adjacent parcels; and
f. Sewage disposal areas and utility and road rights-of-way or easements, access and parking areas shall not be counted as open space areas, except where the applicant can prove, to the satisfaction of the Board, that they will in no way disrupt or detract from the values for which the open space is to be protected.
(6) The total number of dwelling units shall not exceed that which would be permitted in the Development Review Board’s judgement if the parcel were subdivided into buildable lots in conformance with the district minimum lot area required for single family dwellings. However, the number of dwelling units allowed in a PUD may, at the discretion of the
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 64
Development Review Board, be increased in accordance with the following:
a. The Board may grant a density increase of up to 25% of the allowable number of units in instances in which a significant portion (50% or greater) of the site is preserved as open space and/or the Board determines that the PUD reflects an exceptional site design that will result in the preservation of important natural resources and the creation such amenities as pedestrian paths, parkland and/or playgrounds; or
b. The Board may grant a density increase of up to 50% of the allowable number of units in instances in which not less than 50% of the total number of dwelling units created are affordable housing units, as defined in Article 8.
(7) Where a district boundary line divides a parcel, the Development Review Board may allow the development of a single PUD with a total density based on the combined allowable density of each district.
(8) Two (2) or more contiguous parcels under the ownership or control of the applicant may be combined for review as a PUD. The permitted density on one parcel may be increased as long as the overall density for the combined parcels does not exceed that which could be permitted, in the Development Review Board’s judgement, if the land were subdivided into lots in conformance with district regulations.
(9) A PUD shall include only residential uses and associated accessory structures and uses allowed within the district in which the PUD is located. The dwelling units permitted may, at the discretion of the Development Review Board, be of varied types, including single-family, two-family, or multi-family construction, and may be attached or detached.
(E) District Standards. Within the Rural Residential and Forest Reserve Districts, dwellings may be comprised of one or more state licensed residential care home serving not more than 6 persons who are developmentally disabled or handicapped, and such dwellings may be clustered so that they are located within 1,000 feet of each other in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section and the approval of the Development Review Board under Section 5.2.
Section 5.5 Local Act 250 Review
(A) Applicability. In according with 24 V.S.A. §4420, the Development Review Board is hereby authorized to undertake local Act 250 review of municipal impacts of all Act 250 permits in the Town of Hardwick unless ALL of the following conditions apply:
(1) The applicant can establish to the satisfaction of the Development Review Board that the applicant relied on a determination by the Natural Resource’s Board local district coordinator that Act 250 jurisdiction did not apply to the development in question and, based on that reliance, the applicant obtained local permits without complying with the requirement for local Act 250 review.
(2) The Natural Resource Board’s local district coordinator’s jurisdictional ruling was later reconsidered or overturned on appeal, with the result that Act 250 jurisdiction does apply to development in question.
(3) The Development Review Board waives its local Act 250 review jurisdiction in the interest of fairness to the applicant. Determination by the Development Review
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 65
Board to waive local Act 250 review jurisdiction shall not be subject to review.
(B) MAPA. The Development Review Board shall hear applications for local Act 250 review of municipal impacts at a public hearing warned in accordance with Section 7.6(C) and pursuant to the procedures established under 24 V.S.A. Chapter 36 (the Municipal Administrative Procedures Act).
(C) Review Criteria. At the Development Review Board’s local Act 250 hearing, the applicant shall provide, at the minimum, all of the information related to Act 250 Criteria 6, 7, and 10, and shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the DRV that the proposed development:
(1) will not cause an unreasonable burden on the ability of the Town of Hardwick to provide educational services (criterion 6);
(2) will not cause an unreasonable burden on the ability of the Town of Hardwick to provide municipal or governmental services (criterion 7); and
(3) is in conformance with the duly adopted Town Plan (criterion 10).
Section 5.6 Review Procedures
At the time an application is deemed complete, the Development Review Board shall schedule a public hearing, warned in accordance with Section 7.6(C). The Board may recess the hearing (adjourn to a time and date) as needed to allow for the submission of testimony and evidence by the applicant or other interested parties. The Board shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application within 45 days of the date of adjournment of the final public hearing. The written decision shall include findings, any conditions of approval or reasons for denial, and provisions for appeal to the Environmental Court. The failure of the Board to act within this 45 day period shall be deemed and shall be effective on the 46th day.
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 66
ARTICLE 6. SUBDIVISION REVIEW
Section 6.1 Applicability
(A) Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, subdivision review and approval is required prior to:
? conveying or leasing of a subdivided parcel,
? grading, clearing, construction or installation of subdivision site improvements,
? applying for a zoning permit for the development of any subdivided parcel, or
? filing a subdivision plat in the land records of the town.
Such approval shall be granted by the Zoning Administrator or Development Review Board in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth below.
(B) Exemptions. The following are specifically exempted from subdivision review under this article:
(1) parcels leased for agricultural or forestry purposes where no permanent roads or structures are established,
(2) rights-of-way or easements which do not result in the subdivision of land, and
(3) boundary adjustments between existing parcels which do not create new or nonconforming lots.
(C) Minor & Major Subdivisions. For the purposes of these regulations, subdivisions of land are defined as “minor” or “major” subdivisions, as follows:
(1) Minor subdivisions, to be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator under Section 6.2 include:
a. the subdivision of land, or the resubdivision of a previously subdivided parcel, which results in the creation of a total of three or fewer lots within any five year period, regardless of any change in ownership; or
b. an amendment to an approved subdivision which does not substantially alter the subdivision, nor result in the creation of a major subdivision.
(2) Major subdivisions, to be reviewed by the Development Review Board under Section 6.3 include:
a. the subdivision of land, or the resubdivision of a previously subdivided parcel (e.g., a minor subdivision) which results in the creation of a total of four or more lots within any five year period and/or involves the construction of a new road;
b. an amendment to an approved subdivision which substantially alters the subdivision or conditions of approval, or which results in the creation of a major subdivision or a new road;
c. a planned unit development; and
Subdivision of Land: The division of any parcel of land into two or more parcels for the purpose of sale, transfer, lease or development. The term includes the resubdivision of a previously subdivided parcel, and the development of a parcel as a planned residential development.
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 67
d. the creation of a lot which does not meet minimum frontage or access requirements, which is subject to approval under Section 3.3.
(D) Coordination with Planned Unit Development Review. Applications for planned unit developments (PRDs) shall be reviewed concurrently by the Development Review Board as major subdivisions in accordance with Section 6.3 and associated PUD requirements under Article 5.4.
Section 6.2 Minor Subdivision Review
(A) Zoning Permit Requirement. A zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with Section 7.1 is required for all minor subdivisions. The zoning permit issued for a minor subdivision under these regulations shall be separate from the zoning permit issued for the subsequent development of a subdivided parcel, and shall be identified as such; however zoning permits may be issued by the Zoning Administrator concurrently for the minor subdivision of land, and for the subsequent development of a subdivided parcel. Development Review Board
(B) Review Criteria. The zoning permit application for a minor subdivision shall include information required for sketch plans, as specified in Table 6.1. The Zoning Administrator shall review the sketch plan to determine whether all proposed lots, including any retained lot, comply with applicable lot size, setback, and access requirements under these regulations.

Section 6.3 Major Subdivision Review
(A) Subdivision Approval Requirement. The Development Review Board shall review all major subdivisions. Subdivision approval, rather than a zoning permit, shall be required for a major subdivision. An application for subdivision approval shall be made on forms provided by the Board and filed with the Development Review Board Secretary.
(B) Waiver Authority. Pursuant to the Act [§4418] the Development Review Board may waive application requirements as specified in Table 6.1, or subdivision standards under Sections 6.5, 6.6 and/or 6.7 which, in its judgment:
(1) are not requisite in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare;
(2) are inappropriate due to the inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent to or in proximity to the subdivision; or
(3) would unnecessarily add to the cost of an affordable housing development as defined in Article 8.2.
The request for a waiver shall be submitted in writing by the applicant with the subdivision application. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient information to justify the waiver or variance, and enable the Development Review Board to reach a decision. In granting waivers, the Board may require such conditions that will, in its judgment, substantially meet the objectives of the requirements so waived or varied. No such waiver may be granted if it would have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations or other municipal ordinances or regulations currently in effect.
(C) Sketch Plan Review. Prior to the submission of an application for major subdivision review, the applicant may submit a sketch plan to the Development Review Board
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 70
Secretary for consideration by the Board at a regularly scheduled Board meeting. Sketch plan review is strongly recommended for all planned unit developments.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of sketch plan review is to acquaint the Development Review Board with the proposed subdivision at an early stage in the design process, prior to the applicant incurring significant expense. Sketch plan review is intended to allow for an informal exchange of ideas, in which the applicant explores with the Board subdivision design options that best meet the needs of the applicant and the requirements of these regulations.
(2) Submission Requirements. One original and seven copies of the sketch plan, to include information specified in Table 6.1, should be submitted to the Development Review Board at least 15 days prior to a regularly scheduled commission meeting.
(3) Effect. The Development Review Board may offer comments and recommendations at the meeting or, within 30 days of the date of the meeting, provide comments and recommendations to the applicant in writing. Such comments are advisory and as such shall not constitute an appealable decision or action of the Development Review Board, and shall not be binding on subsequent subdivision review.
(D) Subdivision Review [Required]. The application for major subdivision review shall include one original and seven copies of the information for subdivision plan approval specified in Table 6.1, and any required fees. The application must also include, in writing, any requested waivers to be considered under Subsection (B) and the reasons for such waivers. The Development Review Board shall consider the application in accordance with the following:
(1) Public Hearing. As required by the Act [§4463] within 45 days of the date submission of a complete application for major subdivision approval, the Development Review Board shall hold a public hearing on the application, warned in accordance with Section 7.6. In the event that the subdivision is located within 500 feet of a municipal boundary, copies of the hearing notice also shall be sent, at least 15 days prior to the hearing date, to the clerk of an adjacent municipality. After the hearing is convened the Development Review Board may continue the hearing as needed to request and allow for the submission of additional information or studies to determine conformance with these regulations.
(2) Final Approval. As required by the Act [§4463], within 45 days of the date of adjournment of the public hearing, the Development Review Board shall approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the subdivision plan and associated plat, based on a determination of the subdivision’s conformance with review standards under Sections 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7.
(3) Performance Bonding. For any subdivision that includes the construction of roads or other physical improvements, the Development Review Board may require the subdivider to post a performance bond or other comparable surety to ensure completion of the improvements in accordance with approved specifications. In accordance with the Act [§4464(b)(6)], the term of a performance bond shall be fixed by the Development Review Board for a period not to exceed three years, unless with the consent of the owner it is extended for an additional period not to exceed three years. If any required improvements have not been installed or
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 71
maintained as provided, the bond shall be forfeited to the municipality which shall then use the proceeds to install and maintain covered improvements.
(4) Effect. Approval of the Development Review Board of a major subdivision shall not be construed to constitute acceptance by the town of any street, easement, utility, park, recreation area or other open space shown on the final plat. Such acceptance may be accomplished only by an act of the Hardwick Selectboard, in accordance with state law for the laying out of public rights-of-way.
(E) Recording & Amendment Requirements.
(1) In accordance with the Act [§4463], within 180 days of the date of receipt of final subdivision approval under Subsection (D)(2), the subdivider shall file three copies of plan and final plat (one Mylar, two paper), signed by an authorized representative of the Development Review Board, for recording in the land records of the town in conformance with the requirements of 27 V.S.A. Chapter 17. Approval of subdivision plats not filed within 180 days shall expire.
(2) Notwithstanding (1) above, the Zoning Administrator may extend the deadline for filing the plat by 90 days, if the subdivider can demonstrate that final local or state permits or approvals are still pending.
(3) The municipality shall meet all recording requirements for subdivision approvals as specified for municipal land use permits under Section 7.6.
(4) No changes, modifications, or other revisions that alter the final plat or the conditions attached to subdivision approval shall be made unless the proposed revisions are first submitted for review by the Zoning Administrator under Section 6.2 as a minor subdivision amendment, or the Development Review Board under 6.3 as major subdivision amendment. In the event that revisions are recorded without complying with this requirement, the revisions shall constitute a violation of these regulations, and be considered null and void.
Section 6.4 Application of Subdivision Standards
(A) The Development Review Board shall evaluate major subdivisions under the standards set forth in this article. The Development Review Board, to assist in its evaluation, may require:
(1) that the subdivider identify the intended use of land to be subdivided, including a general indication of subsequent development plans for retained land when only a portion of an existing parcel is to be subdivided;
(2) an independent technical review of the proposed subdivision under one or more standards, prepared by a qualified professional and paid for by the subdivider; and
(3) the modification of the subdivision design, the phasing of development, and/or additional measures to avoid or mitigate any adverse impacts likely to result from the proposed subdivision.
Section 6.5 General Standards [applicable to all Major Subdivision]
(A) Development Suitability. All land to be subdivided shall be suitable for the intended use and proposed density of development, and not result in undue adverse impacts to public health and safety, natural resources identified in the Hardwick Town Plan, or the character of the surrounding neighborhood in which it is located. Subdivisions shall set
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 72
aside, or exclude from subsequent development, land that is characterized by periodic flooding, poor drainage, steep slopes, or other hazardous conditions, or that is inadequate to support structures or infrastructure.
(B) Hardwick Town Plan & Regulations. Subdivisions shall conform to the Hardwick Town Plan, other provisions of these regulations, capital budget and programs, and all other municipal bylaws, ordinances and regulations in effect at the time of application.
(C) District Settlement Patterns. A subdivision shall be designed to achieve the purpose, objectives and desired settlement patterns of the zoning district(s) in which it is located, as defined in Article 2. To the extent feasible, new subdivisions of land shall:
(1) maintain and extend desired settlement patterns, including lot areas and configurations, building locations, and road networks;
(2) maintain contiguous tracts of open land with adjoining parcels; and
(3) connect and extend existing road, sidewalk, path, and utility corridors.
(D) Lot Layout. Lot layouts shall:
(1) be consistent with the suitability of land for development, as defined under Subsection (A);
(2) conform to desired district settlement patterns, as required under Subsection (C);
(3) meet zoning district minimum lot size and density requirements under Article 2, except as modified for planned unit developments under Article 5.4;
(4) conform to lot and yard requirements under Section 3.8; and
(5) avoid irregularly shaped lots (e.g., with curves, jogs, dog-legs, etc.), unless warranted due to topographic constraints, or to minimize the fragmentation of natural, scenic or cultural features.
(E) Survey Monuments. The locations of all proposed permanent surveying monuments and corner markers, as required under the Rules of the Board of Land Surveyors, shall be identified on the final subdivision plat.
(F) Building Envelopes. The Development Review Board may require the designation of building envelopes to limit the location of structures, parking areas, and associated site improvements to one or more portions of a lot. The size and shape of each building envelope shall be established in accordance with these regulations. The Development Review Board also may require the identification of specific building footprints if, in its judgment, such information is needed to determine conformance with these regulations.
(G) Natural, Scenic & Historic Resource Protection. Subdivision boundaries, lot lines, and building envelopes shall be located and configured to avoid adverse impacts to significant natural, historic and scenic features identified in the Hardwick Town Plan or through site investigation. For purposes of these regulations, these shall include wetlands, surface waters, and associated buffer areas (Section 3.12); flood hazard areas (Section 5.3); prominent ridgelines and hilltops, rock outcroppings, and slopes in excess of 25% (Section 3.15); critical wildlife habitat areas; and historic sites, structures and features (e.g., buildings, cellar holes, stone walls). Accordingly:
(1) lot lines shall be configured to avoid the fragmentation of significant natural or
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 73
cultural features, including designated buffer areas;
(2) building envelopes shall be located and sized to exclude such features;
(3) roads, driveways and utility corridors, to the extent feasible, shall be shared, located to follow existing linear features (e.g., farm roads, stone walls, tree and fence lines), and to avoid significant natural and cultural features;
(4) lot lines and building envelopes shall be located to ensure that no buildings are placed on steep slopes, or extend above the height of land (highest point) of any prominent ridgeline or hilltop;
(5) historic sites and structures shall be incorporated in subdivision design and layout;
(6) subdividers may be required to incorporate buffers, landscaping or screening in subdivision design, and/or submit management plans to protect significant natural, scenic and historic resources.
(H) Stormwater Management & Erosion Control. Subdivisions shall incorporate temporary and permanent stormwater management and erosion control practices appropriate for the type and density of proposed development. Accordingly:
(1) All stormwater management systems shall be designed to:
a. use natural drainage systems to the extent feasible, and minimize the need for maintenance,
b. maximize on-site infiltration and treatment of stormwater, and minimize surface runoff,
c. accommodate anticipated storm events,
d. provide storage areas and treatment to manage flow and protect water quality, and
e. avoid damage to adjoining or downstream properties.
(2) The Development Review Board may require the submission of stormwater management and erosion control plans, prepared by a licensed professional. Such plans shall incorporate acceptable stormwater treatment practices and sizing criteria set forth in the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual as most recently amended.
(3) The Development Review Board may require the phasing of site development or construction to limit the extent of disturbed area during each phase of the subdivision.
(4) The Development Review Board also may require an evaluation of the effect of the subdivision on existing downstream drainage capacity outside the area of subdivision. Where the Board finds that increased runoff from the subdivision will exceed the capacity of downstream storage, drainage or treatment systems, it may request that the subdivider delay construction until such capacity exists, or to install necessary off-site improvements as needed to increase capacity.
(I) Landscaping & Screening. The preservation, planting and maintenance of trees, ground cover, or other vegetation, of a size and type deemed appropriate by the Development Review Board, may be required to:
(1) preserve existing trees, tree lines, wooded areas of particular natural or aesthetic
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 74
value to the site, or critical wildlife habitat areas;
(2) provide an undisturbed vegetated buffer between developed and undeveloped portions of the site to protect water quality, or other natural or scenic features.
(3) provide screening to increase privacy, reduce noise or glare, or establish a barrier between incompatible land uses; and/or to
(4) establish a tree canopy along roads or pedestrian walkways where the Development Review Board deems it appropriate.
(J) Energy Conservation. Subdivision design and layout, to the extent feasible, will encourage energy efficiency through:
(1) the siting and orientation of development (e.g., building envelopes), to take advantage of southern exposures and natural vegetative or topographic buffers;
(2) the clustering of development (e.g., lots, building envelopes) to minimize road and utility line extensions and reduce travel distances; and
(3) the effective use of landscaping to provide wind barriers and shading, and to reduce heat loss.
Section 6.6 Transportation Facilities & Infrastructure
(A) Access. Access to the subdivision and to individual lots shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.3. All access onto town highways shall be subject to the approval of the Hardwick Selectboard, or for state routes, the Vermont Agency of Transportation. Such approval shall be required prior to final subdivision plan approval. To better manage traffic flow and safety, to avoid congestion, and to preserve the capacity of local roads, the Development Review Board may also:
(1) limit the number of access points onto public highways;
(2) require shared access, driveways, and/or roads to serve multiple lots;
(3) require access from secondary roads, if a proposed subdivision has frontage on both primary and secondary roads;
(4) require rights-of-way for future road extensions to connect to adjoining parcels; and/or
(5) prohibit the creation of reserved strips adjacent to a proposed road which would deny access from adjacent properties.
(B) Driveways. Driveways serving three or fewer lots, shall meet standards for driveways included in the Town of Hardwick Policy for Transportation Construction and Improvements as most recently amended. For the purposes of these regulations, driveways serving four or more lots shall be considered roads subject to the requirements of Subsection (C).
(C) Roads. The following road standards shall apply to all public roads, and to private roads serving four or more lots.
(1) Capacity. Traffic to be generated by the proposed subdivision shall not result in unreasonable traffic congestion on public highways, or exceed the functional capacity of roads, intersections and related infrastructure in the vicinity of the subdivision. The Development Review Board may require the submission of a
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 75
traffic impact study to identify impacts and necessary mitigation measures to ensure road safety and efficiency, the cost of which shall be borne by the applicant. The subdivider, as a condition of approval, also may be required to install needed traffic control measures and road improvements, and/or reserve land to accommodate future improvements, as needed to serve the subdivision.
(2) Layout. Roads shall be laid out to:
a. minimize the amount of cut and fill required,
b. maintain reasonable grades and safe intersections,
c. produce useable lots,
d. allow for access by emergency vehicles,
e. avoid adverse impacts to natural, scenic and historic features,
f. follow existing linear features (e.g., field edges, utility corridors, tree and fence lines, stone walls),
g. avoid dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs, particularly in village areas, and
h. allow for future road extensions, identified as proposed easements on the subdivision plat, to serve adjoining parcels.
(3) Design & Construction. All roads serving the proposed subdivision shall be designed according to the dimensional and geometric design standards for streets and roads contained in the Vermont State Standards for the Design of Transportation Construction, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation on Freeways, Roads, and Streets as most recently amended; and constructed in accordance with the Town of Hardwick Policy for Transportation Construction and Improvements.
(4) Maintenance. The maintenance of all roads not designated as Class III town highways or higher shall be the responsibility of the subdivider and subsequent property owners. The subdivider shall provide evidence and assurance that such roads will be adequately maintained by the subdivider and/or an owners’ association. In instances involving proposed lots requiring access onto Class IV town highways, a road maintenance agreement approved by the Hardwick Selectboard shall be required prior to final subdivision approval.
(5) Names & Signs. Road names shall be approved by the Hardwick Selectboard, in accordance with road naming ordinances and policies currently in effect. Approved road names shall be clearly depicted on the final plat, and identified on signs approved by the Selectboard.
(E) Parking Facilities. Common or shared parking areas shall be identified on the subdivision plat, and designed in accordance with Section 3.10. Parking areas for individual lots shall be included within designated building envelopes.
(F) Transit Facilities. The Development Review Board may require that subdivisions located on existing or proposed transit routes, including school bus routes, include a sheltered transit stop for use by residents of the subdivision.
(G) Pedestrian Access. To facilitate pedestrian access from the subdivision to adjoining parcels and roads, or to nearby public schools, playgrounds, or public lands, the
Hardwick Unified Development Bylaws: Amended 9-26-19 Page 76
Development Review Board may require one or more of the following:
(1) sidewalks and curbing to connect to existing sidewalks on adjoining properties;
(2) sidewalks and curbing along internal subdivision roads within the Central Business and Village Neighborhood Districts.
(3) the installation of pedestrian crosswalks at designated intersections,
(4) unobstructed easements at least 10 feet in width for pedestrian or recreation paths, as indicated on the final plat.
Section 6.7 Facilities & Utilities
(A) Public Facilities. The Development Review Board shall find that the proposed subdivision does not create an undue burden on existing and planned public facilities. The Development Review Board may consult with appropriate municipal and school officials to determine whether adequate capacity exists to serve the subdivision. The Development Review Board also may require a fiscal impact analysis, to be paid for by the subdivider, and/or the phasing of development in accordance with a duly adopted municipal or school capital budget and program.
(B) Fire Protection. The Development Review Board, in consultation with the Hardwick Fire Department, may require that the subdivder provide adequate water storage and distribution facilities for fire protection. The subdivider shall install fire hydrants, dry hydrants, or fire ponds as required by the Board.

(1) that there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning regulation in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
(2) that because of such physical circumstances and conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning regulation and that the authorization of a variance is necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
(3) that the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
(4) that the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
(5) that the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the zoning regulation and from the plan.
(B) (B) In granting a variance, the Development Review Board may impose conditions it deems necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the purposes of these bylaws and the municipal plan currently in effect. In no case shall the Development

Review Board grant a variance for a use which is not permitted or conditionally permitted within the zoning district, or which results in an increase in allowable density.
(C) Variances within the Flood Hazard Area Overlay District shall be granted by the Development Review Board only:
(1) in accordance with the Act [§4469, §4424] and in accordance with the criteria for granting variances found in 44 CFR, Section 60.6, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations;
(2) upon a determination that during the base flood discharge the variance will not result in increased flood levels; and
(3) upon a determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(4) Any variance issued in the Special Flood Hazard Area will inform the applicant in writing over the signature of the Zoning Administrator that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation increases risk to life and property and will result in increased flood insurance premiums up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of coverage.

The term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: a) Any project for improvement of a structure to address violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or b) Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”
