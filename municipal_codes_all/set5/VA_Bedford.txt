PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Bedford, Virginia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code, as supplemented through July 22, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Code Attorney, and Beth Singletary, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to William Berry, Town Attorney, and Teresa Hatcher, Clerk of the Council, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Sec. 13. - Forfeiture of office upon conviction of felony.

At the same meeting council shall elect a mayor and vice mayor. Thereafter the council shall meet regularly at such time as may be prescribed by ordinance or resolution, such regular meetings to be not less than once each month. 
(Acts 1969, ch. 6, § 1)

He shall receive such compensation as clerk to the council as may be determined by the council. 
(Acts 1969, ch. 6, § 1) 
Editor's note "Clerk to the council" is as enacted by the general assembly. See, however, sections 8, 10, 18 and others of this Charter, in which the assembly uses "clerk of the council"; and such officer is referred to as "clerk of the council" in the Town Code. 
State Law reference Adoption of ordinances and resolutions, Code of Virginia, § 15.2-1427. 
Enactments

(Acts 1969, ch. 6, § 1)  
Sec. 20. - Final passage of ordinance on day of presentation and first reading.

(1)  Any law-enforcement officer may have an unattended or immobile vehicle removed or have it removed to a storage area for safekeeping and shall report the removal to the department of motor vehicles and to the owner of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination as promptly as possible. Before obtaining possession of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination, its owner shall pay to the parties entitled thereto all costs incidental to its removal or storage. In any violation of this section the owner of such motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or part or combination of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, shall be presumed to be the person committing the violation; however, this presumption shall be rebuttable by competent evidence. Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part or combination of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer was stolen or illegally used by a person other than the owner without his authorization, express or implied, it shall be forthwith returned to its owner who shall be relieved of the payment of any costs. In any case in which the identity of the violator cannot be determined, or where it is found by a court that this section was not violated, the costs of the removal and storage of the vehicle shall be paid out of the state treasury from the appropriation for criminal charges. If any person convicted of violating this section fails or refuses to pay these costs or if the identity or whereabouts of the owner is unknown and unascertainable after a diligent search has been made or after notice to the owner at his address as indicated by the records of the department of motor vehicles and to the holder of any lien of record with the department of motor vehicles, against the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination, the commissioner of the department of motor vehicles may, after 30 days and after having the value of such motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination determined by three disinterested dealers dispose of it by public or private sale. The proceeds from the sale shall be forthwith paid by him into the state treasury and shall be set aside as a special fund to be used to meet the expenses of the department of motor vehicles in carrying out the duties required by this section and to reimburse the owner of such motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination as hereafter provided in this section. 
(2)  If after the sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination the ownership of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer at the time of its removal is established satisfactorily to the commissioner of the department of motor vehicles by the person claiming its ownership, the commissioner of the department of motor vehicles shall pay him so much of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination as remains after paying the costs of removal, storage, investigation of ownership, appraisal, and sale. 
(c)  Removal of vehicles blocking rights-of-way. Whenever any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer interferes with the free ingress, egress, or movement on any premises, driveway, or parking area, without the permission of the owner of that property, any law-enforcement officer may remove it or have it removed to a storage area for safekeeping and shall report the removal to the department and to the owner of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or other vehicle as promptly as possible. Before obtaining the possession of his property, the owner shall pay to the parties entitled thereto all costs incidental to its removal or storage. 
(d)  Accident vehicles in rights-of-way. Whenever a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer involved in an accident is so located as to impede the orderly flow of traffic, the police may:

(2)  Have the vehicle removed to a storage area for safekeeping and shall report the removal to the department of motor vehicles and to the owner of the vehicle as promptly as possible. 
If the vehicle is removed to a storage area under subsection (d)(2) of this section, the owner shall pay to the parties entitled thereto all costs incidental to its removal and storage.

(2)  The public works department, the police department, department of emergency management, and other local public safety agencies and their officers, employees and agents, shall not be held responsible for any damages or claims that may result from the failure to exercise any authority granted under this section provided they are acting in good faith. 
(3)  The owner and carrier, if any, of the vehicle, cargo or personal property removed or disposed of under the authority of this section shall reimburse the department of transportation, the police department, department of emergency management, and local public safety agencies for all costs incurred in the removal and subsequent disposition of such property. 
(f)  Storage of vehicles on private property without consent of owner. 
(1)  No person shall leave any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer on the private property of any other person without his consent.

Owners of private property which is normally open to the public for parking are required to post or cause to be posted signs warning that vehicles left on the property for more than 72 hours will be towed or removed at their owners' expense. Person at whose request the vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part thereof is so removed shall indemnify the county, city, or town against any loss or expense incurred by reason of removal, storage, or sale thereof. 
(2)  In the case of the removal of a motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer from private property, when it cannot be readily sold, the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part may be disposed of in whatever manner the governing body of the county, city, or town may provide. 
(3)  In all other respects, the provisions of Code of Virginia, §§ 46.2-1213 and 46.2-1217 shall apply to these removals. Disposal of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer may at the option of the governing body of the county, city, or town be carried out under either the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 46.2-1213, after notice to him at his last known address and to the holder of any lien of record in the office of the department against the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, and after the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer has been held at least 60 days.

There shall be no requirement regarding the length of time an applicant has been a resident or domiciliary of the county or city. The application shall be made under oath before a notary or other person qualified to take oaths and shall be made only on a form prescribed by the department of state police, in consultation with the supreme court, requiring only that information necessary to determine eligibility for the permit. The clerk shall enter on the application the date on which the application and all other information required to be submitted by the applicant is received. The court shall consult with either the sheriff or police department of the county or city and receive a report from the central criminal records exchange. As a condition for issuance of a concealed handgun permit, the applicant shall submit to fingerprinting if required by local ordinance in the county or city where the applicant resides and provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded with the fingerprints through the central criminal records exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding the applicant, and obtaining fingerprint identification information from federal records pursuant to criminal investigations by state and local law-enforcement agencies. Where feasible and practical, the police department may transfer information electronically to the state police instead of inked fingerprint cards. Upon completion of the criminal history records check, the state police shall return the fingerprint cards to the police department or, in the case of scanned fingerprints, destroy the electronic record. The police department shall then promptly notify the person that he has 21 days from the date of the notice to request return of the fingerprint cards, if any. All fingerprint cards not claimed by the applicant within 21 days of notification by the police department shall be destroyed. All optically scanned fingerprints shall be destroyed upon completion of the criminal history records check without requiring that the applicant be notified. Fingerprints taken for the purposes described in this section shall not be copied, held or used for any other purposes. The court shall issue the permit within 45 days of receipt of the completed application unless it is determined that the applicant is disqualified. Any order denying issuance of the permit shall state the basis for the denial of the permit and the applicant's right to and the requirements for perfecting an appeal of such order pursuant to subsection (l) of this section. An application is deemed complete when all information required to be furnished by the applicant is delivered to and received by the clerk of court before or concomitant with the conduct of a state or national criminal history records check. If the court has not issued the permit or determined that the applicant is disqualified within 45 days of the date of receipt noted on the application, the clerk shall certify on the application that the 45-day period has expired, and send a copy of the certified application to the applicant. The certified application shall serve as a de facto permit, which shall expire 90 days after issuance, and shall be recognized as a valid concealed handgun permit when presented with a valid government-issued photo identification pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, until the court issues a five-year permit or finds the applicant to be disqualified. If the applicant is found to be disqualified after the de facto permit is issued, the applicant shall surrender the de facto permit to the court and the disqualification shall be deemed a denial of the permit and a revocation of the de facto permit. If the applicant is later found by the court to be disqualified after a five-year permit has been issued, the permit shall be revoked. The clerk of court may withhold from public disclosure the social security number contained in a permit application in response to a request to inspect or copy any such permit application, except that such social security number shall not be withheld from any law-enforcement officer acting in the performance of his official duties.

(c)  Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, if a person has already qualified for an exemption under this article, and if the person can prove by clear and convincing evidence that after so qualifying the person's physical or mental health has deteriorated to the point that the only alternative to permanently residing in a hospital, nursing home, convalescent home or other facility for physical or mental care is to have a relative move in and provide care for the person, and if the relative does then move in for that purpose, then none of the relative's income shall be counted towards the income limit, provided the owner of the residence has not transferred assets in excess of $10,000.00 without adequate consideration within a three-year period prior to or after the relative moves into such residence. 
(d)  The net combined financial worth, including the present value of all equitable interests, as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, of the owners, and of the spouse of any owner, excluding the value of the dwelling and the land, not exceeding one acre, upon which it is situated shall not exceed $100,000.00.

(b)  If such person is under 65 years of age such form shall have attached thereto a certification by the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans or the Railroad Retirement Board, or if such person is not eligible for certification by any of these agencies, a sworn affidavit by two medical doctors who are either licensed to practice medicine in the commonwealth or are military officers on active duty who practice medicine with the United States Armed Forces, to the effect that the person is permanently and totally disabled, as defined in section 54-57; however, a certification pursuant to U.S.C. 423(d) by the Social Security Administration, so long as the person remains eligible for such social benefits, shall be deemed to satisfy such definition in section 54-57. The affidavit of at least one of the doctors shall be based upon a physical examination of the person by such doctor. The affidavit of one of the doctors may be based upon medical information contained in the records of the civil service commission which is relevant to the standards for determining permanent and total disability as defined in section 54-47.

(Ord. No. 13-23, § 1, 12-10-2013)

Whenever the tax imposed by this article is measured by gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within this jurisdiction. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed, or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1)  The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provision of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715. 
(2)  The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled. However, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality. 
(3)  The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed. 
(4)  The gross receipts from the performance of personal services shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled.

Sec. 54-335. - Apportionment. 
If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule (and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement) except as to circumstances set forth in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3709, the gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be attributed to this jurisdiction in the event the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction.

Sec. 54-336. - Agreements. 
The assessor may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision the state concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes on more than 100 percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved. If an agreement cannot be reached, either the assessor or taxpayer may seek an advisory opinion from the department of taxation pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3701; notice of the request shall be given to the other party. Notwithstanding the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3993, when a taxpayer has demonstrated to a court that two or more political subdivisions of the state have assessed taxes on gross receipts that may create a double assessment within the meaning of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3986, the court shall enter such orders pending resolution of the litigation as may be necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is not required to pay multiple assessments even though it is not then known which assessment is correct and which is erroneous.

Sec. 54-380. - Suspension of license.

(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this article, both the assessing official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3903, the assessing official shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six preceding license years. 
(c)  The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3940, two years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this subsection of the article, two years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 54-383(b) or (d), or two years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3940 or a similar law for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later.

State Law reference Similar provisions, Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3703.1A.  
Sec. 54-383. - Appeals and rulings. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of an appealable event as defined in this section may apply within one year from the last day of the tax year for which such assessment is made, or within one year from the date of the appealable event, whichever is later, to the assessor for a correction of the assessment. The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, the tax periods covered by the challenged assessments, the remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The assessor may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, an audit or further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the application. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The assessor shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an appealable event shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed in the jurisdiction (e.g., the name and address to which an application should be directed). 
(b)  Provided a timely and complete application is made, collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the assessor, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 54-33, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires to: (i) depart quickly from the locality, (ii) remove his property therefrom, (iii) conceal himself or his property therein, or (iv) do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
(c)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of a determination, upon an application for correction pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, that is adverse to the position asserted by the taxpayer in such application may apply within 90 days of the determination by the assessing official to the tax assessor for a correction of such assessment. The tax assessor shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1821, and the tax assessor may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1822. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the assessing official may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984. However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show that the ruling of the tax assessor is erroneous. Neither the tax assessor nor the department of taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax assessor has ruled on it. 
(d)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax assessor under subsection (c) of this section, the assessing official shall further suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued by the tax assessor, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 54-331, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(e)  Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of a local license tax to a specific situation from the assessor. Any person requesting such a ruling must provide all the relevant facts for the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or the factual situation as presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if there is a change in the law, a court decision, or the guidelines issued by the department of taxation upon which the ruling was based, or the assessor notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy or interpretation upon which the ruling was based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect. 
(f)  For purposes of this section, "appealable event" means an increase in the assessment of a local license tax payable by a taxpayer, the denial of a refund, or the assessment of a local license tax where none previously was assessed, arising out of the local assessing official's: (i) examination of records, financial statements, books of account or other information for the purpose of determining the correctness of an assessment, (ii) determination regarding the rate or classification applicable to the licensable business, (iii) assessment of a local license tax when no return has been filed by the taxpayer, or (iv) denial of an application for correction of erroneous assessment attendant to the filing of an amended application for license. 
(g)  Any taxpayer whose application for correction pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section has been pending for more than two years without the issuance of a final determination may, upon not less than 30 days' written notice to the assessor, elect to treat the application as denied and appeal the assessment to the tax assessor in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. The tax assessor shall not consider an appeal filed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection if he finds that the absence of final determination on the part of the assessor was caused by the willful failure or refusal of the taxpayer to provide information requested and reasonably needed by the assessor to make his determination.

The names of all officers, members, partners or associates participating in the gross receipts shall be reported on the application for license and listed on the license.

State Law reference Authority to establish due date, Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2119.  
Sec. 58-171. - Schedule P.C.A. (fixed average PCA). 
(a)  Applicability. The power cost adjustment (PCA) shall be applicable to and become part of each electric rate schedule in the tariff except Schedule O.L. 
(b)  Methodology. The PCA is an adjustment to each electric customer's monthly bill that is applied to the customer's individual kWh consumption in order to recover changing power costs when there have been increases in such costs and to reduce said charge when there have been decreases in power costs. Several conditions affect the cost of power including, but not limited to weather, demand, transmission costs, and contract stipulations. When there are increases in power costs, the PCA allows recovery of those costs. If the cost of power decreases, decreased costs are passed along to the customer as well. 
A six-month fixed average PCA formula set forth in this schedule is designed to provide customers with a stable rate structure which will be adjusted every six months in order to reflect changes in power costs. 
The six-month fixed PCA calculation is based on the following eight considerations. 
1.  Base the PCA on fixed six-month period of historical Bedford's billing data; 
2.  Automatically adjust twice per year in order to include heavy use months of June, July, and August in one six-month period and heavy use months of December, January, and February in another six-month data period; 
3.  Differentiate PCA charges by voltage level of service, 
4.  Allow for adjustments for known changes (such as the increase in transmission costs for this year); 
5.  Make a provision for an emergency adjustment for unforeseen cost events (storms, equipment failures, replacement power); 
6.  Provide for a "true-up" adjustment when the PCA revenue received in a six-month period does not match actual power cost for the period; 
7.  Provide council with a report which calculates the PCA prior to the automatic adjustments, so that the town council may decide not to implement all or part of any PCA increase; 
8.  Include a notice in bills to customers when the PCA changes. 
(c)  Calculation of PCA under formula. The amount charged for each kWh of energy sold by the town as set forth in the applicable schedules to this tariff shall be increased or decreased in accordance with the following PCA adjustment procedure: 
Step 1Identification of actual historical power costs (PC): 
The power source includes: 
(a)  The total AMP bill. 
(b)  Snowden operating costs. 
(c)  Holcomb Rock purchases. 
(d)  Diesel fuel purchases. 
(e)  Other power purchases (such as solar power). 
Step 2Adjustments: 
(a)  Deduct AMP administrative costs (found on AMP bill). 
(b)  Add or deduct known and measurable changes (anticipated in transmission rates or other material cost factors during the next six months). 
Step 3Deduct AMP related charges on AMP bill or other quantities applicable to certain customers billed under rate schedules not subject to the PCA. 
Step 4Identify actual sales from the "power reports" for the most recent six months. 
Step 5Calculate the total sales for the most recent six-month period and the total adjusted costs from the most recent six-month period. 
Step 6Calculate the six-month average power cost by dividing the total adjusted six-month costs by the total six-month sales. 
Step 7 
(a)  Compare the actual revenue recovered under the PCA for the last six months with the actual power costs during that six-month period; 
(b)  Calculate the difference in over or under recovery during the six-month period; 
(c)  True-up the over or under recovery by dividing the amount of over or under recovery by the anticipated sales for the next six months. This calculation is intended to recapture actual costs not recovered during the six-month period under the PCA by spreading such recovery over the next six months or by making corresponding reductions in the PCA over the next six months to spread out over recovery. 
Step 8Make emergency adjustments for unanticipated replacement power or other unforeseen conditions that may have a substantial impact upon power costs (storms, equipment failures, replacement power costs). Any emergency adjustments must be approved by town council. 
Step 9Add the six-month average power cost (from step 6) with the true-up value (from step 7) and any emergency adjustment (from step 8). Note that all values are expressed in $/kWh basis. 
Step 10Subtract the amount of power cost included in the base rates from the adjusted power cost calculated in step 9. 
Note: Loss adjustment is applied for customers taking service at primary voltages by multiplying the average PCA calculated in step 10 by .98. 
(d)  Application of PCA changes. The electric department shall recalculate the PCA at six-month intervals to become effective on November 1 and May 1 based upon actual data available from the most recent six-month period. The town shall provide all electrical customers a notice of PCA changes as part of monthly billings. 
(e)  Review by council. Calculations of proposed automatic PCA changes shall be reported to town council at its second meetings in April, at which time council shall review the proposed PCA for the next six months beginning on May 1, and at the second meeting in October for the next six months beginning November 1. The proposed PCA for the next six months shall take effect immediately on November 1 or May 1 unless the council at the second meeting in October or April determines otherwise. 
The town council retains at all times its authority to set electric rates, including changes to proposed automatic rates. The council at any time may make emergency adjustments for unanticipated replacement costs or other unforeseen conditions that may have a substantial impact upon power costs, subject to applicable requirements of law.

(3)  All sampling and analysis shall be performed as prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless applicable pretreatment standards specify otherwise. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain procedures for a particular pollutant, approved EPA sampling and analysis methods shall be used. The cost of sample collection and analysis shall be borne by the user sampled. 
(4)  Authorized representatives of the town or publicly owned treatment works, or authorized state or federal officials bearing proper credentials and identification shall be authorized to enter any premises of any industrial user in which a discharge source or treatment system is located or in which records are required to be kept under this article, to assure compliance with pretreatment standards and this article. Such authority shall be at least as extensive as the authority provided under the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1318). 
(5)  Authorized representatives of the town or publicly owned treatment works, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all private property through which the town holds an easement for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, reporting and applicable effluent test data copying, and maintenance of any of the town's treatment works lying within the easement. All entry and any subsequent work on the easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the easement pertaining to the private property involved. 
(6)  While performing any necessary work on private properties referred to above, the authorized representatives shall observe all safety and occupational rules established by the owner or occupant of the property and applicable to the premises. 
(7)  Within 30 days of approval the approval authority of the list of significant industrial users, under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), the publicly owned treatment works shall notify each significant industrial user of its status as such and of all the requirements applicable to it as a result of such status. 
(8)  Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the control authority, at a frequency specified by the control authority in the discharge permit, a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the control authority. These reports shall be based on the sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question or where the control authority determines that these sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using other applicable sampling and analytical methods or procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other persons, approved by the EPA. Categorical industrial users shall also submit periodic monitoring reports in accordance with the above requirements and in accordance with all federal, state and local discharge regulations. 
(9)  The industrial user shall notify the publicly owned treatment works, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the publicly owned treatment works of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste set forth in 40 CFR 261, the hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the publicly owned treatment works, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the waste, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place within 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e). 
(g)  Termination of services. The control authority reserves the right to immediately terminate water and wastewater disposal services and disconnect a customer from the system when any of the following conditions or circumstances exist: 
(1)  Acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment processes are released into the sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures or interfering with proper conveyance and treatment of wastewater. 
(2)  A governmental agency informs the control authority that the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant is no longer of a quality permitted for discharge into a watercourse, and it is found that the user is delivering wastewater to the control authority's system that cannot be sufficiently treated or requires treatment that is not provided by the control authority as normal domestic treatment. 
(3)  The user discharges industrial waste or wastewater that is in violation of the permit issued by the control authority and this article. 
(4)  The user discharges wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause an upset of the wastewater treatment system. 
(5)  The user fails to pay his bill for water and sanitary sewer services when due. 
(6)  The user violates prohibited discharge standards. 
If the user's service is disconnected pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the control authority shall supply the user with the governmental agency's report and other pertinent information. Service to the user shall not thereafter be provided until pretreatment facilities, approved by the control authority, are in satisfactory operation and the objections specified have been eliminated. 
(h)  Public access to records. All information pertaining to an industrial user discharge, industrial user permit, or to any source of discharge of any pollutant, shall be available to the public and authorized state and federal officials, unless the information has been identified by the submitter, at the time of submittal, as confidential. Effluent data cannot be claimed as confidential. All claims for confidential records must be made in accordance with 40 CFR 403.14, Confidentiality, of the Federal General Pretreatment Regulations.

The town manager may permit such a connection if there are legally binding commitments to provide the needed capacity. 
(Code 1984, § 19-15.1)  
Sec. 58-274. - Water conservation. 
The conservation of water shall be encouraged by the town manager. In establishing discharge limitations upon users, the town manager shall take into account already implemented or planned conservation steps revealed by the user. Upon request of the town manager, each user will provide the town with pertinent information showing that the quantities of substances or pollutants have not been and will not be increased as a result of the conservation steps. Upon such a showing to the satisfaction of the town manager, he shall make adjustments to discharge limitations, which have been based on concentrations to reflect the conservation steps. Any such adjustments by the town manager shall be in conformance with the federal and state pretreatment regulations. 
(Code 1984, § 19-15.2)

Sec. 58-277. - Right of entry of town officials. 
Authorized employees of the town bearing proper credentials and identification may enter upon all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1984, § 19-17)  
Sec. 58-278. - Strong sewages and wastewaters; industrial wastes; generally. 
(a)  The town will provide sewer service to users having strong sewage or wastewaters or any user which discharges any toxic pollutants, provided that the sewages or wastewaters are amenable to treatment and are not of a nature otherwise prohibited herein, all in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Wastes containing more than 240 mg/l of suspended solids or more than 240 mg/l of BOD, or other characteristics in concentrations not normally found in sanitary sewage, shall be considered strong sewages or wastewaters. 
(b)  As it is established that the town will provide sewer service to users as outlined in subsection (a) of this section, it is the intention of the town to also establish proportionate user charges that place the costs of treatment directly on such users. It is the purpose of these charges to maintain the financial self-sufficiency of the publicly owned treatment works by recovering the operation and maintenance expenses, including replacement, associated with the user's discharges. 
(c)  The proceeds of the user charges and strong waste surcharges will be used solely for the purpose of operating and maintaining the town's sewage works. 
(d)  It is also the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the town's sewage works for the implementation of the pretreatment program established herein. The town may adopt charges and fees which may include: 
(1)  Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the town's pretreatment program; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspections, and surveillance procedures; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for permit applications; 
(5)  Fees for filing appeals; 
(6)  Fees for consistent removal of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards; 
(7)  Other fees as the town may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
These fees relate solely to the matters covered by the pretreatment program and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the town. 
(e)  Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants (as defined in this chapter) which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the town's treatment works, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the appropriate financial personnel and approved by the approving authority. 
(Code 1984, § 19-18)  
Sec. 58-279. - Users having strong wastes or wastewaters connected to the sewer system. 
Owners of property served by more than one building sewer may, at their option, revise the building sewers to connect the sewer system through a single building sewer. One control manhole shall then be constructed, when required, on the single connection. 
(Code 1984, § 19-18.1)  
Sec. 58-280. - Industrial waste surcharge agreement. 
Users who discharge strong sewages or wastewaters, or any user which discharges any toxic pollutants shall be permitted by the control authority to enter into an industrial sewer connection agreement with the town providing for a surcharge over and above the normal sewer rate. The surcharge concentration range is included in the permit package. Surcharge shall never be in lieu of meeting federal, state or local pretreatment standards. The actual surcharge cost for operation and maintenance, including replacement, will be based upon the methodology presented on a schedule which is not contained in this Code, but will be found on file in the offices of the town clerk and the town manager. This surcharge is subject to change based on the actual cost to treat the wastewater. This surcharge will be reviewed annually in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 58-281. 
(Code 1984, § 19-18.2)  
Sec. 58-281. - User charges, strong waste surcharges, and pretreatment program fees. 
(a)  It is the purpose of user charges, strong waste surcharges, and pretreatment program fees established in accordance with this article to generate revenues for the operation of the town's wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment facility. It is further the purpose of these charges to collect these revenues from the users in proportion to the benefits that each user receives. 
(b)  In determining the annual expenses to operate and maintain the town's wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment facility, the town shall include, but not be limited to employee salaries, insurance, and fringe benefits; maintenance supplies; power and fuel; wastewater treatment chemicals; contracted professional engineering, laboratory, and legal services; facility and equipment replacement costs; debt service including principal, interest, and reserve; and facility and equipment repairs. To determine the annual revenue requirement, the town shall also consider facility improvements covered by debt financing. 
(c)  To allocate revenues for the operation and maintenance of the town's wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment facility, the town shall follow the general principles outlined below. 
(1)  The operation and maintenance expenses are primarily related to the volume and strength of the wastewater. These costs should be recovered from the current users of the system. Where all wastewater is the same strength (i.e., domestic wastewater), the costs shall be directly related to volume. Where the wastewater varies in strength (i.e., strong wastes), the difference in strength shall be considered when allocating costs. 
(2)  Annual expenses for the collection system are primarily related to volume. Therefore, that portion of the user charge for the collection system shall be based on volume, or flow rate. 
(3)  Annual expenses for the treatment facility are related to volume and wastewater strength, with wastewater strength based on BOD 5 , suspended solids, and in some cases, nitrogen. User charges and strong waste surcharges will incorporate these factors. 
(d)  The user charges will be based upon the methodology presented in a schedule which is not contained in this Code, but will be found on file in the offices of the town clerk and the town manager. The user charge will be reviewed annually in accordance with the procedures outlined in this section. 
(e)  All user charges, surcharges, and pretreatment program fees will be reviewed annually in conjunction with the establishment and approval of the town budget by the town council. It shall be the duty of the town manager or his designated representative to notify the users of changes in the rate structure for such user charges, surcharges, and pretreatment program fees. 
(f)  The purpose of this annual review is to ensure that adequate revenues are generated to pay for the costs of operation and maintenance, including replacement costs, and that the rate structure continues to provide for the proportional distribution of recoverable costs among the users. 
(Code 1984, § 19-18.3)  
Sec. 58-282. - Billing. 
(a)  The industrial waste surcharge and pretreatment program fees provided for in this article shall be included as separate items and paid monthly in accordance with other water and sewer fees and charges. Surcharges and pretreatment program fees shall be paid at the same time as the water and sewer charges of the person become due, and payment for water services shall not be accepted without payment also of the sewer service fees, industrial waste surcharges, and pretreatment program fees. 
(b)  Failure to pay monthly bills for water and/or sewer service, when due, or failure to pay the established sewer surcharge for industrial waste or pretreatment program fees when due, or repeated discharge of prohibited waste to the sanitary sewer, shall be sufficient cause to disconnect any and all services to the water and/or sanitary sewer mains of the town and the same penalties and charges now or hereafter provided for by the ordinances of the town, for failure to pay the bill for water and sewer service when due shall be applicable in like manner in cases of failure to pay the established surcharge for industrial waste discharged to the sanitary sewer mains or pretreatment program fees as established herein. 
(c)  Each user shall pay for the services provided by the town based on his use of the treatment works as determined by water meter readings (or other appropriate methods) acceptable to and approved by the town. 
(d)  For residential, industrial, institutional and commercial users, monthly user charges will be based on actual water usage. If a residential, commercial, institutional, or industrial user has a consumptive use of water, or, in some other manner, uses water which is not discharged into the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based on readings of wastewater meter installed and maintained at the user's expense. 
(e)  A late payment penalty of 1½ percent of the user charge bill will be added to each delinquent bill for each 30 days or portion thereof of delinquency. 
(f)  When any bill (including interest and penalty) remains unpaid for one year after the date due, such bill shall be recorded in the land records of the town by the treasurer and shall constitute a lien on the property. If such a lien (including interest and penalty) remains unpaid for a period of one year after date of recordation, such property shall be subject to public sale by the treasurer. 
(g)  Any user who feels his user charge is unjust and inequitable may make written application to the town manager requesting a review of his user charge. Said written request shall, where necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow and/or strength of his wastewater in comparison with the values upon which the charge is based, including how the measurements or estimates were made. 
(h)  Review of the request shall be made by the town manager and if substantiated, the user charges for that user shall be recomputed based on the revised flow and/or strength data and the new charges shall be applicable to the next billing period. 
(i)  The current sewer rate structure which is not contained in this Code, will be found on file in the offices of the town clerk and the town manager. The rate structure includes both residential and commercial rates, and rates for both inside and outside the town limits. Minimum fees based on the size of the water meter are also presented in this rate structure. This rate structure is subject to annual review and amendment in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 58-281.

(Code 1984, § 19-18.5)  
Sec. 58-284. - Program for sampling and analysis of wastewater. 
(a)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out as required by this article to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. 
(b)  Waste discharges of users having strong sewage or wastewaters shall be sampled by the town at least annually, or at some other frequency as the town may determine, for the length of time, as determined by the town, to be necessary to establish the characteristics of the wastewaters. 
(c)  The results of the analysis of the 24-hour composite samples shall be used to determine the concentrations of suspended solids or BOD for the computation of charges. 
(Code 1984, § 19-19)  
Sec. 58-285. - Industrial sewer application.

(e)  Random sampling and analysis. The publicly owned treatment works must randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. Publicly owned treatment works must inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year and must evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each such significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges. For purposes of this subsection, a slug discharge is any discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, including but not limited to, an accidental spill or a noncustomary batch discharge. The results of such activity shall be available to the approval authority upon request. If the publicly owned treatment works decides that a slug discharge control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the publicly owned treatment works of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for followup written notification within five days; 
(4)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency responses. 
(f)  Transfer of permits. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific significant industrial user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation, unless specifically approved by the control authority. 
(g)  Revocation of permits. Any significant industrial user who violates the conditions of his permit or of this article, or of applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked. Violations subjecting a user to possible revocation of his permit include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Failure of a user to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge. 
(2)  Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection.

Sec. 58-306. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purpose of this section: 
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which cause them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notice. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the town at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the town of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(d)  Bypass prohibited. 
(1)  If a bypass is prohibited, the town may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The town may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the town determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this subsection. 
(Code 1984, § 19-20)  
Sec. 58-307. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the town within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days. 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and time or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof, where allowed by law. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is lost, or fails.

The residential districts have been designed to provide for a variety of life styles, socio-economic needs and concentrations of development in accordance with the land use plan. The regulations for these districts are intended to protect the essential residential character of the districts; to this end, retail activity is sharply curtailed, and the districts are protected against encroachment of commercial or industrial uses and other uses likely to generate noise, crowds, large concentrations of traffic, light, dust, odors, smoke, and other obnoxious influences. The R-1E district is intended to provide for development of existing single family neighborhoods which prior to the adoption of town land development regulations were developed into lots that do not meet the minimum requirements of the R-1 and R-2 districts. 
(Ord. of 1-13-2001) 
601.02. Intent of Business Districts B-1 and B-2. The business districts have been designed to accommodate uses in a nodal development pattern. Provision is made for the conduct of general business to which the public requires direct and frequent access, but which is not characterized by either constant heavy trucking other than stocking and delivery of retail goods, or by any nuisance factors other than occasioned by incidental noise of congregation of people and passenger vehicles.

The primary purpose of this district is to preserve and protect lives and property in the floodplains of the town and to satisfy the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and the state water control board requirements for full entry into the National Flood Insurance Program, upon adoption of the Official Flood Hazard District Map from an engineering study. 
(Ord. of 5-28-1991) 
601.06. Intent of Planned Residential District PRD. This district is intended to accommodate development of planned residential communities in a manner that will protect and preserve the natural features of the land and provide for the greatest amount of usable open space, by permitting clustered patterns of development, allowing for a balanced mix of housing types, and encouraging efficient and innovative subdivision design concepts. 
601.07. Intent of Limited Professional District LP. The LP district is intended for low density residential uses and selected limited professional uses located in older or already existing buildings, and serving as a transitional zone between commercial and residential districts. 
601.08. Intent of Planned Memorial Park District PMPD. This district is intended to provide for the development of memorial parks which honor the memory and achievements of distinguished groups or individuals or significant events associated with them. It is also intended to provide for related memorial structures and activities. This district permits limited accessory uses to support convenient and effective public visitation of the memorial park site and provides for coordinated site development plans to assure protection of adjacent properties from the impacts of public access and development within the district. This zone is designed to allow flexibility in the planning and construction of the memorial park by allowing development in phases and by providing for administrative approval of minor modifications to the final master plan of development. 
601.09. Intent of Workplace Campus District WPC. The workplace campus district is intended to provide what is generally known as an industrial park for the location of environmentally clean light and medium manufacturing activities, warehousing, wholesale distribution, research and development, and office complexes.

(Ord. of 11-26-2002) 
601.10. Intent of Central Neighborhood Workplace District CNW. The central neighborhood workplace district is intended to allow for a mixture of uses within historic industrial buildings in the central area of the town. A full range of uses from residential to industrial are incorporated in order to preserve historic structures and enhance their viability as employment and commercial service centers in a way that does not compromise the integrity of adjacent neighborhoods. 
(Ord. of 11-26-2002) 
601.11. Intent of Traditional Neighborhood Overlay District TNO. The Traditional Neighborhood Overlay District, TNO is intended to promote the development of fully integrated mixed-use pedestrian oriented neighborhoods.

(Ord. No. 04-3, § 1, 2-24-2004) 
601.12. Intent of the Special Corridor Overlay District SCOD. The Special Corridor Overlay District, SCOD is intended to maintain the long-term mobility of arterial roadways (such as Routes 122, 221, and 460); to limit access and the number of conflicts (thereby reducing the need for additional crossover locations and traffic signals); to promote improved pedestrian and vehicular circulation; to encourage land assembly and the most desirable use of land in accordance with the comprehensive plan; to promote architectural continuity; to encourage designs which produce a desirable relationship between individual buildings, the circulation systems and adjacent areas; and to permit a flexible response of development to the market. The district shall apply only to specific areas as determined by town council. 
(Ord. No. 06-04, § 1(601.12), 2-28-2006)

Sec. 612. - Flood Hazard District FH. 
612.01. Statutory authorization and purpose. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to localities by Code of Virginia § 15.2-2280. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent: the loss of life and property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by: 
a.  Regulating uses, activities, and development which, alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and frequencies; 
b.  Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development from locating within districts subject to flooding; 
c.  Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur in flood-prone districts to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and flood damage; and, 
d.  Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards. 
612.02. Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all privately and publicly owned lands within the jurisdiction of the Town of Bedford and identified as being floodprone. 
612.03. Compliance and liability. 
a.  No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this ordinance and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this ordinance. 
b.  The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study, but does not imply total flood protection. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This ordinance does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
c.  Records of actions associated with administering this ordinance shall be kept on file and maintained by the planning department. 
d.  This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Bedford or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
612.04. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes any ordinance currently in effect in flood-prone districts. Any ordinance, however, shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that its provisions are more restrictive. 
612.05. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this ordinance shall be declared invalid for any reason whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this ordinance. The remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect; and for this purpose, the provisions of this ordinance are hereby declared to be severable. 
612.06. Penalty for violations. Any person who fails to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of this article or directions of the director of planning or any authorized employee of the Town of Bedford shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties therefore. 
In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this article shall not excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or noncompliances within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in noncompliance with this article may be declared by the Town of Bedford to be a public nuisance and abatable as such. Flood insurance may be withheld from structures constructed in violation of this article. 
612.07. Definitions. 
a.  Base flood. The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
b.  Base flood elevation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency designated 100-year water surface elevation.

f.  Elevated building. A non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers). 
g.  Encroachment. The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
h.  Flood or flooding. 
1.  A general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(a)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or, 
(b)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(c)  Mudflows which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph 1.(b) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
2.  The collapse or subsistence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph 1.(a) of this definition. 
i.  Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which the administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).

n.  Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization in the watershed. When a freeboard is included in the height of a structure, the flood insurance premiums may be cheaper. 
o.  Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
p.  Historic structure. Any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

s.  Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
t.  New construction. For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after June 28, 1974 or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
u.  Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis;

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
w.  Special flood hazard area. The land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year as determined in Article 3, Section 3.2 of this ordinance. 
x.  Start of construction. For other than new construction and substantial improvement, under the Coastal Barriers Resource Act (P.L. 97-348), means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of the construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

aa.  Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
2.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
bb.  Violation. the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
cc.  Watercourse. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
612.08. Description of floodplain zoning districts. 
a.  Basis of districts. The various floodplain districts shall include special flood hazard areas. The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for the Town of Bedford prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, dated April 2, 1992, and any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto. 
The boundaries of the special flood hazard area and floodplain districts are established as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map which is declared to be a part of this ordinance and which shall be kept on file at the planning department offices. 
1.  The Floodway District is delineated, for purposes of this ordinance, using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the 100-year flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. The areas included in this district are specifically defined in the above-referenced Flood Insurance Study and shown on the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
2.  The Special Floodplain District shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the maps accompanying the Flood Insurance Study for which 100-year flood elevations have been provided. 
3.  The Approximated Floodplain District shall be those areas identified as an A or A99 zone on the maps accompanying the Flood Insurance Study. In these zones, no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the 100-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. For these areas, the 100-year flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific 100-year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Flood Plain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the governing body. 
4.  The Shallow Flooding District shall be those areas identified as zone AO or AH on the maps accompanying the Flood Insurance Study. 
b.  Overlay concept. 
1.  The floodplain districts described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying districts as shown on the Official Zoning Ordinance Map, and as such, the provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. 
2.  If there is any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the floodplain districts and those of any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the floodplain districts shall apply. 
3.  In the event any provision concerning a floodplain district is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying provisions shall remain applicable. 
612.09. District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the Town of Bedford where natural or manmade changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for such change. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration. 
612.10. Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the zoning officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts, the board of zoning appeals shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
612.11. Submitting technical data. A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
612.12. Permit and application requirements. 
a.  Permit requirement. All uses, activities, and development occurring within any floodplain district, including placement of manufactured homes, shall be undertaken only upon the issuance of a zoning permit. Such development shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance and with all other applicable codes and ordinances, as amended, such as the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (VA USBC) and article XIII of the Land Development Regulations. Prior to the issuance of any such permit, the zoning administrator shall require all applications to include compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and shall review all sites to assure they are reasonably safe from flooding. Under no circumstances shall any use, activity, and/or development adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any watercourse, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system. 
b.  Site plans and permit applications. All applications for development within any floodplain district and all building permits issued for the floodplain shall incorporate the following information: 
1.  The elevation of the base flood at the site. 
2.  The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement). 
3.  For structures to be floodproofed (nonresidential only), the elevation to which the structure will be floodproofed. 
4.  Topographic information showing existing and proposed ground elevations. 
612.13. General standards. The following provisions shall apply to all permits: 
a.  New construction and substantial improvements shall be according to the VA USBC, and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
b.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
c.  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
d.  New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
e.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities, including duct work, shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
f.  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
g.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
h.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
In addition to provisions a.h. above, in all special flood hazard areas, the additional provisions shall apply: 
i.  Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any channels or of any watercourse, stream, etc., within this jurisdiction a permit shall be obtained from the U.S. Corps of Engineers, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (a joint permit application is available from any of these organizations). Furthermore, in riverine areas, notification of the proposal shall be given by the applicant to all affected adjacent jurisdictions, the Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
j.  The flood-carrying capacity within an altered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained. 
612.14. Specific standards. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevations have been provided in the Flood Insurance Study or generated according Article 4, section 4.6, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level. 
b.  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level. Buildings located in all A1-30, AE, and AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building components below the elevation corresponding to the BFE plus one foot are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification, including the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by (title of community administrator). 
c.  Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas, of new construction or substantially improved structures, which are below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall: 
1.  Not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
2.  Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection elevation; 
3.  include, in zones A, AO, AE, and A1-30, measures to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum design criteria: 
(a)  Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding. 
(b)  The total net area of all openings must be at least one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
(c)  If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit. 
(d)  The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one foot above the adjacent grade. 
(e)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
(f)  Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above. 
d.  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
1.  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the elevation and anchoring requirements in Article 4, section 4.2 (A) and (B), and section 4.3 (A). 
2.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
(a)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
(b)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions); or, 
(c)  Meet all the requirements for manufactured homes in Article 4, sections 4.2 and 4.3(D). 
612.15. Standards for the floodway district. The following provisions shall apply within the floodway district: 
a.  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments are prohibited unless certification such as hydrologic and hydraulic analyses (with supporting technical data) is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the zoning administrator. 
Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies with the town's endorsement for a conditional Flood Insurance Rate Map and floodway revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
b.  If Article 4, Section 4.6(A) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4. 
c.  The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is prohibited, except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring, elevation, and encroachment standards are met. 
612.16. Standards for the Special Floodplain District. 
The following provisions shall apply within the Special Floodplain District: 
Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as zones A1-30 and AE on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the Town of Bedford. 
Development activities in zones Al-30, AE, and AH, on the Town of Bedford's Flood Insurance Rate Map which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies with the town's endorsement for a conditional Flood Insurance Rate Map revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
612.17. Standards for Approximated Floodplain. The following provisions shall apply with the Approximate Floodplain District: 
The Approximated Floodplain District shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a 100-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as zone A on the maps accompanying the Flood Insurance Study. For these areas, the 100-year flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific 100-year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this elevation. For development proposed in the approximate floodplain the applicant must use technical methods that correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts, such as point on boundary, high water marks, or hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the zoning administrator. 
The zoning administrator reserves the right to require hydrologic and hydraulic analyses for any development. 
When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated to or above the base flood level. During the permitting process, the zoning administrator shall obtain: 
a.  The elevation of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; and, 
b.  If the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been floodproofed. 
612.18. Standards for the Shallow Flooding District. The following provisions shall apply within the Shallow Flooding District: 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than one foot freeboard above the flood depth level above the highest adjacent grade. When a freeboard is included in the height of a structure, the flood insurance premiums may be cheaper. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
1.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than one foot freeboard above the flood depth level above the highest adjacent grade; or, 
2.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to the specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
c.  Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
612.19. Standards for subdivision proposals. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and 
d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development proposals (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that exceed 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
612.20. Variances: Factors to be considered. Variances shall be issued only upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) after the board of zoning appeals has determined that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such variance will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre, deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases. Variances may be issued by the board of zoning appeals for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the provisions of this section. 
Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria of this section are met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
In passing upon applications for variances, the board of zoning appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of the zoning ordinance and consider the following additional factors: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the 100-year flood elevation. 
b.  The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others. 
c.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 
d.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners. 
e.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
f.  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
g.  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
h.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
i.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
j.  The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood. 
k.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site. 
l.  The historic nature of a structure. Variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
m.  Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this ordinance. 
The board of zoning appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters. 
Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief. 
The board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance, in writing and signed by {title of appropriate public official}, that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the 100-year flood elevation (a) increases the risks to life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 
A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the variances. Any variances that are issued shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
612.21. Existing structures in floodplain areas. A structure or use of a structure or premises which lawfully existed before the enactment of these provisions, but which is not in conformity with these provisions, may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
a.  Existing structures in the floodway area shall not be expanded or enlarged unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed expansion would not result in any increase in the base flood elevation. 
b.  Any modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a structure and/or use located in any floodplain areas to an extent or amount of less than 50 percent of its market value shall conform to the VA USBC. 
c.  The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a structure and/or use, regardless of its location in a floodplain area to an extent or amount of 50 percent or more of its market value shall be undertaken only in full compliance with this ordinance and shall require the entire structure to conform to the VA USBC.

It is the intent of this ordinance to recognize that the elimination of existing lots, buildings, and structures or uses that are not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety, and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance. It is therefore the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue, but not to encourage their survival, permit their expansion, or permit their use as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. Therefore, any structure or use of land existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance, and amendments thereof, but not in conformity with its regulations and provisions, may be continued subject to the following provisions: 
701.01. Lots of record. Where a lot of record at the time of enactment of this ordinance does not contain land of sufficient area or width to permit conformity with the dimensional requirements of this ordinance, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  When two or more adjoining and vacant lots with continuous frontage are in single ownership at the time of enactment of this ordinance or amendments thereto, and each of such lots have a width or lot area less than is required by the district in which they are located, such lots shall be platted and re-parceled so as to create one or more lots which conform to the minimum lot width and area requirements of the district. 
b.  Where a single nonconforming lot of record at the time of enactment or amendment of this ordinance is not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership, such lot may be used as a building site, provided that yard dimensions, and requirements other than those applying to area or width of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variances of yard requirements may be obtained only through appeal to the board as outlined in section 1104 herein. 
701.02. Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the time of enactment or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built in the district in which it is located by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yard dimensions, or other requirements, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
a.  Any structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by the building official may be restored to a safe condition, provided that the requirements of this section are met, and that the cost of restoration of the structure to a safe condition shall not exceed 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of the declaration of the building official. 
b.  No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity; any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 701.02(b) above, whenever repairs on or installation of plumbing fixtures in residential structures is required by law or administrative action of the health department or the building official, such alterations shall be permitted, provided that where such alterations require an addition to the structure, such addition shall be no nearer the lot line than permitted by the requirements of this ordinance. Where an existing residential structure exceeds these requirements the said addition shall extend no nearer the lot line than the existing building line. 
d.  Should a nonconforming structure be moved, it shall thereafter conform to the yard dimension requirements of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
e.  No nonconforming building or structure, if all or substantially all thereof is destroyed or razed, shall be restored in a nonconforming form or location for the continuance of a nonconforming use, except such a building or structure, if destroyed accidentally due to fire, explosion, or other accidental cause, may be restored in substantially the same form but without enlargement, for the continuance of the nonconforming use, provided the pre-existing use is commenced within a period of two years from the date of destruction. If the use of said building or structure which existed prior to its said destruction is not resumed within two years from the date of its said destruction, it shall be presumed to have been abandoned and discontinued, and any use thereafter of said property shall conform to the regulations of the district in which the land, structure or building is located. 
701.03. Nonconforming uses of land. Where a lawful use of land exists at the time of enactment or amendment of this ordinance that would not be permitted by the regulations imposed herein, such use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
a.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the time of enactment or amendment of this ordinance. 
b.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part, to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the time of enactment or amendment of this ordinance. 
c.  No such nonconforming use shall be altered, in whole or in part, to another use which does not conform to the requirements of this ordinance for the district in which the land is located. 
d.  In the event that such use ceases for any reason for a period of more than two years any subsequent use shall conform to all requirements of this ordinance for the district in which the land is located. 
e.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be constructed in connection with such nonconforming use. 
701.04. Nonconforming uses of structures. Where a lawful use involving individual structures, or of structures and premises in combination, exists at the time of enactment or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be permitted in the district in which it is located under the requirements of this ordinance, such use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
a.  No structure existing at the time of enactment or amendment of this ordinance devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, moved, or structurally altered, except repairs on or installation of plumbing fixtures required by law or administrative action of the health department or the building official, or the changing of interior partitions or interior remodeling; or except in changing the use of the structure to a conforming use. 
b.  A nonconforming use of a structure may be extended to include use of the entire structure, but shall not be extended to include either additional structures or land outside the structure. 
c.  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a period of two consecutive years except when government action impedes access to the premises; or when a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the structure and premises shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
d.  Where a structure which is used in combination with its premises for a use not in conformity with the regulations herein is removed or destroyed by any means to an extent more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, use of the land shall thereafter conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which it is located.  
Sec. 702. - Off-street parking, driveways, and entrances. 
Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any permitted or conditional use is established in accordance with this ordinance.

e.  Parking spaces for all dwellings shall be located on the same lot with the main buildings to be served. If an off-street parking space cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the main use is conducted, the zoning administrator may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 600 feet of the property line of such main use. Such vehicle parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 
f.  The required number of parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that a portion of the parking space required for an existing church, movie theater, or other use whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sunday. 
g.  Areas reserved for off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which it serves is discontinued or modified, except where equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator. 
h.  Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this ordinance in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or use. Existing off-street parking which is provided in an amount less than the requirements stated hereinafter shall not be further reduced. 
i.  Construction vehicles, trucks, and trailers of a gross weight of more than 6,000 pounds shall not be parked in the area between the front lot line and the setback line in any residential district. 
702.02. Parking space requirements for all districts. Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley, and shall be equal in area to the minimum requirements for the category of land use set forth.

702.03. Parking requirements: Limited Business District B-1, Limited Professional District LP, and Central Neighborhood Workplace CNW. 
In cases in which either existing lot or building sizes prohibit feasible satisfaction of the requirements related to minimum off-street parking, driveways, and/or entrances within the Limited Business District (B-1), Limited Professional District (LP), and the Central Neighborhood Workplace District (CNW) the zoning administrator may adjust or waive the parking requirements for either new or established permitted uses based on the following considerations: 
a.  The proximity of public parking (either on- or off-street) that could practically accommodate the use, building, and/or lot in question may be considered to satisfy the town's interests as represented by this section. 
b.  Within the LP District the development requirements for parking may be waived only if access to a minimum of two permanent off-street parking spaces can be demonstrated. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall issue a written statement documenting the reasons for any adjustment or waiver issued in conjunction with this section. For all activities requiring a zoning permit, the written statement shall be attached to said permit. 
(Ord. No. 19-7 , § 1, 6-25-2019) 
702.04. Site requirements. Excepting parking and driveways of one and two family dwellings, all off-street parking shall be laid out, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following requirements:

Sec. 704. - Control of vision clearance. 
No fence, wall, shrubbery, sign, marquee, or other similar obstruction to vision between the heights of 2½ and ten feet from the ground level shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two roads or railroad lines, or of a road intersection with a railroad line.  
Sec. 705. - Landscaping. 
It is recognized that the planting of trees and vegetation, as well as the conservation of existing trees and vegetation, can serve to significantly improve the quality of the physical environment. It is also recognized that the uncontrolled cutting or destruction of trees and wooded areas can significantly damage the physical environment, causing increased municipal costs, the encouragement of substandard development, and the reduction of property values. It is therefore in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to enact regulations that would promote the planting and preservation of landscape materials which: 
a.  Provide screening between incompatible land uses; 
b.  Provide for the protection of groundwater and air quality; 
c.  Promote traffic safety by controlling views; 
d.  Provide shade and enhancement for urban areas; and 
e.  Provide a natural habitat for wildlife. 
705.01. Application of this article. Except as otherwise provided, the landscaping requirement of this chapter shall apply to all land, public and private, located in the Town of Bedford's zoning jurisdiction. However, none of these requirements shall apply to: 
a.  Improvements or repairs to interior and exterior features of existing structures or buildings which do not result in expansion, reconstruction, nor changes in the type of occupancy as set forth by the Virginia State Building Code. 
b.  A single or two family detached dwelling on its own lot. 
705.02. General requirements and minimum standards. The following general requirements and minimum standards shall apply for all landscaping required by this code: 
a.  Existing tree cover within any proposed subdivision or development plan shall be retained to the greatest extent possible and taken fully into account in the design of the improvements and grading of any property. 
b.  Existing trees preserved on the site may be used to satisfy the requirements for landscaping. Any existing tree used to meet the requirements of this ordinance must be at least three inch caliper, in healthy condition, and be protected from construction activity. 
c.  The owner is responsible for maintaining all required plant material in good health. All plant materials shall conform to the Association of Nurserymen Standards for Nursery Stock. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants must be replaced within six months with locally adapted vegetation which conforms with the planting standards of this code. 
d.  All shade trees must be ten to 12 feet high and 1½ to two inch caliper when planted. All flowering trees must be six feet high and three quarters inch caliper when planted. All shrubs must be at least one gallon container size when planted. All plantings must be in a mulched planting bed. 
e.  Landscaping shall not obstruct the view of motorists using any street, private driveway, parking aisles, or the approach to any street intersection so as to constitute a traffic hazard or a condition dangerous to the public safety. Whenever the enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance may be deemed a traffic hazard, the zoning administrator may waive any or all requirements. 
705.03. Required landscaping. 
a.  Street trees shall be required along existing and proposed streets for any commercial, multifamily, townhouse or industrial development which is subject to site plan approved or not exempted in section 705.01 of this ordinance.

2.  On any street right-of-way on which utilities are not and will not be located, one shade tree shall be planted for every 50 feet, or portion thereof, of road frontage or one flowering or ornamental tree shall be planted for every 25 feet of street frontage at approximately 25 feet on center. 
 
b.  The following landscaping shall be required for parking lots consisting of five or more spaces: 
1.  When a parking lot fronts on an existing or proposed street, trees shall be planted in accordance with section 705.03(a). An additional row of low shrubs shall be required between the street and the parking lot consisting of at least one low shrub for every five feet of street frontage. 
2.  Interior landscaping for parking lots shall consist of one shade tree for every 12 parking spaces. 
c.  Vegetative screening shall be required at all side and rear yards when limited professional, commercial, industrial, multifamily or townhouse developments abut a single family residential district R-1, low density residential district R-1A, medium density residential district R-2, or a detached single family developed lot or subdivision in a high density residential district R-3. Such screening shall be at least six feet in height. If using approved vegetation, such screening shall consist of one row planted not more than ten feet on center or two staggered rows planted not more than 15 feet on center. Screening shall not be required when abutting an existing or proposed street, in which case the street tree (705.03a) requirements of this article shall apply. Alternate methods of screening such as walls or earth berms may be used in lieu of vegetative screening with the approval of the zoning administrator. 
 
d.  Suggested trees and shrubs.

705.04. Enforcement. 
a.  When the submission of a site plan is required by this ordinance, a landscape plan shall also be required. This plan shall include the following information; the location, size and type of all proposed plant materials, and verification that the minimum landscaping and screening requirements specified in this article have been met. If such information is already included on the site plan to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, this requirement may be waived. 
b.  Final certificates of zoning may be held pending completion of the landscaping to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator. A certified check, irrevocable letter of credit or other surety satisfactory to the town may be secured to allow for the issuance of the certificate prior to completion; however; such certificate should be obtained prior to issuance of a building permit.

n.  Internally illuminated, including neon signs, in residential or Limited Professional districts. 
904.05. Sign measurement rules. 
a.  Determination of sign area. The area of a sign shall be computed as the entire surface area within a single, continuous rectilinear perimeter enclosing all parts of the sign face, including the extreme limits of all of the letters, numbers, figures and/or symbols comprising the sign. The sign supports or support structure shall not be included in determining the sign area unless they are designed to form an integral background of the display. However, when a sign is placed within a wall, planter or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate purpose other than sign support, the area of such structure shall not be counted. 
b.  Area of signs with two or more sign faces. The area of a sign with two or more sign faces shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  Sign faces separated by an interior angle of 45 degrees or greater: Both sign faces shall be included; 
(2)  Sign faces separated by an interior angle of less than 45 degrees: One sign face shall be included; provide, however, the area of the largest sign face shall be used when two faces are unequal in area. 
c.  Calculation of allowable sign area on corner lots. On corner lots, the frontage shall be either: (1) the side fronting the street providing primary vehicle access, or (2) the side containing the main pedestrian entrance to the principal structure. Where neither of these methods clearly distinguished the front, or where both of these methods would identify a front, the administrator shall make the determination. For commercial or industrial uses, the front shall not be a primarily residential street. 
d.  Calculation of allowable sign area for freestanding and building-mounted signs. For freestanding and building-mounted signs, the following rules shall govern the determination of building frontage and allowable sign area: 
(1)  Buildings with one tenant or multiple tenants with access via common outside entrance: Building frontage shall be the one building face or wall architecturally designed as the front of the building and containing the main public entrance. Where more than one building wall meets this description, an average of the linear feet of those walls in question shall be used in calculating allowable sign area. 
(2)  Multiple-tenant buildings with individual outside entrances. Building frontage for each tenant shall be the portion of the frontage on the building wall that contains the tenant's main public entrance. Where a tenant space includes more than one outside building wall, only the one wall containing the primary public entrance shall be used in calculating allowable sign area. Where more than one building wall meets this description, an average of the linear feet of those walls in question shall be used in calculating allowable sign area. 
(3)  Regardless of the number of stories in a building, building frontage shall be determined by one measurement of the linear feet of the wall at a height not greater than ten feet abovegrade. 
f[e].  Determination of sign height. The height of a sign shall be calculated as the maximum vertical distance from the uppermost extremity of a sign or sign support and structure to the ground level at the base of the sign. For the purposes of this subsection, "ground level" shall not include any fill placed under or around the sign that has the effect of artificially raising the effective height of the sign. 
904.06. Sign illumination standards for districts where illumination of signs is permitted. 
a.  These signs shall not be located within 100 feet of a residential zoning district boundary. 
b.  Details of any illumination proposed as part of a sign must be provided by the applicant with the sign permit application. 
c.  The average level of illumination on the face or vertical surface of any sign shall not exceed three footcandles. 
d.  Lighting design shall be such that no excess light spill or glare occurs. No light from any illuminated sign shall cause or direct nonreflected light from the fixture to shine into or upon any building other than the building to which the sign is related or onto any adjoining property or right-of-way. 
e.  Any sign containing electrical components shall conform to current UL, ETL, CSA, or ULC standards and display a label from one of these recognized testing labs. 
f.  Externally illuminated signs. 
(1)  Light fixtures illuminating signs shall be carefully located, aimed and shielded so that light is directed only onto the sign face and is prevented from creating glare or lights shining into motorist or pedestrian eyes. Shielding shall be accomplished with architectural elements, landscaping, and/or specific lighting components, such as shields or louvers. 
(2)  The light fixture shall be designed to prevent light spill into the sky and shall not be aimed toward adjacent streets or properties. 
(3)  Neon signs shall have light lettering and logo on an opaque background only. 
g.  Internally lighted signs. 
(1)  The sign shall consist of light lettering, symbols and logo on an opaque or dark colored background only. 
(2)  Light sources internally illuminating signs shall be carefully located, aimed and shielded so that light is directed onto the message only. Shielding shall be accomplished with architectural elements and/or specific lighting components, such as shields or louvers within the sign. Lettering or symbols shall constitute no more than 40 percent of the surface area of the sign.

a.  When a property owner can show that his property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the effective date of the ordinance, or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or conditions of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of the ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property or where the board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of the ordinance.

No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds: (1) that the strict application of the ordinance would produce hardship; (2) that such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same district and the same vicinity; and (3) that the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance. 
c.  No such variance shall be authorized except after notice and hearing as required by Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204. 
d.  No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonable practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the ordinance.

Such person, firm, or corporations shall be deemed to be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during which any portion of any violation of this ordinance is committed, continued, or permitted by such person, firm, or corporation and shall be punishable as herein provided.  
Sec. 1504. - Enforcement. 
1504.01. General enforcement. The zoning administrator shall have all necessary authority on behalf of the council to administer and enforce this ordinance, including the ordering in writing of the remedying of any condition found in violation of this ordinance, and the bringing of legal action, including injunction, abatement, or other appropriate action or proceeding, to insure compliance with this ordinance. 
1504.02. Enforcement of performance standards. If, in the considered judgment of the zoning administrator, there is violation of performance standards set forth in section 610.01 and 611.01 of this ordinance, the following procedure shall be followed: 
a.  The zoning administrator shall give written notice by registered mail or other means insuring a signed receipt for such notice, to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation. Such notice shall indicate the particulars of the alleged violations and the reasons why the zoning administrator considers there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within a time limit as set in the notice. The notice shall state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within the time limit as set constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this chapter. The notice shall further state that on request of those to whom it is directed, technical determinations as described under the appropriate sections herein will be made, and that if violation as alleged is found, costs of the determinations will be charged against those responsible for the violation, and that if no violation is found to exist, costs of the determinations will be paid by the town. 
b.  If, within the time limit set, there is no reply but the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, he shall note "violation corrected" on his copy of the notice and shall retain it among his records, taking such other action as may be warranted by the circumstances of the case. 
c.  If there is no reply within the time limit set, thereby establishing violation as provided above, the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within the specified time limit, the administrator shall proceed to take or cause to be taken such action as warranted by the continuation of a violation after notice to cease. 
d.  If reply is received within the specified time limit indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the satisfaction of the administrator, but that more time will be required than was granted by the original notice, the zoning administrator may grant an extension of time if he deems such extension justified in the circumstances of the case, and if such extension will not, in his opinion, cause substantial peril to life, health or property. In action on requests for extension of time, the administrator shall in writing state his reasons for granting or refusing to grant such extension.

Competitive bidding on state-aid projects. 
No contract for the construction of any building or for an addition to or improvement of an existing building for which state funds of $100,000.00 or more, either by appropriation, grant-in-aid or loan, are used or are to be used for all or part of the cost of construction shall be let except after competitive bidding.

Any bidder or offeror, upon request, shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect bid and proposal records within a reasonable time after the opening of all bids but prior to award, except in the event that the town decides not to accept any of the bids and to reopen the contract. Otherwise, bid and proposal records shall be open to public inspection only after award of the contract. Any inspection of procurement transaction records under this section shall be subject to reasonable restrictions to ensure the security and integrity of the records. Trade secrets or proprietary information submitted by a bidder, offeror or contractor in connection with a procurement transaction shall not be subject to public disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act; however, the bidder, offeror or contractor must invoke the protections of this section prior to or upon submission of the data or other materials, and must identify the data or other materials to be protected and state the reasons why protection is necessary. 
(3)  Employment discrimination by contractor prohibited. Every contract of over $10,000.00 shall include the provisions in 1 and 2 below: 
1.  During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: 
a.  The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, religion, color, sex or national origin, except where religion, sex or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the contractor. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. 
b.  The contractor, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, will state that such contractor is an equal opportunity employer. 
c.  Notices, advertisements and solicitations placed in accordance with federal law, rule or regulation shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section. 
2.  The contractor will include the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs a, b and c in every subcontract or purchase order of over $10,000.00, so that the provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. 
(4)  Prequalification of bidders. The purchasing agent is authorized to prequalify bidders prior to any solicitation of bids, whether for goods, services, insurance or construction, by requiring prospective bidders to submit such information as the purchasing agent shall deem appropriate, including samples, financial reports, and references; provided, however, that opportunity to prequalify shall be given to any prospective bidder who has not been suspended or debarred under this ordinance. 
The purchasing agent may refuse to prequalify any prospective contractor, provided that written reasons for refusing to prequalify are made a part of the record in each case. The decision of the purchasing agent shall be final. 
In considering any request for prequalification, the purchasing agent shall determine whether there is reason to believe that the bidder possesses the management, financial soundness, and history of performance which indicate apparent ability to successfully complete the plans and specifications of the invitations for bid. The purchasing agent may employ standard forms designed to elicit necessary information, or may design other forms for that purpose. 
(4A)  Notice of invitation to bid. Notice inviting bids shall be published once in at least one official newspaper in the town and at least ten days preceding the last day set for the receipt of proposals. 
The newspaper notice required herein shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased or sold, shall state where bid blanks and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids. 
The purchasing agent shall also solicit sealed bids from all responsible prospective suppliers who have requested their names to be added to a "bidders' list" which the agent shall maintain, by sending other notice as will acquaint them with the proposed purchase or sale. In any case, invitations sent to the vendors on the bidders' list shall be limited to commodities that are similar in character and ordinarily handled by the trade group to which the invitations are sent. 
The agent shall also advertise all pending purchases or sales by notice posted on the public bulletin board in the town hall. 
Prequalification of a bidder shall not constitute a conclusive determination that the bidder is responsible, and such bidder may be rejected as nonresponsible on the basis of subsequently discovered information. 
Failure of a bidder to prequalify with respect to a given procurement shall not bar the bidder from seeking prequalification as to future procurements, or from bidding on procurements which do not require prequalification. 
(5)  Use of brand names. Unless otherwise provided in the invitation to bid, the name of a certain brand, make or manufacturer does not restrict bidders to the specific brand, make or manufacturer names; it conveys the general style, type, character, and quality of the article desired, and any article which the public body in its sole discretion determines to be the equal of that specified, considering quality, workmanship, economy of operation, and suitability for the purpose intended, shall be accepted. 
(6)  Comments on specifications. For complex equipment, supplies or repair, pre-bid conferences with prospective bidders are desirable after draft specifications have been prepared. Such conferences help to detect unclear provisions and tend to widen competition by removing unnecessarily restrictive language. Conferences on purchasing bids will be called by the purchasing agent and attended by a department representative and, if necessary, the town attorney. 
(7)  Bid bonds on construction contracts. 
A.  Except in cases of emergency, all bids or proposals for construction contracts in excess of $25,000.00 shall be accompanied by a bid bond from a surety company selected by the bidder which is legally authorized to do business in Virginia, as a guarantee that if the contract is awarded to such bidder, that bidder will enter into the contract for the work mentioned in the bid. The amount of the bid bond shall not exceed five percent of the amount bid (Section 2.2-4336). 
B.  No forfeiture under a bid bond shall exceed the lesser of: (i) the difference between the bid for which the bond was written and the next low bid, or (ii) the face amount of the bid bond. 
(8)  Bonds for other than construction contracts. At the discretion of the purchasing agent, bidders may be required to submit with their bid a bid bond, or a certified check, in an amount to be determined by the purchasing agent and specified in the invitation to bid, which shall be forfeited to the town as liquidated damages upon the bidder's failure to execute a contract awarded to him or upon the bidder's failure to furnish any required performance or payment bonds in connection with a contract awarded to him. 
(This is an exception adopted by the town, but recommend deleting this section and following the VPPA guidelines, which are found in section 2.2-4337.) 
(9)  Rejection of bids. An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other solicitation may be cancelled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part when the town manager determines that it is in the best interest of the town to do so. The reasons therefor shall be made a part of the record in the matter. 
(10)  Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded; the record and each bid shall be open to public inspection. 
(11)  Withdrawal of bid due to error. 
A.  A bidder for a public construction contract, other than a contract for construction or maintenance of public highways, may withdraw his bid from consideration if the price bid was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of a bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. 
The procedure for bid withdrawal must be stated in the advertisement for bids. The procedure for withdrawal of bids is: 
The purchasing agent shall select one of these procedures. 
1.  The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure; or 
2.  The bidder shall submit to the governing body or designated official his original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid within one day after the date fixed for submission of bids. The work papers shall be delivered by the bidder in person or by registered mail at or prior to the time fixed for submission of bids. The bids shall be opened one day following the time fixed by the town for the submission of bids. Thereafter, the bidder shall have two hours after the opening of bids within which to claim in writing any mistake as defined herein and withdraw his bid. The contract shall not be awarded by the town until the two-hour period has elapsed. Such mistake shall be proved only from the original work papers, documents and materials delivered as required herein. 
B.  Procedures for the withdrawal of bids for other than construction contracts may be established by the purchasing agent. 
C.  No bid may be withdrawn under this section when the result would be the awarding of the contract or another bid of the same bidder or of another bidder in which the ownership of the withdrawing bidder is more than five percent. 
D.  If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this section, the lowest remaining bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
E.  No bidder who is permitted to withdraw a bid shall, for compensation, supply any material or labor to or perform any subcontract or other work agreement for the person or firm to whom the contract is awarded or otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, from the performance of the project for which the withdrawn bid was submitted. 
F.  If the governing body denies the withdrawal of a bid under the provisions of this section, it shall notify the bidder in writing stating the reasons for its decision. 
(12)  Bid evaluation. In determining the "lowest responsible bidder", in addition to price, the agent shall consider: 
1.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
2.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
3.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder; 
4.  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services; 
5.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or service; 
6.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
7.  The quality, availability and adaptability of the goods or services to the particular use required; 
8.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; 
9.  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid. 
(13)  Bid award. Bids shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. When the terms and conditions of multiple bids are so provided in the invitation to bid, awards may be made to more than one bidder. 
Unless cancelled or rejected, a responsible bid from the lowest responsible bidder shall be accepted as submitted except that if the bid from the lowest responsible bidder exceeds available funds, the town may negotiate with the apparent low bidder to obtain a contract price within available funds. 
When the award is not given to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons for placing the order elsewhere shall be prepared by the agent and filed with the other papers relating to the transaction. 
(14)  [Reserved.] 
(15)  Multi-step sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
(16)  Contract pricing arrangement. Except as prohibited herein, public contracts may be awarded on a fixed price or cost reimbursement basis, or on any other basis that is not prohibited. 
Subject to the limitations of this section, any type of contract which is appropriate to the procurement and which will promote the best interests of the town may be used; provided that the use of a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract or a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-construction-cost contract are prohibited. A cost reimbursement contract may be used only when a determination is made in writing that such contract is likely to be less costly to the town than any other type or that it is impracticable to obtain the supply, service, or construction item required except under such a contract. 
(16a)  Multi-term contracts. 
(a)  Specified period. Unless otherwise provided by law, a contract for goods, services or insurance may be entered into for any period of time deemed to be in the best interests of the town provided the term of the contract and conditions of renewal or extension, if any, are included in the solicitation and funds are available for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting. Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods shall be subject to the availability and appropriation of funds therefor. 
(b)  Cancellation due to unavailability of funds in succeeding fiscal periods. When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract shall be cancelled. 
(17)  Contract modification. A public contract may include provisions for modification of the contract during performance, but no fixed-price contract may be increased by more than 25 percent of the amount of the contract or $10,000.00, whichever is greater, without the advance written approval of the governing body (Section 2.2-4309). 
(18)  Retainage on construction contracts. 
A.  In any public contract for construction which provides for progress payments in installments based upon an estimated percentage of completion, the contractor shall be paid at least 95 percent of the earned sum when payment is due, with not more than five percent being retained to assure faithful performance of the contract. All amounts withheld may be included in the final payment. 
B.  Any subcontract for a public project which provides for similar progress payments shall be subject to the same limitations. 
(19)  Performance and payment bonds. 
A.  Upon the award of any public construction contract exceeding $25,000.00 awarded to any prime contractor, such contractor shall furnish to the town the following bonds: 
1.  A performance bond in the sum of the contract amount conditioned upon the faithful performance of the contract in strict conformity with the plans, specifications and conditions of the contract. 
2.  A payment bond in the sum of the contract amount. Such bond shall be for the protection of claimants who have and fulfill contracts to supply labor or materials to the prime contractor to whom the contract was awarded, or to any subcontractors, in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract, and shall be conditioned upon the prompt payment for all such material furnished or labor supplied or performed in the prosecution of the work. "Labor or materials" shall include public utility services and reasonable rentals of equipment, but only for periods when the equipment rented is actually used at the site. 
B.  Each of such bonds shall be executed by one or more surety companies selected by the contractor which are legally authorized to do business in Virginia. 
C.  Bonds shall be made payable to the town. 
D.  Each of the bonds shall be filed with the town which awarded the contract, or a designated office or official thereof. 
E.  Nothing in this section shall preclude the purchasing agent from requiring payment or performance bonds for construction contracts below $25,000.00. 
F.  Nothing in this section shall preclude such contractor from requiring each subcontractor to furnish a payment bond with surety thereon in the sum of the full amount of the contract with such subcontractor conditioned upon the payment to all persons who have and fulfill contracts which are directly with the subcontractor for performing labor and furnishing materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the subcontract. 
(20)  Action on performance bond. No action against the surety on a performance bond shall be brought unless within one year after: (i) completion of the contract, including the expiration of all warranties and guarantees, or (ii) discovery of the defect or breach of warranty, if the action be for such. 
(21)  Actions on payment bonds. 
A.  Subject to the provisions of subsection B hereof, any claimant who has performed labor or furnished materials in accordance with the contract for which a payment bond has been given, and who has not been paid in full therefor before the expiration of 90 days after the day on which such claimant performed the last of such labor or furnished the last of such materials for which he claims payment, may bring an action on such payment bond to recover any amount due him for such labor or material, and may prosecute such action to final judgment and have execution on the judgment. The obligee named in the bond need not be named a party to such action. 
B.  Any claimant who has a direct contractual relationship with any subcontractor from whom the contractor has not required a subcontractor payment bond under section 4-101(19) but who has no contractual relationship, expressed or implied, with such contractor, may bring an action on the contractor's payment bond only if he has given written notice to such contractor within 180 days from the day on which the claimant performed the last of the labor or furnished the last of the materials for which he claims payment, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the person for whom the work was performed or to whom the material was furnished. Any claimant who has a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor from whom the contractor has required a subcontractor payment bond under section 4-101(19) but who has no contractual relationship, expressed or implied, with such contractor, may bring an action on the subcontractor's payment bond.

(Ord. No. 15-22, § 2, 8-25-2015)  
Sec. 4-102. - Competitive negotiation. 
(1)  Definition of competitive negotiation. Competitive negotiation is a method of source selection which involves individual discussions between the town and the offeror on the basis of responses to the town's request for proposals. The source selection method of competitive negotiation incorporates section 4-101(2)(6), (9), (16), (17), in addition to the provisions outlined in section 4-102 and section 4-103. 
(2)  Request for proposals. Request for proposals shall be in writing and indicate in general terms that which is sought to be procured, specifying the factors which will be used in evaluating the proposal and containing or incorporating by reference the other applicable contractual terms and conditions, including any unique capabilities or qualifications which will be required of the contractor. 
(3)  Public notice. At least ten days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals, public notice shall be given by posting in a public area normally used for posting of public notices or by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the contract is to be performed, or both. In addition, proposals may be solicited directly from potential contractors. 
(4)  Evaluation factors and award. Selection shall be made of two or more offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals, on the basis of the factors involved in the request for proposals, including price if so stated in the request for proposal. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the offerors so selected. Price shall be considered, but need not be the sole determining factor. After negotiations have been conducted with each offeror so selected, the purchasing agent shall select the offeror which, in his opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that offeror. Should the purchasing agent determine in writing and in his sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror.  
Sec. 4-103. - Contracting for professional services by competitive negotiation. 
(1)  Authority. Professional services may be procured by competitive negotiation. The process includes section 4-101(2)(6), (9), (16), (17) and section 4-102(3) and (4). 
(2)  Discussion and award. The purchasing agent shall engage in individual discussions with all offerors deemed fully qualified, responsible and suitable on the basis of initial responses and with emphasis on professional competence, to provide the required services. Repetitive informal interviews shall be permissible. Such offerors shall be encouraged to elaborate on their qualifications and performance data or staff expertise pertinent to the proposed project as well as alternative concepts. These discussions may encompass nonbinding estimates of total project costs, including where appropriate, design, construction and life cycle costs. Methods to be utilized in arriving at price for services may also be discussed. Proprietary information from competing offerors shall not be disclosed to the public or to competitors. At the conclusion of discussion, outlined herein, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request for proposal and all information developed in the selection process to this point, the purchasing agent shall select in the order of preference two or more offerors whose professional qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. Negotiations shall then be conducted, beginning with the offeror ranked first. If a contract satisfactory and advantageous to the town can be negotiated at a price considered fair and reasonable, the award shall be made to that offeror. Otherwise, negotiations with the offeror ranked first shall be formally terminated and negotiations conducted with the offeror ranked second, and so on until such a contract can be negotiated at a fair and reasonable price. Should the purchasing agent determine in writing and in his sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror.  
Sec. 4-104. - Sole source procurement. 
Upon a determination in writing by the purchasing agent that there is only one source practicably available for that which is to be procured, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that source without competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiation. The writing shall document the basis for this determination and shall be filed in the purchasing agent's office.  
Sec. 4-105. - Emergency purchases. 
In case of emergency, a contract may be awarded without competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiation; however, such procurement shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file. 
An emergency shall be deemed to exist when a breakdown in machinery or equipment and/or a threatened termination of essential services or a dangerous condition develops, or when any unforeseen circumstances arise causing curtailment or diminution of an essential service or where materials or services are needed to prevent loss of life or property.  
Sec. 4-106. - Small purchases. 
1.  All purchases made by the town under the "small purchases section" unless exempted by Section 4-107 Purchase of Used Equipment, shall fall into one of the following categories: 
A.  Purchases under $5,000.00 in value. 
B.  Purchases between $5,000.00 and $50,000.00 in value. 
2.  Purchases under $5,000.00 in value. Purchases in this group should be done solely by the department head. The $5,000.00 applies to the total of all items purchased on an invoice. Often small purchases of this type are for routine items. 
3.  Purchases between $5,000.00 and $50,000.00 in value. Purchases in this group should be accomplished by the use of three written quotations. Requests for written quotations are normally obtained by the purchasing agent or delegated to the department head. To initiate the written quotation, the using department should submit a completed requisition to the purchasing agent, including a list of at least three possible vendors for approval. Once approval has been obtained the purchasing agent or the department head will issue the request for written quotations by writing to vendors (either via letter or e-mail). The request must specify a reply date and time and must be obtained on the vendor's letter head. This is the most desirous method of acquiring necessary items and should be used when proper planning allows sufficient time. The use of written quotations requires adequate time for preparation, mailing, faxing, or e-mailing, receipt, and award, generally two or three weeks from receipt of requisition. All quotations received after the reply date and time are nonresponsive and cannot be considered. 
4.  Purchases over $50,000.00 in value. Purchases in this group should be accomplished by the use of formal sealed bids. A sealed bid usually will involve more detailed specifications and special conditions. An opening time and date will be set and all bids will remain sealed until that time. Bidder names will not be announced until bid opening. Sealed bids must be advertised in a local newspaper and solicitation for bids must be mailed to a minimum of three possible vendors. To initiate the sealed bid process, the using department should submit a completed requisition to the purchasing agent for approval. Once the approval has been obtained the purchasing agent will issue the request for sealed bids.

(Section 4-106(4).) 
2.  Complete information in writing describing the item must be provided to the purchasing office along with the price being offered by the seller.

The debarment shall not be for a period of more than three years. After consultation with the town attorney, the governing body or its designee is authorized to suspend a person from consideration for award of contracts if there is probable cause to believe that the person has engaged in any activity which might lead to debarment. The suspension shall not be for a period exceeding three months. The causes for debarment include:

(b)  A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts; provided that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment. 
5.  Any other cause the governing body or its designee determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility as a town contractor including debarment by another governmental entity for any cause in this ordinance; and for violation of the ethical standards set forth in this ordinance.

If no bid bond was posted, a bidder refused withdrawal of a bid under the provisions of section 4-101(11), prior to appealing, shall deliver to the purchasing agent a certified check or cash bond in the amount of the difference between the bid sought to be withdrawn and the next lowest bid. Such security shall be released only upon a final determination that the bidder was entitled to withdraw the bid. 
C.  If, upon appeal, it is determined that the decision refusing withdrawal of the bid was arbitrary or capricious, the sole relief shall be withdrawal of the bid.  
Sec. 7-103. - Determination of nonresponsibility. 
A.  Any bidder who, despite being the apparent low bidder, is determined not to be a responsible bidder for a particular contract shall be notified in writing.

This decision shall be final unless the bidder or offeror appeals within ten days of the written decision by invoking administrative procedures meeting the standards of section 7-107 or section 7-108 of this ordinance. 
B.  If prior to an award it is determined that the decision to award is arbitrary or capricious, then the sole relief shall be a finding to that effect.

In no event shall the performing contractor be entitled to lost profits. 
C.  Where the designated official or appeals board determines, after a hearing held following reasonable notice to all bidders, that there is probable cause to believe that a decision to award was based on fraud or corruption or on an act in violation of the ethics in public contracting article, the designated official or appeals board may enjoin the award of the contract to a particular bidder.

Sec. 7-106. - Stay of award during protest. 
An award need not be delayed for the period allowed a bidder or offeror to protest, but in the event of a timely protest, no further action to award the contract will be taken unless there is a written determination that proceeding without delay is necessary to protect the public interest or unless the bid or offer would expire.  
Sec. 7-107. - Contractual disputes.

However, written notice of the contractor's intention to file such claim shall have been given at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim is based.

C.  A bidder, offeror or contractor may bring an action in the appropriate circuit court challenging a proposed award or the award of a contract, which shall be reversed only if the petitioner establishes that the proposed award or the award is not an honest exercise of discretion, but rather is arbitrary or capricious or not in accordance with the Constitution of Virginia, statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of the invitation to bid or request for proposal. 
D.  If injunctive relief is granted, the court, upon request of the town shall require the posting of reasonable security to protect the town.

Editor's note Printed herein is the joint tourism program ordinance of the town, Agreement of November 15, 2005, as adopted by the council. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
 
[Sec.] 1. - Purpose. 
The purpose of the agreement is to establish and administer a tourism program that shall serve an area known as "the Bedford area", to include the entire geographical boundaries of the town and county. The program is intended to encompass all aspects of a comprehensive tourism program, including but not limited to, staffing, funding, planning and executing of tourism related programs and activities, and the development and operations of a state certified local/regional visitor information center.  
[Sec.] 2. - Oversight. 
(a)  The Bedford area tourism program shall function as a joint tourism department of local government and shall be administered by the county administrator of the county and the town manager of the town.

(b)  The county administrator and the town manager shall have control of and exercise general supervision, or direct supervision when deemed appropriate, over all decisions relating to staffing, budgeting, and overall operations. On any issue where the town manager and the county administrator cannot agree upon the decision, they shall certify the issue to the chairman of the board of supervisors or to the town mayor who shall act as a tie breaker on a rotating basis, with the county chairman to so act in odd numbered years and the town mayor to so act in even numbered years.

ARTICLE V. - JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT[6] 
AN ORDINANCE APPROVING THE AMENDED COUNTY OF BEDFORD - TOWN OF BEDFORD JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH-SHARING AGREEMENT 
WHEREAS, Bedford County and the Town of Bedford submitted to the Commission on Local Government for its review a Joint Economic Development and Growth Sharing Agreement dated June 2, 1997; and 
WHEREAS, the Commission on Local Government conducted a public hearing required by law on August 18, 1997, and has submitted its report dated November, 1997, making certain recommendations; and 
WHEREAS, the town council and the board of supervisors pursuant to the recommendations of the Commission on Local Government have agreed to modifications in amendments of the Joint Economic Development and Growth Sharing Agreement which are incorporated in a revised Joint Economic Development and Growth Sharing Agreement dated February 9, 1998; and 
WHEREAS, the town council desires to adopt the modified agreement pursuant to section 15.1-3400; 
NOW THEREFORE BE ORDAINED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL, the town council approves the agreement as modified which is dated February 9, 1998, and authorizes the mayor and town clerk to execute the agreement on behalf of the Town of Bedford. The town council authorizes and directs the town manager and town attorney to petition the Circuit Court for an order affirming the proposed agreement. 
I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and exact copy of an Ordinance adopted at a regular meeting of the council of the Town of Bedford, Virginia, held on February 10, 1998, at which said meeting a quorum was present and voted. 
JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH SHARING AGREEMENT 
This Agreement, made and entered into this 9th day of February, 1998 by and between BEDFORD COUNTY, VIRGINIA (the "county"), party of the first part; and THE TOWN OF BEDFORD, VIRGINIA (herein referred to as the "town"), party of the second part. 
RECITALS 
1.  The county and the town historically have provided many public services for their respective citizens through joint contracts and other cooperative arrangements, such jointly provided services including the court and commonwealth attorney's services, welfare, health, public schools, and regional libraries. 
2.  The board of supervisors of Bedford County (the "board") and the town council for the Town of Bedford (the "town council") are aware that the economic vitality of the Town of Bedford and the immediately adjoining areas of Bedford County are tied together and that economic and industrial expansion in either the town or the adjoining areas of the county provides increased employment opportunities and economic vitality for the citizens of both jurisdictions. 
3.  The availability of public water and public sewer services is a particularly critical factor in the commercial and industrial development of an area, and the board and the town council both perceive that the unavailability of these services in the central area of the county surrounding the town may have restricted development which would otherwise have occurred in the area of the county which adjoins the town. 
4.  The board and the town council have determined that desirable commercial and industrial development in the town and the immediate surrounding areas of the county can only be accomplished successfully through joint efforts to develop industrial parks and other economic development projects, through coordination and joint efforts to provide utility services for such projects, and through the sharing between the two jurisdictions of taxes and revenues generated by such projects. 
5.  As a result of discussions between the board and the town council, the county and the town have agreed jointly to develop and promote for industrial and commercial growth certain designated areas which consist of: (i) an industrial park site on property within the town near Independence Boulevard, and (ii) four areas of the county immediately outside the town limits. These "economic development areas" are described specifically in "attachment A." which includes maps of each area. 
Now, therefore, in consideration of the recitals herein and mutual covenants, policies and agreements herein contained, and for the purpose of joint economic development and distributing equitably the revenues produced from such projects, the parties agree as follows:

Editor's note Printed herein is the Joint Economic Development ordinance of the town, agreement of February 9, 1998, as adopted by the council. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used.

[DIVISION] I. - PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER UTILITIES 
 
Sec. 1.01. - Water and sewer development. 
The town and county covenant and agree to begin immediate negotiations for the formulation of a strategic long range plan for future water and sewer development in the town and the central area of Bedford County. The town and county agree that the Bedford County public service authority shall participate in all such negotiations.  
Sec. 1.02. - Agreement to extend sewer and water lines. 
The town has a moratorium on additional connections to its water and sewer systems outside the town limits, and the town agrees to modify its moratorium in order to provide sewer and water connections for commercial and industrial development in the economic development areas located within the county in accordance with the provisions set forth hereinbelow. 
The town represents to the best of its knowledge its water treatment plant has capacity to provide anticipated water needs within the economic development areas, and the town represents that it is proceeding at a cost of approximately $4.5 million to upgrade its existing sewage treatment plant in order to provide an additional capacity of 500,000 gallons per day. 
The town agrees to extend water and sewer utility services into the economic development areas of the county by extending existing trunk lines into the county as funds are available and by allowing connections under the following terms and conditions: 
(A)  Connections to town water and sewer systems. As soon as the parties have obtained statutory approval of this agreement as set forth in article IV, upon application by owners of property within the economic development areas the town shall allow immediate sewer and water connections for any industrial or commercial developments within those areas provided: (i) lines are available to provide service to the site or the application includes provisions for making such service available to the property; (ii) the town has capacity to serve the projected use; and (iii) such connection is made in accordance with other town policies, including payment of fees and such other terms as would be required for utility connections to properties within the town. 
(B)  Extension of town sewer and water pipelines. The parties agree that the existing town water and sewer pipelines shall be extended in order to provide water and sewer services within the four county economic development areas by extending trunk lines from existing facilities into each respective development area. 
The priorities and schedules for truck line extensions will be determined jointly by the town council and board of supervisors and may be amended from time to time based upon the need for utilities for commercial and industrial development within the specific areas and based upon the projected tax revenues to be shared from such development. The parties in setting priorities for truck line extensions shall give due consideration to engineering studies and recommendations. Construction shall commence as funds are available, it being anticipated that funds for construction will be accumulated only as long as necessary to provide for efficient construction of trunk lines. 
The parties agree that the first priority for truck line extension shall be from the town limits east along U.S. Route 460 in order to provide service as far as the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) offices. In order to fund the costs of expanding the town water and sewer systems and to provide truck line service into the four economic development areas, the town agrees to set aside and to expend for such development costs 50 percent of the tax revenues derived by the town from the economic development areas located in the county which are paid pursuant to the provisions of this agreement (until one main truck line has been completed to serve each area). The town's financial obligation to provide for extension of its services into the economic development areas of the county shall be limited to funding from the shared tax revenues and to contributions designated for such purpose from other non-town sources, including, but not limited to, private developers. The costs of extension of services shall include the cost of engineering and feasibility studies as well as actual costs of construction in installation and new equipment within and without the town limits, including the installation of pump stations, the laying of new pipes, and the replacement of existing pipes, and such other expenses as may be required in order to provide required trunk lines and services. 
The parties contemplate that there will be an initial engineering study determining the requirements and costs in order to extend the water and sewer lines along the Route 460 corridor eastwardly to the VDOT office building. The parties contemplate that additional engineering studies and feasibility reports will be required in order to set priorities and to schedule extensions into the other economic development areas. 
(C)  Limited residential connections. Notwithstanding the above limitation of additional sewer and water connections outside the town limits to commercial and industrial developments only, the town agrees to use its best efforts to provide connections to residential buildings located within the county economic development areas which are existing as of the date of this agreement should there be a failure of the private sewer or water systems serving the specific residence and if town connections are available under existing town policies. 
(D)  Town policies. All extensions of sewer and water utilities hereunder shall be in accordance with the Town of Bedford policies and specifications for providing of such services within the town limits as such policies may be amended from time to time. (This includes all industrial wastewater pretreatment requirements.) All pipelines shall become part of the town utility systems, and the town will be responsible for collection of fees and charges and for the maintenance and repair of the lines. Requested utility connections shall be subject to availability of capacity and subject to terms of any town, county, state or federal regulations. 
The town's obligation to extend water and sewer services and to continue to provide such services shall be conditioned upon enactment by the county of ordinances and regulations necessary to implement in the county the town's water and sewer policies. (Construction specifications shall be submitted for review and shall be approved by the town before construction commences.)  
[DIVISION] II. - REVENUE SHARING OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PARK PROJECTS 
 
Sec. 2.01. - Sharing of tax revenues. 
The county subject to annual appropriation and the town agree in perpetuity to share equally all local taxes on real estate, personal property and machinery and tools, merchant's capital, sales and use taxes, and all business, professional and occupational taxation and any other taxes now and hereafter imposed or generated in respect to properties and activities within the economic development areas (including the industrial park site located within the town and the four designated areas located within the county.) Such shared taxes shall not include those taxes which pursuant to state or federal statutes are dedicated for a specific use or for which a specific use is prescribed (e.g., 911 tax). Shared taxes shall be transmitted by the collecting jurisdiction within 90 days of the due date or of the time of collection, whichever occurs later. 
If the county fails to pay to the town an amount equal to one-half of such taxes collected within 90 days of collection and such default continues for a period of 90 days after notice by the town, then the town may incorporate within its boundaries any portions of the economic development area for which the town is providing water and sewer services, which right shall be exercised by the adoption of an ordinance by the town providing for a change of boundaries. Incorporation of the affected economic development area shall take effect immediately upon the date specified in the ordinance without any further action by either jurisdiction. (This provision is to assure the sharing of tax revenues should the board of supervisors not appropriate sufficient funds to result in such tax sharing, it being understood that the sharing of tax revenues by the county is subject to appropriation by the board of supervisors under state law.) It is understood that revenues within any such area which may become incorporated within the town limits under any statute or agreement thereafter shall be shared by the town with the county under the provisions of this section. 
The parties agree that no tax incentives shall be provided within an area of shared revenues unless both parties agree.  
Sec. 2.02. - Sharing of other revenues. 
The town agrees that for so long as the Joint Industrial Development Authority created in article III is in existence to transfer to the Joint Industrial Development Authority one half of the net income to the town electric department from electric sales generated from the economic development areas. The town agrees specifically to pay to the Joint Industrial Development Authority at the end of each fiscal year one half of its net income derived from commercial and industrial electric sales within the economic development areas based upon the electric sales within said areas. The methodology for computation of sharing the net income from electric sales is shown on "attachment B."

The parties specifically agree to share the proceeds of any new taxes which shall be collected by either jurisdiction in respect to the economic development areas.  
Sec. 2.04. - [Commencing payment; pro rated time periods.] 
Sharing of all revenues and taxes shall commence on the first day of the month following the effective date of statutory approval under section 4.01. Where taxes are attributable in part to time periods prior to the effective date, the tax payments will be pro rated accordingly.  
[DIVISION] III. - JOINT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY 
 
Sec. 3.01. - Creation of authority. 
The town council and the board agree to the creation of a Joint Industrial Authority pursuant to the authority of section 15.1-1387 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. The Joint Industrial Authority shall be created by a joint resolution which shall be adopted by the governing bodies and shall be in substantially the same form as the proposed ordinance which is attached as "attachment C."  
Sec. 3.02. - Budgets and operating expenses. 
The town and the county shall equally contribute to the operations of the Joint Industrial Authority. (The one half of the electric department revenues to be paid by the town to the Industrial Development Authority under section 2.02 shall not be considered as part of the town's contribution toward the operations of the Joint Industrial Development Authority under section 3.02.) 
Each year, on or before the 15th of January, the board of directors of the Joint Industrial Authority shall prepare and submit to the town and county a capital improvement budget for their approval, modification or rejection. Capital expenditures shall not include day-to-day maintenance and repair of buildings and facilities. The capital improvements budget shall include proposed economic development projects for the upcoming year. 
Each year, on or before the 15th of January, the board of directors of the Joint Industrial Authority shall present to the town and to the county for their approval an operating budget for the next fiscal year. 
The respective budgets shall be determined by the lesser amount approved by either of the governing bodies. 
Each year the Joint Industrial Authority shall be audited by an independent auditing service paid for by its board of directors, and copies of the audit shall be furnished to both the town and county at their first regular meetings after the close of the fiscal year or thereafter as is reasonably expedient.  
Sec. 3.03. - Powers of authority. 
Except as limited by this agreement, the Joint Industrial Authority shall have all the powers granted to such an authority by chapter 33 of title 15.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950 as amended.  
Sec. 3.04. - Area of operation. 
The Joint Industrial Development Authority shall promote economic and industrial development within such areas of the town specifically designated by the parties and within the economic development areas of the county described in this agreement.  
Sec. 3.05. - Transfer of properties within town industrial site.

[DIVISION] IV. - STATUTORY APPROVALS 
 
Sec. 4.01. - [Recognition of provisions requiring shared taxes.] 
The parties recognize that the provisions of section 2.01 which provide for sharing of taxes and for boundary line adjustments if the county fails to share revenue in respect to specified projects under the provisions of section 15.1-21.2 and section 15.1-1167.1 are subject to submission and review by the commission on local government as provided in paragraph 4 of section 15.1-945.3. In view of the fact that the town's agreements in article I to provide public water and sewer utilities for such development areas is based upon the tax sharing of economic development/industrial park projects found in article II of this agreement, the parties agree that the provisions of article I and of article II shall be contingent upon review of the provisions by the commission on local government, upon enactment of required ordinances by the governing bodies, upon adoption of a traditional zoning ordinance by the Bedford County board of supervisors covering the economic development areas in the county and upon affirming the provisions of the voluntary agreement by the three judge court as required under section 15.1-1167.1.  
Sec. 4.02. - Interim development of industrial park in the Town of Bedford and extension of services into economic development area east of the Town of Bedford. 
The parties agree that it is in the best interests of the jurisdictions to proceed with the development of the industrial park within the limits of the Town of Bedford and with the immediate extension of services to certain properties located within the Economic Development Area along the U.S. Route 460 corridor east of the town limits prior to the statutory approval of the provisions for sharing of revenues and taxes as set forth in section 4.01. 
Accordingly, the board of supervisors upon execution of this agreement and prior to obtaining statutory approval shall advance to the town an amount equal to the sums actually expended by the town for development of the industrial park site within the town up to the date of the agreement and shall share equally with the town the costs of further development of the industrial park site through FY 97-98. Such advances by the county shall not exceed the sum of $425,000.00. Upon obtaining the statutory approval of this agreement as referred to above, the industrial park property shall be conveyed to the Joint Industrial Development Authority pursuant to the provisions of section 3.05 and all prior expenditures with respect to the industrial park site shall be treated as contributions by the county and by the town respectively to the Joint Industrial Development Authority. If statutory approvals have not been obtained by December 31, 1998, then such advances by the county shall be treated as loans to the town, without interest, and shall be repaid by the town in quarterly installments over a period of not more than five years or according to such other schedule of repayment as the parties may agree. 
A projected budget for the development expenses of the industrial park site located within the limits of the Town of Bedford for FY 97-98 is attached as "attachment D." 
Prior to obtaining the statutory approvals described above and immediately upon execution of this agreement, the town agrees to modify its moratorium upon additional connections to the water and sewer systems outside the town limits by allowing additional sewer and water connections within the following properties: 
(A)  The entire existing WalMart complex described on the County Tax Maps as Insert 130B; 
(B)  A 4.97 acre tract, a part of Tax Parcel No. 130-A-9, shown as Tract 9A on a Plat of Survey prepared by Donnie W. Slusher, dated October 21, 1996, Commission No. 8911 (Andrew M. Ulmer).

The obligation to provide such connections shall be conditioned upon availability of lines and upon the town's capacity to provide services, and such connections shall be subject to all existing town policies and without cost to the town. 
As soon as the statutory approval have been obtained, the provisions for additional utility extensions into the county areas under article I and for the sharing of revenues under article II shall go into effect immediately.  
[DIVISION] V. - [TERMS OF AGREEMENT] 
 
Sec. 5.01. - [Agreement binding to successive governing bodies.] 
This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the future governing bodies of the jurisdiction and upon any successors to the town or county. Such binding effect shall be: (a) subject to statutory approvals described in section 4.01; and (b) subject to appropriate equitable adjustment in the case of reversion by the town to town status or to some other form of government similarly structured as a constituent element of Bedford County. The parties intended that the basic concepts of cooperative development of the economic development areas will survive a reversion by the town to town status or to some other form of government similarly structured as a constituent element of Bedford County without creating a significant financial advantage to either party. In case of such governmental restructuring, the parties shall submit to the applicable court an amendment approved by both parties or either party may request an equitable adjustment by the court convened under section 15.1-965.16c, 3 or such laws as shall have been made and provided and in effect at such time in order to accomplish the objective stated herein.  
Sec. 5.02. - [Alteration of agreement by consent of the town and county.] 
This agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented, in whole or in part, by mutual consent of the town and the county in a written document of equal formality and dignity, executed by duly authorized representatives of each jurisdiction; provided, however, that changes affecting tax and revenue sharing and additions to the designated development areas shall be subject to any additional review and approval by state agencies and courts as may be required by the statutes of Virginia as amended from time to time.  
Sec. 5.03. - Severability. 
In the event that any section, paragraph or provision of this agreement shall be declared illegal or invalid or unconstitutional by final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment of invalidity shall not invalidate any other section, paragraph or provision hereof, and all parts of this agreement not expressly held invalid shall remain in full force and effect, and it is agreed and understood that this agreement would have been entered into by the parties without such invalid provision.

8.  The authority designates the Series 2004A Note as a "qualified tax-exempt obligation" for the purpose of section 265(b)(3) of the Code. The authority represents and covenants as follows: 
(a)  The authority will in no event designate more than $10,000,000.00 of obligations as qualified tax-exempt obligations in calendar year 2004, including the Series 2004A Note, for the purpose of such section 265(b)(3); 
(b)  The authority, all its "subordinate entities," within the meaning of section 265(b)(3) of the Code, and all entities that issue tax-exempt obligations on behalf of the authority and its subordinate entities have together not issued more than $10,000,000.00 of tax-exempt obligations in calendar year 2004 (not including "private activity bonds," within the meaning of section 141 of the Code, other than "qualified 501(c)(3) bonds," within the meaning of section 145 of the Code), including the Series 2004A Note; 
(c)  Barring circumstances unforeseen as of the date of delivery of the Series 2004A Note, the authority will not issue tax-exempt obligations itself or approve the issuance of tax-exempt obligations of any of such other entities if the issuance of such tax-exempt obligations would, when aggregated with all other tax-exempt obligations theretofore issued in calendar year 2004 by the authority and such other entities, result in the authority and such other entities having issued a total of more than $10,000,000.00 of tax-exempt obligations in calendar year 2004 (not including private activity bonds other than qualified 501(c)(3) bonds), including the Series 2004A Note; and 
(d)  The authority has no reason to believe that the authority and such other entities will issue tax-exempt obligations in calendar year 2004 in an aggregate amount that will exceed such $10,000,000.00 limit; 
provided, however, that if the authority receives an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel that compliance with any covenant set forth in [subsection] (a) or (c) above is not required for the Series 2004A Note to be a qualified tax-exempt obligation, the authority need not comply with such covenant. 
9.  The authority appoints Hunton & Williams LLP, Richmond, Virginia, to serve as bond counsel. 
10.  All other acts of the officers of the authority that are in conformity with the purposes and intent of this resolution and in furtherance of the issuance and sale of the notes and the undertaking of the project are hereby approved and ratified. 
11.  This resolution shall take effect immediately.

Prior to adoption of said ordinances, the town and the county each advertised its intention to approve the modified agreement by publishing a notice once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in their respective jurisdictions. The newspaper publication included a descriptive summary of the modified agreement and a statement that a true copy of the modified agreement was on file in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of Bedford County. Prior to adoption of the ordinances, the town council and the board of supervisors each held a public hearing on the modified agreement.
