
			
Preface
The Highland Municipal Code of Highland, Utah, was initially published by the Municipal Code Corporation (Municode). The Code was maintained and updated through November 2016.

In 2017, codification and administration of the Municipal Code began in-house under the direction of the City Recorder, and with the assistance of Municipal Code Online, Inc. This Municipal Code shall be cited as the Highland Municipal Code or “HMC” as an acronym.

This Municipal Code maintains a structure by subject matter using a decimal numbering system identifying the title, chapter, and section (for example: 1.01.010).

The first number in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the Title level
The second series of numbers (1.01.010) designates the Chapter level 
The last series (1.01.010) designates the Section level
If a fourth series exists comprising letters or numbers beyond a section level, it designates a Subsection level. 
This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching the Municipal Code and to assist in subsequent codification as new ordinances are added to the Municipal Code.

To outline, give structure, and more granularly reference the legislation herein, the following list order or pattern of ascending alphanumeric characters is used: A, 1, a, (1), (A), (a). Drafting future legislation with this list order reconciles it with the online code’s list order. To forego the naming of each list item and to more granularly reference legislation that employs alphanumeric characters, use “Part” (always capitalized) followed by the desired alphanumeric reference(s), comma separated. For example, “Part B,7,d”, specifically references item “d”, of item “7”, of item “B”—whereas  “Part B” refers more generally to any or all of Part B’s descendants.

The legislation may also be arranged as an unordered list (using bullets, discs, squares, etc.) to show items without  hierarchical relationships. This numbering system and list structure assists in subsequent codification as new legislation is added.

Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed for future use and may be marked “Reserved” to ease internal expansion. The legislative history identifies the specific legal sources of a section as may be provided in footnotes.

The Municipal Code is supplemented from time-to-time with amendments and additions made by Highland City. The specific legal sources that comprise this Municipal Code have been adapted during the codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies between the online Municipal Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal Code Online, Inc., provides a searchable database of the Municipal Code for easy reference and convenience.

NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MUNICIPAL CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS.

2.28.040 Right Of Public Access
Every person has the right to inspect a public record free of charge and the right to take a copy of a public record during normal working hours, subject to the payment of costs and fees pursuant to Section 2.28.060.
All records are public unless otherwise expressly provided by this chapter or state or federal law or regulation.
The following records are not public:
Records that are appropriately classified private, controlled, or protected as allowed by Sections 2.28.100 through 2.28.120; and
Records to which access is restricted pursuant to court rule, another state statute, federal statute or federal regulation, including records for which access is governed or restricted as a condition of participation in a state or federal program or for receiving state or federal funds.
Only those records specified in Section 2.28.100, 2.28.110 or 2.28.120 may be classified private, controlled or protected.
The city may not disclose a record that is private, controlled, or protected to any person except as provided in subsection (E)(2) of this section or Section 2.28.050.
The city may, at its discretion, disclose records that are private under Section 2.28.100(B) or protected under Section 2.28.120 to persons other than those specified in Section 2.28.050 if the city council, or a designee, determines that there is no interest in restricting access to the record, or that the interests favoring access outweigh the interest favoring restriction of access.
The disclosure of records to which access is governed or limited pursuant to court rule, another state statute, federal statute or federal regulation, including records for which access is governed or limited as a condition of participation in a state or federal program or for receiving state or federal funds, is governed by the specific provisions of that statute, rule or regulation.
This chapter applies to records described in subsection (F)(1) of this section insofar as this chapter is not inconsistent with the statute, rule or regulation.
The city shall provide a person with a certified copy of a record if the person requesting the record:
Has a right to inspect it;
Identifies the record with reasonable specificity; and
Pays the lawful fees.
The city is not required to create a record in response to a request.
Nothing in this chapter requires the city to fulfill a person's records request if the request unreasonably duplicates prior records requests from that person.
If a person requests copies of more than fifty pages of records, and if the records are contained in files that do not contain records that are exempt from disclosure, the city may:
Provide the requester with the facilities for copying the requested records and require that the requester make the copies himself; or
Allow the requester to provide his own copying facilities and personnel to make the copies at the city offices, and waive the fees for copying the records.
If the city owns an intellectual property right and offers the intellectual property right for sale, or license, the city may control by ordinance or policy the duplication and distribution of the material based on terms the city considers to be in the public interest.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the rights or protections granted to the city under federal copyright or patent law as a result of its ownership of the intellectual property right.
The city may not use the physical form, electronic or otherwise, in which a record is stored to deny or unreasonably hinder the rights of persons to inspect and receive copies of a record under this chapter.
HMC (Ord. 1992-4 § 4)

The parent or legal guardian of an unemancipated minor who is the subject of the record;
The legal guardian of a legally incapacitated individual who is the subject of the record;
Any other individual who:
Has a power of attorney from the subject of the record, or

Any person to whom the record must be provided pursuant to court order.
Upon request, the city shall disclose a controlled record to:

Any person to whom a record must be disclosed pursuant to court order.
A person who receives a record from the city in accordance with subsection (B)(1)(a) of this section may not disclose controlled information from that record to any person, including the subject of the record.

Upon request the city shall disclose a protected record to:
The person who submitted the information in the record;
Any other individual who:
Has a power of attorney from all persons, governmental entities or political subdivisions whose interests were sought to be protected by the protected classification or
Submits a notarized release from his legal representatives dated no more than ninety days prior to the date the request is made; or
Any person to whom a record must be provided pursuant to a court order.
The city may disclose a record classified private, controlled or protected to another governmental entity, city, another state, the United States or a foreign government only as provided by Utah Code Annotated, Section 63-2-206.
Before releasing a private, controlled or protected record, the city shall obtain evidence of the requester's identity.
The city shall disclose a record pursuant to the terms of a court order signed by a judge from a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that:
The record deals with a matter in controversy over which the court has jurisdiction;
The court has considered the merits of the request for access to the record; and
The court has considered and, where appropriate, limited the requester's use and further disclosure of the record in order to protect privacy interests in the case of private or controlled records, business confidentiality interests in the case of records protected under Utah Code Section 63-2-304(1) and (2), and privacy interests or the public interest in the case of other protected records;
To the extent the record is properly classified private, controlled or protected, the interests favoring access, considering limitations thereon, outweigh the interests favoring restriction of access; and
Where access is restricted by a rule, statute, or regulation referred to in Section 2.28.040(C)(2), the court has authority independent of this chapter to order disclosure.
The city may disclose or authorize disclosure of private or controlled records for research purposes if the city:
Determines that the research purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished without use of disclosure of the information to the researcher in individually identifiable form;
Determines that the proposed research is bona fide, and that the value of the research outweighs the infringement upon personal privacy;
Requires the researcher to assure the integrity, confidentiality and security of the records and requires the removal or destruction of the individual identifiers associated with the records as soon as the purpose of the research project has been accomplished;
Prohibits the researcher from disclosing the record in individually identifiable form except as provided in subsection (H)(2) of this section, or from using the record for purposes other than the research approved by the city; and
Secures from the researcher a written statement of his understanding of and agreement to the conditions of this subsection and his understanding that violation of the terms of this subsection may subject him to criminal prosecution under Section 63-2-801 of the Utah Code.
A researcher may disclose a record in individually identifiable form if the record is disclosed for the purpose of auditing or evaluating the research program and no subsequent use or disclosure of the record in individually identifiable form will be made by the auditor or evaluator except as provided by this section.
The city may require indemnification as a condition of permitting research under this subsection.
Under Sections 2.28.040(F)(2) and 2.28.160(D) the city may disclose records that are private under Section 2.28.100, or protected under Section 2.28.120, to persons other than those specified in this section.
Under Section 2.28.160 the city council may require the disclosure of records that are private under Section 2.28.100, controlled under Section 2.28.110 or protected under Section 2.28.120 to persons other than those specified in this section.
Under Section 63-2-404(8) of the Utah Code the court may require the disclosure of records that are private under Section 2.28.100, controlled under Section 2.28.110 or protected under Section 2.28.130 to persons other than those specified in this section.

2.28.060 Fees
The city may charge a reasonable fee to cover the city's actual cost of duplicating a record or compiling a record in a form other than that maintained by the city. The fees may be set by resolution. The initial fee, until changed by resolution, is as set forth in Exhibit "A," attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk.
A city may fulfill a record request without charge when it determines that:
Releasing the record primarily benefits the public rather than a person;
The individual requesting the record is the subject of the record; or
The requester's legal rights are directly implicated by the information in the record, and the requester is impecunious.
A city may not charge a fee for:
Reviewing a record to determine whether it is subject to disclosure; or
Inspecting a record.
HMC (Ord. 1992-4 § 6)

2.28.070 Procedures For Access
A person making a request for a record shall furnish the city with a written request containing his name, mailing address, daytime telephone number if available, and a description of the records requested that identifies the record with reasonable specificity.
As soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ten business days after receiving a written request, or five business days after receiving a written request if the requester demonstrates that expedited response to the record request benefits the public rather than the person, the city shall respond to the request by:
Approving the request and providing the record;
Denying the request;
Notifying the requester that it does not maintain the record and providing, if known, the name and address of where the record can be found; or
Notifying the requester that because of one of the extraordinary circumstances listed in subsection D of this section, it cannot immediately approve or deny the request. The notice shall describe the circumstances relied upon and specify the earliest time and date when the records will be available.
Any person who requests a record to obtain information for a story or report for publication or broadcast to the general public is presumed to be acting to benefit the public rather than a person.
The following circumstances constitute "extraordinary circumstances" that allow the city to delay approval or denial by an additional period of time as specified in subsection E of this section if the city determines that due to the extraordinary circumstances it cannot respond within the time limits provided in subsection B of this section:
Another governmental entity is using the record, in which case the city shall promptly request that the governmental entity currently in possession return the record;
Another governmental entity is using the record as part of an audit and returning the record before the completion of the audit would impair the conduct of the audit;
The request is for a voluminous quantity of records;
The city is currently processing a large number of records requests;
The request requires the city to review a large number of records to locate the records requested;
The decision to release a record involves legal issues that require the city to seek legal counsel for the analysis of statutes, rules, ordinances, regulations or case law;
Segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect from information that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires extensive editing; or
Segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect from information that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires computer programming.
If one of the extraordinary circumstances listed in subsection D of this section precludes approval or denial within the time specified in subsection B of this section, the following time limits apply to the extraordinary circumstances:
For claims under subsection (D)(1) of this section, the governmental entity currently in possession of the record shall return the record to the originating entity within five business days of the request for the return unless returning the record would impair the holder's work;
For claims under subsection (D)(2 of this section, the originating city shall notify the requester when the record is available for inspection and copying;
For claims under subsections (D)(3, (D)(4) and (D)(5) of this section, the city shall:
Disclose the records that it has located which the requester is entitled to inspect,
Provide the requester with an estimate of the amount of time it will take to finish the work required to respond to the request, and
Complete the work and disclose those records that the requester is entitled to inspect as soon as reasonably possible;
For delays under Section 2.28.070(D)(6), the city shall either approve or deny the request within five business days after the response time specified for the original request has expired;
For delays under Section 2.28.070(D)(7), the city shall fulfill the request within fifteen business days from the date of the original request; or
For delays under Section 2.28.070(D)(8), the city shall complete its programming and disclose the requested records as soon as reasonably possible.
If the city fails to provide the requested records or issue a denial within the specified time period, that failure is considered the equivalent of a determination denying access to the records.
HMC (Ord. 1992-4 § 7)

2.28.080 Denials
If the city denies the request in whole or part, it shall provide a notice of denial to the requester either in person or by sending the notice to the requester's address.
The notice of denial shall contain the following information:
A description of the record or portions of the record to which access was denied, provided that the description does not disclose private, controlled or protected information or records to which access is restricted pursuant to court rule, another state statute, federal statute or federal regulation, including records for which access is governed or restricted as a condition of participation in a state or federal program or for receiving state or federal funds;
Citations to the provisions of this chapter, another state statute, federal statute, court rule or order or federal regulation that exempt the record or portions of the record from disclosure, provided that the citations do not disclose private, controlled or protected information;
A statement that the requester has the right to appeal the denial to the city council; and
A brief summary of the appeals process, and the time limits for filing an appeal.
Unless otherwise required by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction, the city may not destroy or give up custody of any record to which access was denied until the period for an appeal has expired or the end of the appeals process, including judicial appeal.

2.36.160 Appendix A - Arboricultural Standards And Specifications
Arboricultural Standards and Specifications for Maintenance and Care of City Trees.
The trees on public and private property in Highland City constitute a valued and significant resource that markedly improves the quality of life for all residents and visitors to our city. In order to protect and preserve this valuable public resource Highland City council has established the community tree ordinance with additional arboricultural standards and specifications. 
Highland City Ordinance 1998-21 establishes that it is unlawful to plant, remove, move, spray, trim, prune, top, cut above or below ground, place any harmful substance or material on or around, disturb or alter any tree or shrub on the city parking strips, parks, or any public property, or to cause such acts to be done by others, without first obtaining written consent from Highland City. (Noted exceptions in this document are: planting, pruning and spraying of trees in the parking strip directly in front of the property owner's lot. This is to be done in accordance with Highland City guidelines.) 
Any person receiving written consent shall abide by the arboricultural specifications and standards of practice adopted by Highland City and/or the specific conditions or methods listed by the city. 
In the spirit of preserving and enhancing our community forest, these standards and specifications have been adopted by the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission for the following purposes:
To ensure compliance with, through proper arboricultural care, the existing safety codes of the City of Highland and the State of Utah; 
To reduce and prevent future potential hazards, liabilities and problems from tree breakage or failure; 
To reduce or eliminate damage to sidewalks, curbing or street pavement; 
To enhance the beneficial effects that trees have on our urban environment such as pollution absorption, temperature reduction, and aesthetic contributions to the city; 
To inform property owners of new and existing guidelines for dealing with the street rights-of-way associated with their adjacent property.
The regulations and specifications that follow are intended to support Highland City Ordinance 1998-21. These standards serve as the rules for arboricultural services and activities on public property within the city limits of Highland. Private property owners may also use this document as a guide in the care and maintenance of their privately owned trees.
Areas of Responsibility. 
Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to inform property owners, city crews, commercial tree care companies, etc. the different areas of responsibility regarding trees and their unique circumstances. 
Introduction. The urban forest is made up of many different types of trees. The responsibility for the trees depend on where the tree is located.
Public Trees. All trees located on public property are the responsibility of the Highland City for planting, removal, maintenance, and management. This includes trees in parks, cemeteries, and natural areas. Trees in parking strips shall be planted and maintained by the property owner under the supervision of Highland City.
Trees on Private Property. Trees located on private property are the responsibility of the respective private property owners. If woody vegetation from private property encroaches into the public right-of-way and/or in any way causes unsafe passage, Highland City may address the problem as a public nuisance. An exception would be where private trees are growing into utility lines. 
Power Line Clearance. Utah Power & Light is responsible for providing private and public trees with adequate clearance from U.P. & L. power lines. No other workers or persons are authorized to approach or attempt to clear branches or vegetation from the power system. 
General Requirements. 
Purpose. This standard is intended to guide city crews, private property owners and contractors in the general requirements regarding regulation and maintenance of city-owned and managed trees in compliance with Highland City Ordinance 1998-21 to provide uniform and consistent management of the resource. 
Introduction. These guidelines are to serve as a standard for all plantings and treatments of city-owned trees. They will apply whether work is performed contractually, by city forces, or by private individuals. Highland City arboricultural standards and specifications shall be adhered to at all times, but may be amended by the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission at any time that experience, new research, or laws indicate improved methods, or whenever circumstances make it advisable. Exceptions to the standards and specifications must be by written approval by the city forester. 
Public Requirements. Trees shall be maintained in such a manner as not to endanger, interfere, or otherwise conflict with requirements of safe public use of an area. City tree maintenance crews perform work by schedule and not in response to individual calls (except in emergencies). When a homeowner wishes to prune, spray, cut roots or remove a street tree, consent must be obtained from the city forester. 
Private and Business for Fee Requirements. Written consent is required and must be obtained from the city forester before any person, either for himself or another, plants, prunes, removes or treats any tree, shrub or hedge in or on public right-of-way, street or other public place. Coordination with the city forester shall be required of any public utility, their agents and contractors engaged in activities which affect city-owned trees, and these arboricultural practices must be followed.
General Standards of Conduct. 
Authorization for work on public trees neither express nor imply a right to violate any law of the land while in the process of performing such work. 
All work on trees shall be performed according to the latest revision of the following national standards:
A.N.S.I. A300 Tree Care Operations—Tree, Shrub and Other Woody Plant Maintenance—Standard Practices. 
Tree Care Operations Standard A.N.S.I Z-133.1, Pruning, Trimming, Repairing Maintaining and Removing Trees, and Cuffing Brush—Safety Requirements. 
I.S.A. Tree Pruning Guidelines. 
A qualified supervisor shall be present at all times when work is being performed on any city-owned tree. Inadequate or improperly trained personnel shall not be utilized for work on trees beyond their known capacity or ability. 
Any injury to persons or damages to any improvement, vehicle, tree, shrub, or structure while working with trees or shrubs shall be promptly reported to the city forester and arrangements made to properly make restitution or repair within a reasonable period of time. 
All debris generated from any tree maintenance operation shall be removed promptly. The work area shall be kept safe at all times until all clean-up is completed.
Work on an arterial or collector street shall not be performed during times of high traffic or rush hour periods without prior approval from Highland City. 
Use of tools or equipment in unsafe condition or any application of techniques or methods deemed unsafe to life, limb, or property is forbidden. 
Pedestrian and vehicular traffic shall be allowed to pass through work areas only under conditions of safety and with as little inconvenience and delay as possible.
Street and sidewalk warning devices shall be used as required by state and city law at all times while work on public trees or shrubs is being performed. Adequate barricades and warning devices shall be placed and flagmen shall be stationed as necessary for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. Highland City may be consulted for appropriate set up of these warning devices. 
Utility poles, fire hydrants and other structures shall not be tied to with winch trucks in the process of removing trees, or for the purpose of securing anchorage or leverage while removing trees or portions thereof. 
Whenever electric, telephone, gas, water, cable or any other lines or improvements are jeopardized by a tree or shrub activity, the proper authorities or property owners shall be consulted prior to performing any work. 
Street Tree Spacing and Location Requirements. 
Purpose. This standard is intended to serve as a guide in the correct placement of shade trees in parking strips, parks and other Highland City property in compliance with Highland City Ordinance 1998-21, in order to provide for public safety and other requirements. 
Introduction. Public safety is a major concern. The purpose of this section is to eliminate future problems such as corner sight obstructions, traffic signs, damage to sidewalks and streets, interference to overhead and underground utility lines, etc. 
General Guidelines. 
Improperly placed trees cause significant damage to city sidewalks, streets, curbs and buildings. These trees often become liabilities to the city and require premature removal. An official tree list has been prepared called the "Street Tree Selection Guide" to aid in the planting of shade trees along city rights-of-way.
According to the guide, trees which attain a large size at maturity must only be planted in parking strips with a minimum width of ten feet and spaced at least forty-five feet apart. Those trees classified as medium-size must be planted in six foot minimum width parking strips and spaced at thirty-five feet apart. Small-sized trees may be planted in parking strips with a minimum width of four feet and spaced twenty feet apart. All newly planted street trees shall be planted in the middle of the parking strip.
No trees or woody plants shall be planted in parking strips where a space of less than three and one-half feet in width exists between the curb and the detached sidewalk without the approval of the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission.
No public or private tree shall be planted in such a manner that eventual growth cannot be reasonably maintained so as to avert interference with, or obstruction to, any improvements installed for the public benefit such as traffic and street signs and lights, fire hydrants, overhead utility wires, street lights, utility poles, etc. 
Unauthorized plantings or volunteer growth occurring in a planting strip may be ordered removed by the city forester.
Additional Location Requirements: 
Seven feet from a driveway or alley;
Twenty feet from a street light or street sign;
Fifteen feet from any utility pole; 
Ten feet from a fire hydrant; 
Five feet from the city's anticipated future sidewalk location, shall be the setback where no sidewalk exists. 
When a tree exists near the potential placement of street signs, pedestrian lights, etc., the sign location shall be evaluated as to lessen conflict with the growth of the existing tree.
Where a combination sidewalk-curb and gutter have been installed, no tree plantings are to be made closer than five feet from the edge of any concrete installation.
Sidewalk concrete planters must have a minimum planting area of at least sixteen square feet and larger if possible.
At the intersection of roadways, no plant material with a mature height greater than thirty-six inches shall be planted within a sight triangle measuring twenty-five feet along the boundary of each of the intersecting curb lines, except where engineering standards indicate otherwise. No tree shall be planted in such a location that it would create a conflict with sight obstacle triangle.

The clear vision area is maintained to provide an adequate field of vision for motorists and pedestrians at road intersections. 
Additional Guidelines for New Residential Development. The guidelines for new residential development are included in the Highland City packet called "Subdivision Review and Approval Process and Application Forms." These include specific requirements regarding spacing, size, planting and bonding. The Highland "Tree Selection Guide" lists approved tree varieties. Subdivision landscape plans shall be reviewed by the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission before being submitted for approval.
Additional Guidelines for Commercial Development. 
Number. Deciduous shade trees shall be planted by the developer on both sides of streets, in landscaped common areas, and cul-de-sac islands. These trees shall be planted at a ratio of one per thirty feet, either lining the streets, or in groupings on the lot. These trees shall generally be located between the sidewalk or foot path and the edge of the street, within a planting strip no less than five feet in width. 
Size. The trees shall be of two inch caliper, measured at four inches above the root graft (or equivalent with the approval of the planning commission). 
Type. The type of tree shall be as per Highland "Tree Selection Guide", (or with review of the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission, and approval of the planning commission).
Planting Options. 
The developer shall bond with the city for an amount equaling the total value of the trees in the development, prior to the recording of the final plat. The city forester shall procure, schedule and supervise the planting of the trees according to the landscape plan submitted by the developer on a lot-to-lot basis after each home is occupied. The trees shall be maintained by the homeowner in accordance with Highland City Tree Ordinance 1998-21; or 
If the developer wishes to plant the trees himself to enhance his development and help sell lots, he may do so. He shall install a sprinkling system and maintain the trees. He will be bonded for fifty percent of the value of the trees which shall be released to him at the end of two years if the trees are thriving. 
Approval. Location of all required landscape trees must be included in the final plat. Landscape plans shall be reviewed by the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission for adherence to Highland City Ordinance 1998-21 and the arboricultural standards and specifications appendix (Section 2.36.160) before final plat approval.
Tree Planting.
Purpose. This standard is intended to guide city crews and private contractors in the correct planting of shade trees in parking strips, parks and other city property in compliance with Highland City Ordinance 1998-21. 
Introduction. Proper tree planting gets the tree off to a good start, and eliminates future problems such as root rot, etc. 
Nursery Stock Specifications. 
Newly planted public trees must be a minimum caliper size of two inches in diameter, measured four inches above the root collar or flare.
Plant material shall conform with procurement, transport and installation guidelines established by the International Society of Arboriculture and the "American Standards for Nursery Stock" published by the American Nurseryman's Association.
Plants shall have normal, well developed branches and vigorous root systems. Plants shall not be root-bound. They shall be healthy, vigorous plants free from defects, decay, sun scald injuries, abrasions of the bark, insect pests and all forms of infestations or objectionable disfigurements. 
Balled and burlapped plants shall be dug with solid balls of adequate size, the balls securely wrapped with burlap or canvas, tightly bound with rope or twine.
The city forester may inspect and/or reject any tree or shrub before it is planted in a city right-of-way or other city property.
General Planting Standards. 
No species other than those included in the "Street Tree Selection Guide" may be planted as street trees without written permission of the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission. The planting of spreading or nuisance species which grow out and over designated pedestrian or vehicular rights-of-way, thereby obstructing it, are not permitted. 
Private projects shall provide for street tree planting as part of the development process. Street trees located on the public rights-of-way shall adhere to the design objectives and spacing and location requirements found in the zoning ordinances and this document. 
Existing public properties shall receive new fill in plantings on an ongoing basis. Removed trees shall be replaced with one or more new trees when space allows for it. 
Highland City requires landscape designs using trees in patterns (formal or informal) along city streets. However, efforts shall be made to insure that no single tree species makes up more than fifteen percent of the total street tree population. This is to reduce susceptibility to uniform disease and eventual uniform tree decline or death. 
Planting Standards of Workmanship.
Plant material should be handled to allow the least amount of damage during planting. 
Balled, burlapped and container grown plants shall always be handled by the soil ball as to minimize root and trunk damage, and separation. Under no circumstances should they be dragged, pulled, or lifted by the trunk or foliage parts in a manner that would loosen the roots in the ball.
Tree roots should be handled and secured as to minimize damage from wind and desiccation. If a tree or trees are not to be planted the same day they are set at the site, they should be watered, covered, and stored in the shade to protect them from dehydration. Bare-root stock shall never be left open to air except from the point of uncovering the roots to plant the tree. 
Any broken limbs caused in the planting operation should be pruned immediately. In cases where trees are prone to damage during planting operations, trees should be properly protected. 
Excavated plant pits shall not be left open for any extended period of time. When work is not in progress, each hole shall be adequately barricaded with warning devices to prevent injury or public hazard.
Appropriate clean up of soil, branches, twine, rope, wire, or other debris resulting from any tree or shrub planting shall be promptly accomplished. The work area shall be kept safe at all times until the clean up operation is completed. Under no circumstances shall debris remain as to cause a public hazard.
Planting Procedures. 
Layout. Locations shall be checked for underground utilities prior to any excavation. Where below ground obstructions are encountered, the tree planting locations shall be modified accordingly. 
Planting Holes. Holes shall be dug with a diameter at least twice the size as the diameter of the ball (or root spread) of the tree. It is recommended that trees be planted two inches higher than grade to allow for settling. 
Removal of Binding Material. All wires, twine, baskets, and other binding materials shall be cut and removed prior to backfilling, unless otherwise recommended by the nursery. When setting trees, burlap shall be pulled back from the top of the ball and cut away as close to the bottom of the ball as is possible. 
Watering In. No backfill soil shall be placed on top of the root-ball. Each planted tree must be watered in. Watering helps settle the root-ball into the surrounding soil. 
Staking. Typically, trees do not require staking. However, circumstances sometimes require additional support to help the tree become established. If it is necessary, use two stakes of sufficient diameter which should be located approximately at the edge of the root ball. The tree stem shall be attached to the stakes by means of a wide band of fabric material. Material shall not be of any type that may constrict natural expansion of the stem. Stakes shall be removed by the following growing season. 
Mulching. All trees shall have a mulched area with a minimum diameter of three feet in order to protect the tree from damage caused by lawn mowers or trimmers. All mulch shall be kept away from the base of the tree so as not to induce rot, disease, and insect problems. No flowers or other vegetation shall be planted around newly planted trees. Mulch should be re-applied as necessary to maintain a three inch thick layer.

Tree Pruning and Removal.
Purpose. This standard is intended to guide city crews and private contractors in the pruning and removal of city-owned trees in parking strips, parks and other Highland City property in compliance with Highland City Ordinance 1998-21. 
General Standards for Tree Pruning. 
All tree maintenance work on public trees shall be performed in accordance with the latest revisions of ANSI A300 and ANSI Z133.1 Standards. Copies of these national standards are available for review at the Highland City Office. 
All public deciduous trees on improved properties should be pruned on a rotational basis of not more than five years. 
Any public tree which, because of habit of growth, age, condition or disease, becomes a public nuisance or a hazard to public safety or obstructs a clear view of streets, signs, signals or an intersection, shall be maintained in a manner that corrects the problem. 
Hanging limb and branch growth shall be maintained thirteen feet above streets and eight feet above sidewalks.
Property owners are responsible for pruning their private trees from obstructing public rights-of-way and to the minimum height clearance required by city ordinance and this document. All line clearance around power lines shall be performed by U.P. & L. 
Authority to prune street trees does not include the cutting back of sound, healthy tree branches which are in excess of six inches diameter, unless specifically prescribed by the city forester or if required by accepted arboricultural standards in the course of utility line clearance work and is coordinated with the city forester. 
Tree branches shall be removed and controlled in such a manner as not to cause damage to other parts of the tree, other plants, and property. 
Clean-up of branches, logs or any other debris resulting from a tree pruning or removing shall be promptly and properly accomplished. The work area shall be kept safe at all times until the clean-up operation is completed. Under no condition shall the accumulation of brush, branches, logs, or other debris be allowed upon a public property in such a manner as to cause a public hazard. 
The use of climbing spurs or gaffs shall be permitted only in the case of tree removals or in aerial rescue emergencies.
Under no conditions shall it be considered proper to leave severed or partially cut limbs in a tree after the workers leave the scene of operations. 
Tree Removal Standards. Street or park trees may be removed if: 
The tree interferes with or creates a public nuisance or hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic, and cannot be properly maintained to remove such hazard, or is considered a public nuisance by the city forester; 
The tree severely interferes with the growth and development of a more desirable tree; 
The tree's aesthetic value is so low, that the site would be enhanced visually by its removal;
The tree has been topped, thus producing an unsound branching structure conducive to severe storm damage, windthrow, and accelerated death; 
The tree is not approved for planting in parking strips. 
Stump Removal Requirements and Standards.
Persons performing stump removal duties shall have the immediate area investigated for utility lines and blue-stake as necessary, and wear all required safety eye and ear protection. 
All removal of public trees shall be done in a manner so that the remaining stump will be at least twelve inches below ground level unless special exemption is granted be the city forester. 
Excavation resulting from a tree or shrub removal must be promptly filled in to normal ground level with clean earth; the fill properly settled and free of debris.
Tree Protection and Preservation. 
Purpose. This standard is intended to guide city crews and private contractors in the protection of city-owned trees near construction, public works or underground utility projects in compliance with Highland City Ordinance 1998-21. 
Introduction. The condition of a tree is an important factor in appraising a tree for its monetary value. All people that work around trees are responsible to protect them from unnecessary injury that would decrease their value. Remember that tree roots spread two to eight times wider than the drip-line of the canopy and that ninety percent of a tree's roots are found in the top two feet of soil. These facts illustrate why it is so important to use care when working around city trees. 
General Standards. 
Trees shall not be used to support any scaffolding, signs, temporary utility, or any other device.
When grade change is required, a retaining wall or dry well for drainage must be established at existing grade. 
Sidewalks and paving levels should be contoured whenever possible to avoid root cuffing. 
Any alterations to development plans that take place during the construction phase which impact trees must be coordinated with the city forester.
Irrigation of the tree during construction and other pertinent issues must be addressed prior to the beginning of the construction phase.
If damage occurs to a protected tree, immediate contact shall be made with the city forester in order that wounds can be treated. 
Tree Protection Zone. 
Trees to be preserved during construction activities shall have a tree protection zone ("T.P.Z.") clearly marked with a continuous protective fence prior to any demolition, stripping or clearing.
Heavy equipment shall not be allowed inside the protected area. All excavations shall be made by equipment from outside of the T.P.Z.
Building materials, topsoil, or fill shall not be stockpiled in the T.P.Z. or in the dripline of any tree that is scheduled to remain at a construction site.

Prior to construction on public property, the T.P.Z. will be designated by the city forester following coordination with other city departments. The size and shape of the T.P.Z. will depend on the species sensitivity to impact, health and age of the tree, root and crown conformation and development constraints. 
Underground Utility Work. 
Trenching should be performed in a manner and location least damaging to tree roots.
Tunneling or boring should be done whenever possible. Where large scaffold roots are encountered, hand digging and bridging of roots shall be done. 
Any cutting of tree roots, other than when in the process of tree removal, shall give due consideration to future welfare of the tree. Proper action shall be taken as to protect, preserve, or correct the root problem. 
"Trenching and Tunneling Near Trees" by the National Arbor Day Foundation shall be used as a guide for all construction and excavation work around city trees. This booklet may be obtained from the city forester. 
Excavation involving root cuts should be done rapidly. Cuts on tree roots shall be smooth, and clean. Backfill before the roots have a chance to dry out, and water tree immediately. If tree roots are to remain out for any extended period of time, they must be covered with burlap and kept moist at all times. 
Spray Applications.
Anyone applying pesticides on street or park trees must have a current commercial or noncommercial pesticide applicator's license and shall observe all safety requirements pertaining to licensed pesticide applicators including EPA and the State of Utah regulations for the application of pesticides. The property owner may spray park strip trees himself only under the guidance of Highland City. 
Ineffectual control, damage, injury, or death of plants, animals, or persons resulting from the use of materials beyond the limitations of the manufacturer's guarantee shall be considered the responsibility of the applicator. 
If a spray machine is not capable of giving proper spray coverage to all portions of the infested or partially infested tree being treated, it shall be considered inadequate to perform such operation.
Spray equipment shall be kept clean and in good working order.
Operation with dirty tanks or equipment or unsanitary, unsafe, methods of washing out or draining of same in public sewers and gutters is prohibited.
No spray application shall be carried out when the temperature is outside the range of forty to eighty-eight degrees Fahrenheit or when the wind velocity is greater than six mph. 
All spray machines other than hand-pump sprayers must have agitators capable of maintaining a uniform spray suspension at all times when spray application is in progress. 
Adequate precautions shall be taken in all phases of spray application concerning factors of toxicity, phytotoxicity, chemical reaction, or residual action pertaining to spray material used.
Applicators applying pesticides to trees shall adhere to all state and federal regulations pertaining to pesticides and the safe and unobstructed passage of vehicles and pedestrians.
Applying fertilizers and pesticides for pay is considered as commercial pesticide applications and does require a current license for such from the Utah State Department of Agriculture.
Highland City Street Tree Selection Guide. 
Trees are a valuable component of our city. Trees clean the air we breath, muffle city noise, harbor wildlife in their canopies, cool houses with their dense shade, and increase property values. But perhaps most of all, trees provide a natural beauty which softens the harsh city landscape. Trees truly enhance the quality of life for all. 
Unfortunately not all trees are properly planted and cared for. Growth characteristics including height, spread, and branching structure limit the usefulness of some trees in certain locations. Streets, buildings, and sidewalks also limit the space available for tree growth and must be considered when selecting a tree. Our goal should be to choose a tree that is well matched to the planting site so that it survives and becomes an asset to the community. 
The trees in this guide are generally tolerant of local temperature extremes (hardiness) and have characteristics that make them useful as street trees. All of the trees have been divided into classes dependent on the width, height, and spacing requirements that the trees will need at maturity. These divisions are described as follows: 
Class I. These are small trees which normally do not reach a large height or trunk diameter. They can be planted beneath power lines and in parking strips down to four feet wide. Typical spacing between Class I trees is twenty to thirty feet. 
Class II. These trees are usually considered medium sized trees and are normally planted for their shade and aesthetic contribution. These trees are not for planting under power lines or in parking strips less than six feet wide. Typical spacing between Class II trees is thirty to forty feet. 
Class III. Many of these trees are long-lived and attain large height and trunk diameter. When selecting a tree from this class, be sure you have ample room to accommodate it at maturity. These trees are not for planting under power lines or parking strips less than ten feet wide. Typical spacing between Class III trees is forty to sixty feet. 
How to Select a Tree. Shade trees vary greatly in their growth characteristics. Many trees are wider than they are tall. Learning about a tree's shape, mature height, and spread will help in selecting the right tree for the right place. The idea is to first consider the planting site. Does the location have adequate irrigation? Are there any overhead wires? How wide is the parking strip? Once the location has been considered, it is then time to choose a tree from the list that will best fit the location. 
Each tree in the guide is listed with its common and botanical names followed by a short narrative with general information. Additional information is given about each tree in the following categories: 
"Growth rate" is a general estimate of the relative growth of trees as well as the life-span of the tree species. 
"Commonly available varieties" discusses the varieties that work well in this area and that are recommended.
"Where to see" describes the location of examples that are growing within the city. It is recommended that trees be visited prior to planting so that you can see the tree at its mature size and get an idea as to what the tree will require in maintenance and growing space. 

How to Plant a Tree

The best way to insure a healthy and safe street tree is to start by planting the tree correctly. There are only a few things to remember when planting. The following are some planting tips that will help the tree off to a good start:
Always pick up a tree by the container or root ball, not by the trunk. 
The hole should be dug as deep as the root ball and twice as wide. Digging the hole in this way will loosen soil so roots can grow. 
Only remove broken or dead branches. 
Do not apply fertilizer when planting: it may burn tender roots.
Water trees at least once a week, and more frequently during hot weather. 
Where to Plant a Tree.
If you wish to plant a tree in a parking strip, you are required to get consent from the city forester. This is done to insure that trees have been matched to the site correctly and in order to schedule future maintenance by city pruning crews. Once a tree is planted in a city-owned parking strip, it becomes city property. Pruning and other major maintenance of these trees is the responsibility of the parks and recreation department.
When planting a tree place plant the tree in the middle of the parking strip, away from any known utility lines. This will allow the maximum amount of growing space and will reduce the potential for damage in the future.
What Not to Plant. There are some types of trees that have characteristics that are not suited to areas close to sidewalks, buildings, and streets. These tree species are most suited for yards, parks, or other natural areas and should not be planted along city streets. A list of trees not approved for planting along streets is found at the end of this guide. To obtain additional information about services provided by the urban forestry division or planting trees, please call the urban forestry office.
As new information becomes available the "Tree Selection Guide" may be changed by the community Parks, Trails, and Tree Commission without the approval of the Highland planning commission or city council.

2.40.010 Policy Considerations
There is an underlying policy in the city, strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending law suits alleging such issues. At the same time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the public's right to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the Constitution. Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist governments in considering decisions that may involve constitutional takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This chapter is further intended and shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet preserve the ability of the city to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its other duties and functions.

HMC (Ord. 1995-9 § 2(I))
2.40.020 Definitions
The following terms are defined in this section:

"Constitutional taking" means actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property that might require compensation to a private real property owner because of:
The Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
Article I, Section 22, of the Utah Constitution;
Any court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of private real property by a government entity.
Actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property is not a constitutional taking if the physical taking or exaction;
Bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest; and
Is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an individualized property basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development on the legitimate government interest.

The city shall have the authority to sell, lease, convey and dispose of personal public property for the benefit of the city as provided by Utah Code Annotated Section 10-8-2, as amended.
All surplus property is disposed of “as is” with no warranty, guarantee, or representation of any kind, expressed or implied, as to the condition, utility or usability of the property offered.
General Procedures for Disposal of Personal Public Property:
The City Administrator shall be responsible for the coordination and disposal of personal public property.  
Each department head shall identify assets for disposal by completing an "Asset Disposal" sheet (Appendix A [2]) and determining the market value of the asset taking into account the replacement cost and depreciation rate for the item.
Computer and electronic data storage equipment shall have the data wiped prior to disposal.  This includes, but is not limited to, computers, laptops, tablets, servers, backup tapes and media switches, routers and hubs, phones, printers, fax machines, copiers, scanners, monitors, and external hard drives.  For servers, backup media, or any equipment in which data wiping is not feasible, staff will physically remove the data storage components for destruction of the data or configuration by physical or other permanent means.
The finance director shall:
Validate the inventory control number or fixed asset schedule item;
Remove the item from the inventory control list or fixed asset schedule; and
Direct the city recorder to remove the item from any maintenance agreements.
Maintain an inventory of surplused items with the name of the purchaser and value obtained through disposal, if any.
Notify or email the City Council a report of all surplused items upon completion of the transactions. 
The City Administrator shall select the best disposal option. Sale of the item, rather than donation, is preferred when significant value is determined. Appropriate methods of disposal are as follows:
Auction. Surplus property may be sold at public auction. Auctions may be conducted by City staff, or the City may contract with a professional auctioneer or electronic auction site.
Sealed Bids. Sealed bids may be solicited for the sale of surplus property. Surplus property disposed of in this manner shall be sold to the highest responsible bidder.
Selling for Scrap. Surplus property may be sold as scrap if the City deems that the value of its parts exceeds the value of the surplus property as a whole.
Negotiation with Interested Buyer.  When the City is aware of an interested buyer and deems that it can obtain market value for the surplus property from that buyer, it may dispose of the property through a negotiated transaction. 
Donation. Surplus property may be donated to any other public agency or charitable organization exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
No Value Item. Where the City determines that property is surplus and of minimal value to the City due to spoilage, obsolescence or other cause or where the City determines that the cost of disposal of such property would exceed the recovery value, the City shall dispose of the same in such a manner as they deem appropriate and in the best interest of the City.
For property valued over $300.00, reasonable notice shall be given to the public prior to disposal.  "Reasonable notice" shall mean publishing a notice of the proposed disposition of personal public property, (1) on the city website after the items have been declared surplus and at least fourteen days prior to the disposition.
The city council shall authorize by Resolution the surplusing of all personal public property valued at over $300.00.
Property valued below $300.00 may be disposed of by the City Administrator pursuant to these policies.  If the surplus personal public property item(s) is/are deemed to have no economic value, it shall be disposed of through donation to charitable organization, or through destruction.
Employees and city officials may bid on surplused property provided they do not take any action for their personal interest or gain that improperly gives them any advantage or benefit, or in aid of others doing the same.

HMC (Ord. 1990-3 § 1)
3.04.020 Purpose
The forty-eighth session of the Utah Legislature of Utah has authorized the counties and municipalities of the State of Utah to enact sales and use tax ordinances imposing a one percent tax.
It is the purpose of this chapter to conform the sales and use tax of the municipality to the requirements of the Sales and Use Tax Act, Chapter 12 of Title 59, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as currently amended.

From and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, there is levied and there shall be collected and paid a tax upon every retail sale of tangible personal property, services and meals made within the municipality at the rate of one percent.
An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in this municipality of tangible personal property from any retailer on or after the operative date of the ordinance codified in this chapter at the rate of one percent of the sales price of the property.
For the purpose of this chapter all retail sales shall be presumed to have been consummated at the place of business delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under the rules and regulations prescribed by and adopted by the State Tax Commission. Public utilities as defined by Title 54, Utah Code Annotated 1953, shall not be obligated to determine the place or places within any county or municipality where public utilities services are rendered, but the place of sale or the sales tax revenue arising from such service allocable to the city shall be as determined by the State Tax Commission pursuant to an appropriate formula and other rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by it.
Except as hereinafter provided, and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Act, all of the provisions of Chapter 12, Title 59, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, and in force and effect on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, insofar as they relate to sales taxes, excepting Sections 59-12-101 and 59-12-119 thereof, are adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein.
Wherever, and to the extent that in Chapter 12 of Title 59, Utah Code Annotated 1953, the State of Utah is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this municipality shall be substituted therefor. Nothing in this subsection B shall be deemed to require substitution of the name of the municipality for the word "state" when that word is used as part of the title of the State Tax Commission, or of the Constitution of the State of Utah, nor shall the name of the municipality be substituted for that of the state in any section when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the municipality or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Tax Commission in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.
If an annual license has been issued to a retailer under Section 59-12-106 of the Utah Code Annotated 1953, an additional license shall not be required by reason of this section.
There shall be excluded from the purchase price paid or unchanged by which the tax is measured:
The amount of any sales or use tax imposed by the State of Utah upon a retailer of consumer;
The gross receipts from the sale of or the cost of storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property upon which a sales or use tax has become due by reason of the sale transaction to any other municipality and any county in the State of Utah, under the sales or use tax ordinance enacted by that county or municipality in accordance with the Sales and Use Tax Act.
HMC (Ord. 1990-3 § 4)

3.04.050 Violation; Penalties
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine in an amount less than three hundred dollars or imprisonment for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

Requirement to Maintain Electronic Database or Enhanced Zip Code Listing.
Electronic Database.
Provision of Database. The state may provide an electronic database to a home service provider; or, if the state does not provide such an electronic database, the designated database provider may choose to provide an electronic database to a home service provider.
Format:
Such electronic database, whether provided by the state or the designated database provider, shall be provided in a format approved by the American National Standards Institute's Accredited Standards Committee X12, which, allowing for de minimis deviations, designates for each street address in the city, including, to the extent practicable, any multiple postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, and the appropriate code identified by one nationwide standard numeric code.
Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code for each street address with respect to political subdivisions that are not taxing jurisdictions when reasonably needed to determine the proper taxing jurisdiction.
The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the same number of numeric digits, with each digit or combination of digits referring to the same level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States, using a format similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission or their successors. Each address shall be provided in standard postal format.
Notice—Updates. The state or designated database provider that provides or maintains an electronic database described above shall provide notice of the availability of the then-current electronic database and any subsequent revisions thereof, by publication in the manner normally employed for the publication of informational tax, charge, or fee notices to taxpayers in such state.
User Held Harmless. A home service provider using the data contained in an electronic database described above shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of any error or omission in such database provided by the city or designated database provider. The home service provider shall reflect changes made to such database during a calendar quarter, not later than thirty days after the end of such calendar quarter the state has issued notice of the availability of an electronic database reflecting such changes under the "Notice-Updates" subsection above.
Procedure If No Electronic Database Provided.
Safe Harbor. If neither the state nor the designated database provider provides an electronic database, a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in the city that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to all incorrect taxing jurisdiction, if the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code. Any enhanced zip code assignment changed is deemed to be in compliance with this section. For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if the home service provider demonstrates that it has:
Expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;
Implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions; and
Used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such database.
Termination of Safe Harbor. The "Safe Harbor" subsection above applies to a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of the "Safe Harbor" subsection with respect to a state for which an electronic database is not provided, until the later of:
Eighteen months after the nationwide standard numeric code has been approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission; or
Six months after the state or a designated database provider in the state provides such database.
Place of Primary Use.
A home service provider is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the customer's place of primary use. Subject to subsection D above, and if the home service provider's reliance on information by its customer is in good faith, a home service provider:
May rely upon the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider's customer.
Is not liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges, or fees that are customarily passed on to the customer as a separate address under existing agreements.
A home service provider may treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect two years after the date of this amendment to this ordinance as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdiction to which taxes, charges, or fees on charges for mobile telecommunication services are remitted.
Tax Against Customer. Each customer shall accurately report the customer's place of primary use. The customer shall be liable for any taxes not paid by the home service provider as a result of the customer's failure to accurately report the customer's place of primary use.
Nonapplication. This ordinance does not apply to the determination of the taxing situs of:
Prepaid telephone calling services; or
Air-ground radiotelephone service, as defined in section 22.99 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations as in effect on June 1, 1999.
Implementation Date. If this ordinance is adopted before January 1, 2001, a home service provider shall have a minimum of thirty days' notice before being obligated to collect the tax described in the ordinance. After January 1, 2001, a home service provider shall have a minimum of sixty days' notice before being obligated to collect the tax described in this ordinance. After January 1, 2001, a home service provider shall receive a minimum of sixty days' notice regarding any changes to this ordinance.

Based on the collective experiences of city officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by door-to-door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door-to-door solicitation, the city adopts this chapter to promote the city's substantial interests in:

Respecting citizen's decisions regarding privacy in their residences;
Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
Permitting truthful and non-misleading door-to-door solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
The city finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the city interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated.

A permit shall be obtained for each such animal or wild animal establishment from the city; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to parks, zoos, pet shops, medical or scientific institutions or other places licensed for the showing or keeping of wild animals or reptiles.
Every individual controlling or maintaining such animals or wild animal establishment shall quarantine said animals as provided for in Section 6.16.030 of this title for ninety days. These animals shall be vaccinated for rabies by a qualified veterinarian using a suitable vaccine for the species as approved by the state veterinarian.
All such wild animals or reptiles referred to in subsection (C)(2) of this section shall be kept under proper confinement on the premises and shall not be allowed to run at large and shall be maintained on the premises or private property of the owner in such a manner as to not endanger life or limb of any person lawfully entering such premises.

8.16.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to define and designate what is a nuisance and to regulate the abatement of such nuisances within the city. Although this chapter outlines the policy and procedure to be followed by city officials in controlling nuisances, it does not preclude the notion that Highland City is made up of people with diverse lifestyles and that the city council must retain the authority to make exceptions to this chapter in reasonable cases and encourage a spirit of tolerance and cooperation between neighbors.

HMC (Ord. 1995-6 § 1(part))
8.16.020 Remedies
A civil action to abate or enjoin a nuisance, or for damages for causing or maintaining a nuisance (including the cost, if any, of cleaning the subject property), may be brought by Highland City or by any private person directly affected.

The city may elect to pursue either civil or criminal remedies or both to enforce this chapter.
The city shall retain the option of providing allowances as it deems prudent and fair to owners or occupants who may be in noncompliance of this chapter at the time of its passage into law.

Inspection Procedure.
Upon written complaint by any citizen of the city, the inspector shall inspect real property situated within the city for the purpose of determining whether or not it contains a nuisance as defined by this chapter.
Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the inspector or his authorized representative has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition subject to abatement hereunder, the inspector or his authorized representative may enter such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any other duty imposed by this chapter; provided, that, if such building or premises be occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and request entry, and if such building or premises be unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge of the building or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the inspector or his authorized representative shall have the recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
The city shall keep confidential the identity of the person submitting the complaint, unless otherwise directed by the complainant.

In the event that the inspector shall choose to proceed under Section 8.16.090 (Collection of abatement costs), he shall make a proof of service of such notice under oath and file the same in the office of the county treasurer. One notice shall be deemed sufficient on any lot or parcel of property for one full year.

In response to the proliferation of alarm systems and the city council's concern for the public's best interest from a safety standpoint as it relates to the increased incidents of false alarms, it is necessary that rules and regulations be adopted to control the licensing and operation of alarm systems businesses and the establishment of a process whereby the city can recoup the expenses incurred in responding to false alarms.

12.16.100 Special Regulations
Buffer Distances.
No extractive operations, machinery, equipment and stockpiles (excluding rock crushing) shall take place within one hundred feet horizontal distance of any property owned by another individual or entity permitted by the city council, but in no event shall the operation be closer than twenty feet to the property line.
No rock-crushing operations shall be conducted within four hundred feet horizontal distance of any other property owner, except as may be permitted by the city council, but in no event shall the operation be closer than fifty feet to the property line.
No excavations shall be conducted within one hundred feet of a public road except where permitted by the city council upon determination that the excavations will not endanger the users of the road.
Fencing. Areas of excavation creating serious or hazardous conditions shall be fenced, except where in the determination of the planning commission other suitable devices may be used instead.
Grade. All grading for slope stabilization shall be done in accordance with the current reclamation plans, with the concurrence of the city engineer.
Air and Water Quality. All air-and-water-quality-related plans and actions may be monitored and shall be subject to approval by the Utah County environmental health division.
Hours. Crushing and screening, except for the maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment, shall be confined to the hours between six a.m. and seven p.m., Monday through Saturday.
Landscaping. Properties containing uses for which a natural resources excavation permit is required shall be landscaped for the purpose of screening such uses from public streets abutting properties not in a natural resource zone. Vegetative materials shall be planted together with necessary top soil used in accordance with the schedule approved in the granting of the natural resources permit and shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition.
Noise and Vibration. All equipment on-site and off-site utilized in the extraction and processing of native natural resources shall be operated and maintained so as to minimize the emanation of noise and vibration from the premises.
Roads.

HMC (Ord. 1979-18 § XI)

12.16.110 Reclamation
The objectives of excavation reclamation shall be:
To return the land, concurrently with the mining operation or within a reasonable amount of time thereafter to a predetermined condition defined by the reclamation plan as submitted and approved, compatible with past, present or probable future local land uses;
To minimize or prevent present and future on-site or off-site environmental degradations to the ecologic and hydrologic regimes caused by mining operations, and to meet other pertinent state and federal regulations regarding air and water quality standards and health and safety criteria;
To minimize or prevent future hazards to public safety and welfare.
Simultaneous Excavation and Reclamation.
The reclamation or rehabilitation of natural resources sites with a projected life of more than one year shall be carried out simultaneously with the excavation of the resource. Objectives of simultaneous excavation and reclamation shall be:
To create a usable land resource and to eliminate waste heaps;
To prevent shallow, stagnant, small bodies of water, small unusable remnants of land, and eroding, barren slopes all normally associated with open pit operations, except to provide storm water detention facilities as described in the hydrologic report.
Excavations shall be planned so as progressively to develop the proposed final land forms by grading and by stockpiling overburden materials in areas designated for future land forms or in excavation where the material will be spread over the pit floor where no future excavation is anticipated. Such areas shall be seeded and planted immediately after grading is completed or within appropriate planting seasons, but in any case, the grading and planting shall be completed within one year. The reclamation plan shall contain a description of the phased rehabilitation process throughout the anticipated life of the mine.
Final Reclamation. Final reclamation shall begin immediately for any site where operations authorized under a natural resources permit have been abandoned for a period of one year, or otherwise terminated. The final reclamation shall conform to the plan approved (including approved modifications) in the natural resources permit. All reclamation plans shall conform at least to the minimum standard listed below and requirements listed elsewhere in the ordinance; provided however, that the planning commission may require more stringent standards where special hazards exist in order to protect the health, safety, or general welfare of the public, and to prevent injury to property or improvements.
Grading. Slopes, overburden stockpiles and abandoned soil piles shall be graded and smoothed so as to control erosion and prevent the creation of potentially dangerous areas in accordance with the direction of the city engineer.
Water-Filled Areas. All excavations which create standing water or ponds shall be refilled with inert materials. This requirement shall not apply, however, to any water-filled excavations scheduled to become an integral part of the final reclamation plan. The rehabilitation of these areas shall be done in such a manner that the groundwater is not polluted as determined by the city engineer through consultation with the Utah County health department. Fill material shall be porous enough to allow for water dispersion unless otherwise specified in the reclamation plan.
Landscaping. Unless inconsistent with the final approved use of the reclaimed land, the excavated areas and all other disturbed areas shall be replanted and maintained with trees, shrubs, grasses or other vegetative ground cover, native to the area, in order to minimize erosion and to restore the land to a natural appearance previously approved by the city council.
Removal of Buildings and Equipment. As soon as excavation and/or manufacturing has been permanently terminated, all buildings and equipment (including electrical conduits) used in the administration of the operations shall be removed unless deemed necessary to the approved final use of the reclaimed site.
Reclamation Verification. At the conclusion of a mining operation and reclamation of the excavation site, the city engineer shall present to the city council a statement verifying the permit area has been reclaimed in compliance with the requirements of the Highland City excavation ordinance and reclamation plans previously submitted in compliance with this chapter. The city engineer shall certify to the city council that all requirements of this chapter have been met.

12.16.120 Provision Of Surety
Provision for Surety Before Operations Begin. After receiving notification that the application for a natural resource permit has been approved, but prior to commencement of such operation, the operator shall provide surety to the city in a form and amount to be determined by the city council in consultation with the city engineer.
Amount of Surety. In determining the amount of surety to be provided, the city council shall consider factual information as to the magnitude type and costs of approved reclamation activities planned for the land affected, and the nature, extent and duration of operations under the approved notice. The city council shall fix the amount of the bond reasonably related thereto, to protect the city and insure compliance with the requirements of the excavation permit; however, the amount of the bond shall not exceed one hundred percent of the estimated cost of rehabilitating the cost of the excavation. The bond shall be periodically reviewed to insure that the amount of the bond is capable of insuring adequate reclamation.
Form of Surety. In determining the form of surety to be provided by the owner, the city council shall approve a method acceptable to the owner and consistent with the requirements of this chapter which may be one or a combination of corporate surety bond, land, cash or other deposited securities.
Release of Surety. The liability under surety provisions shall continue until such time as released, in whole or in part, by the city council.
Forfeiture of Surety. If any operator shall fail or refuse to carry out the necessary land reclamation as set forth in the approved operation and reclamation plans, the city council may, after notice and hearing declare any surety filed for this purpose forfeited, or in case of a corporate bond, file suit against the owner and his bonding company. The city shall also have the right to file suit against the defaulting permittee for costs of rehabilitation and reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.

All policies shall include the city, its employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers and assigns, as insureds. Any reference to the city shall include the city, its employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers and assigns.
The coverage shall be primary insurance as respects the city, its employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers, and assigns. Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by the city, its employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers, and assigns shall be in excess of the permittee's insurance and shall not contribute to or with it.
Any failure to comply with reporting provisions of the policy shall not effect coverage provided to the city, its employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers, and assigns.
Coverage shall state that the permittee's insurance shall apply separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer's liability.
Underwriters shall have no right of recovery or subrogation against the city, it being the intent of the parties that the insurance policy so affected shall protect both parties and be primary coverage for any and all losses covered by the described insurance.
The insurance companies issuing the policy or policies shall have no recourse against the city for payment of any premiums due or for any assessments under any form of any policy.
Each insurance policy shall be endorsed to state that the coverage shall not be suspended, voided, canceled, or reduced in coverage or in limits, except after thirty days' prior written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested sent to the city.
Each policy shall be endorsed to indemnify, save harmless and defend the city and its officers and employees against any claim or loss, damage or expense sustained on account of damages to persons or property occurring by reason of permit work done by the permittee, his/her subcontractor or agent, whether or not the work has been completed and whether or not the right-of-way has been opened to public travel.
Each policy shall be endorsed to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city, and its officers and employees against any claim or loss, damage or expense sustained by any person occurring by reason of doing any work pursuant to the permit including, but not limited to falling objects or failure to maintain proper barricades and/or lights as required from the time work begins until the work is completed and right-of-way is opened for public use.

Consequently, the permittee shall be prepared to provide such copies prior to the issuance of the permit.
If any of the required policies are, or at any time become, unsatisfactory to the city as to form or substance, or if a company issuing any such policy is, or at any time becomes, unsatisfactory to the city, the permittee shall promptly obtain a new policy, submit the same to the city for approval, and thereafter submit verification of coverage as required by the city. Upon failure to furnish, deliver and maintain such insurance as provided herein, the city may declare the permit to be in default and pursue any and all remedies the city may have at law or in equity, including those actions outlined in this chapter.
The permittee shall include all subcontractors as insured under its policies or shall furnish separate certificates and endorsements for each subcontractor. All coverages for subcontractors shall be subject to all of the requirements stated herein.
Any deductibles or self-insured retentions shall be declared to and approved by the city. At the option of the city, either the insurer shall reduce or eliminate such deductibles or self-insured retentions as respects the city, its employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers or assigns, or the permittee shall procure a bond, in a form acceptable to the city, guaranteeing payment of losses and related investigations, claim administration, and defense expenses.

A provider may be relieved of the obligation of submitting certificates of insurance under the following circumstances:
If such company shall submit satisfactory evidence in advance that:
It is insured in the amounts set forth in this chapter, or has complied with state requirements to become self insured. Public utilities may submit annually evidence of insurance coverage in lieu of individual submissions for each permit; and
Such coverage provides to the city the same scope of coverage that would otherwise be provided by a separate policy as required by this chapter; or
The work to be performed under the permit issued to the applicant is to be performed by the city, in which case insurance or other risk transfer issues shall be negotiated between the city and the applicant by separate agreement.

13.18.040 STORM WATER SYSTEM DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS
Irrigation Ditches
All existing irrigation ditches located within a development site or straddling a development site boundary shall be piped with a sufficiently-sized pipe and shall be coordinated with the water user and approved by the Irrigation Company and City Engineer.
Storm drain discharges to private ditches require written approval from the ditch owners and design shall comply with the terms of approvals and the Storm Water Design Standards and Regulations and the Land Disturbance Permit.
Piping of ditches and modification to the diversion boxes require documented coordination with ditch owners or representative(s) and should receive written approval of ditch owners. Design and coordination requirements shall comply with the Storm Water Design Standards and Regulations and the Land Disturbance Permit documents.
Storm Water Design and BMP Manuals
Adoption. The municipality adopts as its storm water design and best management practices (BMPs) manuals the following publications, which are incorporated by reference in this chapter as if fully set out herein:
Highland City Storm Water Design Standards and Regulations
Highland City Storm Water Master Plan
Other guidance document for Storm used in the administration of the Highland City Storm Water Management Program.
These manuals include a list of acceptable BMPs and include specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each storm water practice. The manuals may be updated and expanded from time to time at the discretion of the governing body of the City, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local maintenance experience.  Storm water facilities that are designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
General Performance Criteria for Storm Water Management. Unless granted a waiver or judged by the City Engineer to be exempt, the following post construction performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites:
Design of storm drain systems in boundaries and discharges into a Highland City storm drain system require direct supervision of a Utah Registered Professional Engineer and shall carry the seal of the same supervising professional engineer.
All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with design storms specified in this chapter or in the BMP manuals and reduce the generation of post construction storm water runoff to preconstruction levels or 100-year historical runoff flow rates. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
The design of detention ponds shall also include the UPDES requirements for retention. If the requirements cannot be fulfilled, due to soil conditions, the property owner must request an exception to the City engineer and provide detailed soils information.
To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP manuals.
Storm water discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., cold water fisheries, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain storm water management practices.
Storm water discharges from “hot spots” may require the application of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land disturbance permits shall consult with the City Engineer to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design requirements.
The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the BMP manuals shall be used for sizing all storm water facilities.
Minimum Control Requirements
Storm water discharge during all construction activities shall comply with the terms of the Land Disturbance Permit, the Storm Water Design Standards and Regulations, and/or requirements set forth by the International Building Code and the State of Utah UPDES requirements.
Storm water designs shall meet the multi-stage storm frequency storage requirements as identified in the BMP manuals unless the City Engineer has granted the applicant a full or partial waiver for a particular BMP pursuant to HMC 13.18.060 of this chapter.
Runoff rates from one lot to another shall not exceed pre-existing conditions, per the City Design Standards, or increase in such a manner that may unreasonably and unnecessarily cause greater harm than before.
If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City Engineer may impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, flow velocity, timing, and rate of runoff.
Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP) Requirements. Property owners are responsible to manage storm water runoff and sediment, whether in conduit systems or on the surface, that traverse or originate on their property, unless this responsibility is relinquished through the terms and conditions of an easement. The Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP) shall include sufficient information to allow the City Engineer to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing storm water generated at the project site. To accomplish this goal, the Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP) shall include the following:
Topographic Base Map. A 1” = 100’ feet topographic base map of the site which extends a minimum of two hundred fifty (250) feet beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicates:
Existing surface water drainage, including stream, ponds, culverts, ditches, sink holes, wetlands; and the type, size, elevation, etc., of nearest upstream and downstream drainage structures;
Current land use, including all existing structures, locations of utilities, roads, and easements;
All other existing significant natural and artificial features;
Proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns, locations of utilities, roads, and easements; and the limits of clearing and grading;
Proposed structural BMPs;
A written description of the site plan and justification of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required.
Tabulations shall be provided for both existing and proposed land use and surface coverage materials, with specific types of permeability characteristics.
When deemed necessary by the City Engineer, the Topographic Base Map and Survey shall conform to the minimum levels established by the American Land and Title Association (A.L.T.A. Survey).
Calculations. Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the pre- development, during construction, and post-development conditions for the design storms specified in the BMP manuals. These calculations must show that the proposed storm water management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in compliance with this chapter and the guidelines of the BMP manuals. Such calculations shall include:
A description of the design storm frequency, duration, and intensity where applicable;
Time of concentration;
Curve numbers or runoff coefficients, including assumed soil moisture conditions;
Peak runoff rates and total runoff volumes for each watershed area;
Infiltration rates verified by percolation tests or geotechnical reports, where applicable;
Culvert, storm water sewer, ditch, and/or other storm water conveyance capacities;
Flow velocities;
Data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff for the design storms referenced in the BMP manuals; and
Documentation of sources for all computation methods and field test results.
Soils Information. If a storm water management control measure depends on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based upon on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles survey reports. The number and location of required soil borings or soil pits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the control measure.
Maintenance and Repair Plan. The design and planning of all storm water management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued performance.

13.28.020 Formula For Distribution

13.28.010 Eligibility, Approval And Division Of Water Escrow Division
Money being held in escrow by Highland City, which was paid by the developer of a subdivision to take the place of irrigation shares deeded (not including money deposited for irrigation distribution system) may be released at the discretion of the city council to home owners in said subdivision and sellers of water shares for purchase of the correct number (one share full season water per acre) of full season water shares. The difference in the distributable share of escrow money and the purchase price shall be the responsibility of the home owners.

These water shares, in turn, shall be deeded to the subdivision water company or purchaser and Highland City jointly. Highland City shall not permit any water purchased under the provision to be sold or used outside said subdivision. Taxes and fees assessed shall be paid by said water company or purchaser. Shares purchased in this manner shall be treated in the same way as water shares deeded to the city under the requirements of normal subdivision approval.

HMC (Ord. 1987-1 § I)
13.28.020 Formula For Distribution
In order to establish the distributable share of the escrow account available to a given lot owner the following factors apply: (A) Escrow money minus amount deposited for irrigation distribution system plus interest is the distributable escrow available; (B) Lot acreage divided by total acreage, less acreage of previous withdrawals, in subdivision determines percentage share. The following equation shall be used:

Distributable escrow available

x	individual lot acreage	= Available 	
total acreage - acreage 	escrow	/Lot
of previous withdrawals 	money	
Example:

$7,000.00 + $1,000.00 Int.	x	1.5 Acres =	$600.00
20 acres - 0	
1-½	$800.00		
Escrow money	600.00		
Owner pays	$200.00

13.36.010 Declaration Of Findings And Intent
Findings Regarding Rights-of-Way. Highland City finds that the rights-of-way within the city:
Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the city;
Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;
Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-being of the city and its citizens; and
Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement, relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way.
Finding Regarding Compensation. The city finds that the city should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
Finding Regarding Local Concern. The city finds that while telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
Finding Regarding Promotion of Telecommunications Services. The city finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscrimination basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational and community services.
Findings Regarding Franchise Standards. The city finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:
Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the rights-of-way to serve the public;
Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;
Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the city infrastructure;
Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights-of-way; and
Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Act") codified in this chapter (P.L. No. 96-104).
Power to Manage Rights-of-Way. The city adopts this telecommunications ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable, compensation for the use of rights-of-way by providers as expressly set forth by Section 253 of the Act.

Article II Franchise Required
13.36.050 Nonexclusive Franchise
13.36.060 Every Provider Must Obtain

13.36.090 Nature Of Franchise
13.36.100 Regulatory Approval Needed
13.36.110 Term

13.36.050 Nonexclusive Franchise
The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, and maintenance of systems in the city's rights-of-way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the city and provider.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 3.1)
13.36.060 Every Provider Must Obtain
Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services using the rights-of-way, and every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 3.2)

A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased, except as may be expressly provided in a franchise agreement. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-locating its system on the property of others, including the city's property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 3.3; Ord. 2000-28 § 5 (part))
13.36.080 Current Providers
Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety days of the effective date of this chapter. If such request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of Section 13.36.460.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 3.4)
13.36.090 Nature Of Franchise
The franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system on, over and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 3.5)
13.36.100 Regulatory Approval Needed
Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 4.4)
13.36.160 Taxes And Assessments
To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 4.5)
13.36.170 Interest On Late Payments
In the event that any payment is not actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 4.6)
13.36.180 No Accord And Satisfactory
No acceptance by Highland City of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 4.7)
13.36.190 Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees
The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable law.

HMC (Ord. 1998-2 § 4.9)
13.36.210 Costs Of Publication

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. O-2019-01 on 1/8/2019
13.38.010 Findings Regarding Right-Of-Way
Highland City finds that the right-of-way within the City:
Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the City;
Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;
.Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit to the enhancement of the health,welfare, and general economic well-being of the City and its citizens; and
 a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities construction,placement, relocation, and maintenance in the right-of-way.
Finding Regarding Compensation. The City finds the right to occupy portions of the right-of-way for limited times for the business of providing personal wireless services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to theCity and its taxpayers, and, therefore, the taxpayers of the City should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the right-of-way.
 Regarding Local Concern. The City finds that while wireless communication facilities are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal franchising, and vital business and community services, which are of local concern.
.Finding Regarding Promotion of Wireless Communication Services. The City finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the development of wireless communication services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational and community services.
 Regarding Franchise Standards. The City finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:
 and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
 competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the right-of-way to serve the public;
 protects the public interests and the City from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of right-of-way;
 the police powers and right-of-way management authority of the City, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the City’s infrastructure;
the public’s investment in improvements in the right-of-way; and
Ensures that no barriers to entry of providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Act”) (P.L. No. 96-104).
Power to Manage Right-of-Way. The City adopts the wireless communication services ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to its power to manage its rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution and statutory authority, and to receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of right-of-way by providers as expressly set forth in federal and state law.

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. O-2019-01 on 1/8/2019

13.38.310 Equipment
Due to the limited size of the City’s right-of-way, applicants shall be required to install any equipment associated with a small wireless facility according the following requirements to the extent operationally and technically feasible and to the extent permitted by law.
Existing utility poles. If a WCF is collocated on an existing utility pole, the WCF’s associated equipment may be installed in one of the following methods:
Within a pole. Any equipment installed within a pole may not protrude from the pole except to the extent reasonably necessary to connect to power or a wireline.
On a pole. Any equipment enclosure installed on a pole must:
Be flush with the pole;
Painted to reasonably match the color of the pole;
May not exceed in width the diameter of the pole by more than 3 inches on either side;
May not allow the furthest point of the enclosure to extend more than 18 inches from the pole; and
Be installed flush with the grade or, alternatively, the lowest point may not be lower than 8 feet from the grade directly below the equipment enclosure.
Underground. Any equipment installed underground shall be located in a park strip within the City’s right-of-way and shall be installed and maintained level with the surrounding grade.
Private property. Any equipment installed on private property must provide written permission from the property owner allowing the applicant to locate facilities on the property. If equipment is placed in an enclosure, the enclosure shall be designed to blend in with existing surroundings, using architecturally compatible construction and colors, and landscaping and shall be located as unobtrusively as possible consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF. Equipment placed on private property may be subject to zoning requirements.
Replacement utility poles. If a WCF is collocated on a replacement utility pole, the WCF’s associated equipment may be installed in the following manner:
To the extent technologically feasible, a provider must install the WCF’s associated equipment within the replacement utility pole in accordance with 13.38.310(A)(1)(a).
If the installation of the WCF’s equipment within the replacement utility pole is technologically infeasible, a provider may install the WCF’s associated equipment in accordance with any of the methods established in 13.38.310(A)(1)(b) – (d).
New utility poles. If a WCF is collocated on a new utility pole, a provider must install the WCF’s associated equipment within the pole in accordance with 13.38.310(A)(1)(a) or (d).
As required for the operation of a WCF or its equipment, an electric meter may be installed in accordance with requirements from the electric provider; provided, that the electric meter must be installed in the location that (1) minimizes its interference with other users of the City’s right-of-way including, but not limited to, pedestrians, motorists, and other entities with equipment in the right-of-way, and (2) minimizes its aesthetic impact.
The City shall not provide an exemption to these requirements when there is insufficient room in the right-of-way to place facilities at ground-level and to comply with ADA requirements, public safety concerns for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists, or other articulable public safety concerns.

13.38.330 Visual Impact
Minimization. All WCFs shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public to the greatest extent reasonably possible within 100 feet of a site and consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF.
Integration. WCFs and equipment shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site. Such WCFs shall be designed to be compatible with the built environment, through matching and complimentary existing structures and specific design considerations such as architectural designs, height, scale, color and texture or be consistent with other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant vicinity.
Decorative poles. If a provider must displace a decorative pole to collocate a small wireless facility, the replacement pole must reasonably conform to design aesthetic of the displaced decorative pole.
Small wireless facility antennas should be concealed by a shroud.
When a freestanding power shut-off or power meter is required and cannot be integrated into the pole, the structure must be enclosed in a cabinet or pedestal.
Design/Historic Districts. Subject to Utah Code Ann. § 54-21-208, a provider’s design and location must be approved prior to collocating a new small wireless facility or installing a new utility pole in the following zones:
Historic districts and any neighboring areas within a ¼ mile
Timpanogos Highway Corridor

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. O-2019-01 on 1/8/2019
13.38.340 Stealth Design/Technology
Stealth design is required and concealment techniques must be appropriate given the proposed location, design, visual environment, and nearby uses, structures, and natural features. Stealth design shall be designed and constructed to substantially conform to surrounding utility poles, light poles, or other similar support structures in the rights-of-way so the WCF is visually unobtrusive.
Stealth design requires screening WCFs in order to reduce visual impact. The provider must screen all substantial portions of the facility from view. Such screening should match the color and be of similar finish of the attached support structure.
WCFs and their associated equipment must be installed flush with any pole or support structure (including antennas mounted directly above the top of an existing pole or support structure) and the furthest point of an antenna or equipment may not extend beyond 18 inches from the pole or support structure except if the pole owner requires use of a standoff to comply with federal, state, or local rules, regulations, or laws. Any required standoff may not defeat stealth design and concealment techniques.
Stealth and concealment techniques do not include incorporating faux-tree designs of a kind that are not native to the state.

HISTORY
Adopted by Ord. O-2019-01 on 1/8/2019
13.38.460 Application To Install Macrocell Or Non-Permitted Utility Pole
The City generally does not permit macrocells and utility poles that are not permitted under Utah Code Ann. § 54-21-204. The City will only permit a nonpermitted macrocell or utility pole if required by federal law.
Macrocells and utility poles that are not permitted under Utah Code Ann. § 54-21-204, as amended, and are not subject to the application approval process established herein. As such, this Section implements, in part, 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7) of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, as interpreted by the FCC in its Report and Order No. 14-153.
Application Review for nonpermitted macrocells and utility poles.
The City shall prepare and make publicly available an application form, the requirements of which shall be limited to the information necessary for the City to consider whether an application is a request to install a nonpermitted macrocell or utility pole.
Upon receipt of an application for a nonpermitted macrocell or utility pole pursuant to this Section, the City shall review such application, make its final decision to approve or disapprove the application, and advise the applicant in writing of its final decision.
Within 150 days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval of a nonpermitted macrocell or utility pole under this Section, the City shall review and act upon the application, subject to the tolling provisions below.
The 150-day review period begins to run when the application is filed and may be tolled only by mutual agreement between the City and the applicant, or in cases where the City determines that the application is incomplete.
To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the City must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application.
The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the City’s notice of incompleteness.
Following a supplemental submission, the City will notify the applicant within 10 days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this Section. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.
Failure to Act. In the event the City fails to approve or deny a complete application under this Section within the time frame for review (accounting for any tolling), the applicant shall be entitled to pursue all remedies under applicable law.
In addition to the information required above, a nonpermitted macrocell or utility pole application must also include the following information:
The manufacturer’s recommended installation, if any;
A written affirmation for the applicant that the macrocell or utility pole meets or exceeds all applicable codes, applicable standards, and federal, state, and local requirements, laws, regulations, and polices;
A map that indicates the type and separation distance of other WCFs owned or operated by the same wireless provider from the proposed WCF.
A visual analysis including to-scale photo and visual simulations that show unobstructed before-and-after construction daytime and clear-weather views from at least two angles, together with a map that shows the location of each view including all equipment and ground wires. Such visual analysis must include a description, drawing, and elevations with the finished color, method of camouflage, and any illumination;
A detailed explanation justifying why the WCF is required in the right-of-way. The applicant must demonstrate in a clear and complete written alternative sites analysis that multiple alternatives in the geographic range of the service coverage objectives of the applicant were considered. This includes, but is not limited to, explaining why the installation of permitted small wireless facilities and the installation of a macrocell on private property are insufficient. This analysis must include a factually detailed and meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative candidate and the proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the applicant rejected the alternative candidate.
A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection may not include less than 5 alternative sites unless the applicant provides a factually detailed rational for why it could not identify at least 5 potentially available sites.
For purposes of disqualifying potential alternative sites for the failure to meet the applicant’s service coverage objectives the applicant must provide (a) a description of its objective, whether it be to close a gap or address a deficiency in coverage, capacity, frequency or technology; (b) detailed technical maps or other exhibits with clear and concise RF data to illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative; and (c) a description of why the alternative does not meet the objective.
An explanation that demonstrates the following:
A significant gap in the coverage, capacity, or technologies of the service network exists such that users are frequently unable to connect to the service network, or are regularly unable to maintain a connection, or are unable to achieve reliable wireless coverage within a building;
The gap can only be filled through an exception to one or more of the standards herein; and
The exception is narrowly tailored to fill the service gap such that WCF conforms to these standards to the greatest extent possible.
The manner in which the applicant proposes to fill the significant gap in coverage, capacity, or technologies of the service network is the least intrusive means on the values that these regulations seek to protect.
A noise study for the proposed WCF and all associated equipment. The application shall provide manufacturer’s specifications for all noise-generating equipment, such as air conditioning units and back-up generators, and a depiction of the equipment location in relation to adjoining properties. The applicant shall provide a noise study prepared and sealed by a qualified Utah-license Professional Engineer that demonstrates that the WCF will comply with intent and goals of this chapter.
The proposed WCF may not be closer than the average distance between existing poles that are within one mile of the proposed site. If no poles exist within one mile of proposed pole site, then all subsequently placed poles must be at least 250’ from each other.
The design of a new pole must comply with the requirements of this chapter and be approved by the City.
An affidavit certifying that the applicant has posted or mailed notices to property owners within 300’ of the proposed WCF site.
This requirement is not required to be met at the time application is submitted, but is required to be completed prior to approval of a permit.
The notice shall provide the following information:
The applicant’s name and contact information.
A phone number for the provider by which an individual could request additional information.
A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type, height and width of the proposed tower, separation distances, adjacent roadways, photo simulations, a depiction of all proposed transmission equipment, setbacks from property lines and the nearest buildings, and elevation drawings or renderings of the proposed tower and any other structures.
Language that states “If you have any public safety concerns or comments regarding the aesthetics or placement of this wireless communication facility, please submit your written comments within 14 days to:

No provider shall receive a wireless franchise unless it agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this chapter governing construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any other reasonable requirements or procedures specified by the City or the wireless franchise, including requirements regarding colocation and cost sharing.
No antenna, small wireless facility, or other equipment may be added to City poles where the City poles are not able to structurally accommodate the antenna, small wireless facility, or other equipment. All antenna, small wireless facility, or other equipment permitted herein may be added to City poles only pursuant to a pole attachment agreement with the City.
WCFs that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this chapter shall be allowed to continue their use as they presently exist. This code does not make lawful any WCF that is not fully approved on the date the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted and those pending WCFs will be required to meet the requirements of this code.
The applicant must comply with all federal (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act), state, and local laws, city codes and requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, participating in Blue Stakes of Utah as required by Utah Code §54-8a-2 through §54-8a-13, as amended.
In the installation of any WCF within the rights-of-way, care must be taken to install in such a way that does not damage, interfere with, or disturb any other utility or entity that may already be located in the area. Any damage done to another utility’s or entity’s property must be immediately reported to both the City and the owner of the damaged property, and must be promptly repaired by the provider, with the provider being responsible for all costs of repair, including any extra charges that may be assessed for emergency repairs. Failure to notify the City and the damaged property owner will result in revocation of the franchise agreement. When approving the location for a WCF, the location of utilities or other entities’ property, or the need for the location of other utilities, within the rights-of-way must be considered before approval to locate the WCF will be given in order to ensure those other services to the public are not disrupted.
All WCFs and utility poles must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate WCFs and utility poles including, but not limited to, RF emissions. If such standards and regulations are changed, and if WCF equipment is added either through colocation or replacement, then the owners of the WCFs and utility poles governed by this chapter shall bring such WCFs and utility poles into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring WCFs and utility poles into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF or utility pole at the owner’s expense.
All structures shall be constructed and installed to manufacturer’s specifications, and constructed to withstand a minimum 100-mile per hour (mph) wind.
The following maintenance requirements apply to WCFs, as applicable:
All landscaping shall be maintained at all times.
All WCF sites shall be kept clean, neat, and free of litter.
A WCF shall be in good condition at all times. Rusting, dirt, or peeling facilities are prohibited.
All equipment cabinets shall display a legible operator’s contact number for reporting maintenance problems.
The applicant shall provide a description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs and potential safety impacts of such maintenance.
Inspections.
The City or its agents shall have authority to enter onto the rights-of-way upon which a WCF is located to inspect the facility for the purpose of determining whether it complies with the applicable codes and applicable standards.
The City reserves the right to conduct such inspections at any time. In the event such inspection results in a determination that violation of applicable standards set forth by the City has occurred, the City will notify the provider of the violation.
Upon receipt of a notice of violation, the provider will have 30 days from the date of violation to correct the violation. If the provider fails to correct the violation within the 30-day period, the City may remove the violating WCF or utility pole at the provider’s sole expense.
The City may recover all of its costs incurred in processing and removing the violation.

The purpose of this chapter is to insure the provision of a safe and sanitary drinking water supply for the city by the establishment of drinking water source protection zones surrounding the wellheads for all wells which are the supply sources for the city water system and by the designation and regulation of property uses and conditions which may be maintained within such zones.
HMC (Ord. 1999-3 § 1)

13.40.020 Definitions
When used in this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given in this section:

"Design standard" means a control which is implemented by a potential contamination source to prevent discharges to the ground water. Spill protection is an example of a design standard.

"Land management strategies" means zoning and nonzoning controls which include, but are not limited to, the following: zoning and subdivision ordinances, site plan reviews, design and operating standards, source prohibitions, purchase of property and development rights, public education programs, groundwater monitoring, household hazardous waste collection programs, water conservation programs, memoranda of understanding, written contacts and agreements, and so forth.

"Pollution source" means point source discharges of contaminants to groundwater or potential discharges of the liquid forms of "extremely hazardous substances" which are stored in containers in excess of "applicable threshold planning quantities" as specified in SARA Title III. Examples of possible pollution sources include, but are nor limited to, the following: storage facilities that store the liquid forms of extremely hazardous substances, septic tanks, drain fields, class V underground injection wells, landfills, open dumps, landfilling of sludge and septage, manure piles, salt piles, pit privies, and animal feeding operations with more than ten animal units.

13.52.040 Administration
13.52.050 Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction

13.52.010 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

"Alluvial fan flooding" means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.

"Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

"Area of special flood hazard" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.

"Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

"Base Flood Elevation (BFE)" means  the water surface elevation of the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event.  It is the height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of coastal and riverine areas. It is also the elevation shown on the FIRM and found in the accompanying Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a 1-percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year.

"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

"Critical Feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

"Development" means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

"Elevated building" means for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building which has its lowest floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings or columns.

"Existing construction" means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures."

"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

"Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from

The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

"Flood insurance study" is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map. 

"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 

"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 

"Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 

"Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 

"Flood proofing" means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 

"Floodway (regulatory floodway)" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

"Functionally Dependent Use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. structure" means any structure that is:

Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;
Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or
Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either:
By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or;
Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 

"Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 

"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 

"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 

"New construction" means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 

"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 

"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:

Built on a single chassis;
Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
"Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

"Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 

"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 

"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or
Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
"Variance" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)

"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 

"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.(Ord. 2001-17 (part))

13.52.040 Administration
Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The city administrator is hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.
Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance.
Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.
Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of this ordinance.
Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.
Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Floodplain Manager at Division of Emergency Management, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 13.52.030.B, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Section 13.52
.040.
When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (Conditional Letter of Map Revision).
Permit Procedures.
Application for a development permit shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required:
Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;
A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of Section 13.52.040.B(2))
;
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with Section 13.52.040.B(1).
Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors:
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area.
Variance Procedures.
The appeal board as established by the community shall hear and render judgement on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
The appeal board shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance.
Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section C(2) of this Article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance codified in this section (Article 1, Section C).
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Prerequisites for granting variances:
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
Showing a good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
The criteria outlined in Article 4, Section D(1)—) are met, and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Section 13.52.040.C.1.a, is satisfied.
Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Manufactured Homes.
Require that within Zone AO, all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
Require that within Zone AO, all manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of this section be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
Recreational Vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days;
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
Meet the permit requirements of Article 4, Section C(1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph 4 of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
Standards for Subdivision Proposals.
All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent withSection 13.52.10 of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of Section 13.52.30.C and Section 13.52.040.C ; and the provisions of Section 13.52.040 of this chapter.

Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 13.52.030.2 or Section 13.52.040.2(9) of this chapter.
All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 13.52.030.B, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures;
Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 13.52.030(C)(1)(a), are satisfied.
Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 13.52.030.B, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
If Section 13.52.040(E)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 13.52.040.
Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

Preface
This is the online version of the Development Code of Highland City, Utah. The Highland Development
Code has been placed into its own online book for organizational purposes and ease of use for citizens,
developers, city staff and others.
This Code is arranged by subject matter and divided into various chapters, articles and sections, and
although part of the Municipal Code, follows a different structure than the Municipal Code which uses a
decimal numbering system. This Development Code numbering system is described as follows:
? The first number in the sequence (1-101) designates the Chapter level
? The second number in the sequence, following the hyphen (1-101) designates the Article level.
Articles sometimes contain periods for increased expansion.
? The last few numbers in the sequence (1-101) usually designate the Section level
Vacant titles, chapters or sections may be designed for future use and may be marked "Reserved" to
ease internal expansion.
The Highland Development Code is amended and supplemented from time to time with amendments,
additions and deletions adopted by ordinance of the Highland City Council. The specific provisions of
this online code have been compiled and codified to comprise the Highland Development Code as
adapted from the official ordinances adopted by the City Council. In the event of discrepancies between
the online Highland Development Code and the official hard copy of the ordinances adopted by the City
Council, the hard copy enactment governs.
The legislative history of each particular section of the Highland Development Code is provided at the
end of each section in italicized text and is used to keep track of and identify the specific ordinances and
enabling legislation. The legislative history refers to each ordinance adopted by the City Council which
affects that particular section and indicates whether the section has been affected by virtue of a specific
legislative action. A link to the actual ordinance is also provided when available.
NOTICE: THIS ONLINE HIGHLAND DEVELOPMENT CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE
MOST CURRENT VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE HIGHLAND CITY COUNCIL. IT IS
THE CITY'S POLICY AND PRACTICE TO UPDATE THIS ONLINE DEVELOPMENT CODE AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE AFTER LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL, BUT SOME
DELAY MAY OCCUR BETWEEN THE TIME OF ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS AND THE UPDATING
OF THIS ONLINE CODE. IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS ONLINE CODE AND THE
OFFICIAL ORDINANCES ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL, THE ORDINANCES SHALL GOVERN.
ALSO, THIS DEVELOPMENT CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES, REGULATIONS, STANDARDS
OR SPECIFICATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER AUTHORITY OF THIS CODE OR STATE LAW.
PLEASE CONTACT JODY BATES, THE HIGHLAND CITY RECORDER, FOR THE STATUS OF ANY

3-209 Existing Planned Residential Developments

planned residential developments created under earlier ordinances, to the end that the quality of
living environment will be maintained and the development completed to final capacity as
originally intended, (b) prohibit any construction of new planned residential developments, and 8
require for information purposes the restrictive covenants be on file with the City.
2. Planned Residential Development is large scale development of clustered dwellings and
common areas which were planned and developed within the provisions set forth in previous
ordinances.
3. All uses of existing Planned Residential Developments shall be subject to the restrictions and
conditions contained within the zone requirements of the specific zone which originally allowed
said construction and furthermore shall continue to adhere to any design criteria and all
standards and requirements set forth at the time of final approval of said planned residential
development.
4. Any failure on the part of the developer or his assigns to maintain the Planned Residential
Development in accordance with the approved management policies, covenants, conditions,
restrictions, and agreements shall be, and the same is hereby declared to be, a public nuisance,
endangering to health, safety, and general welfare of the public and a detriment to the
surrounding community and that in addition to any other remedy provided by law for the
abatement or removal of such public nuisance, the city may remove or abate the nuisance and
charge the cost thereof, including reasonable attorney fees to the owners as provided by Chapter
11 of Title 10, Utah Code Annotated, as amended.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 5/321
5. If any of the land contained within a Planned Residential Development is divided into two or more
parts or separately owned units, the developer shall first establish a property owners' association
or a trustee approved by the City Council as the successor to the owner, which will ensure proper
maintenance of the common facilities. It shall be unlawful to divide any Planned Residential
Development into two (2) or more separately owned units until such property owners' association
or trustee has been established which shall provide, among other things, that each owner shall
be subject to a charge for the maintenance of the common property, that said charge shall
constitute a lien upon said property in the event of the owner's failure or neglect to pay his prorata
share and that the association or trustee shall assume the responsibility for maintenance of
any member of said association to pay his pro-rata share. It shall be unlawful for a property
owners' association or trustee to discontinue the maintenance of the common facilities and the
landscaping of the same. In case of failure or neglect to comply with the conditions and
regulations as herein established, and as specifically made applicable to a Planned Residential
Development, such failure or neglect shall be deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. The
City may also recover costs resulting from such failure or neglect by civil action.

with that of providing landscaped common area for the aesthetic and recreational satisfaction of

area objectives, may be permitted only with the written approval of the City Council following
approval of building, site, and operational plans by the Planning Commission.
7. Each Planned Residential Development within the boundary of Highland City shall be required to
maintain on file in the City Office Building one copy of the restrictive covenants for said
development as originally prepared by the respective architectural committee. Restrictive
covenants shall be considered current and any change and addition to said covenants shall
require amending the document on file with Highland City within thirty (30) days from the time of
any change and/or addition. This modification shall be done in writing by representatives of the
architectural committee of said development and delivered to the City Offices.
3-210 Nonconforming Building Setbacks - Cottages On The Green Planned Unit Development

justify reduced setbacks. Building setback exceptions are as follows:
1. Front setback shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet to the nearest point of the building
foundation;

3-4330 Security: Site Improvements/Project Completion
3-4301 Introduction: Purpose/Intent
The design guidelines provided herein for the C-1 Zone have been devised as a method of achieving a
high quality, cohesive design for commercial development in Highland City. These guidelines will serve
as design criteria to developers, builders, engineers, architects, landscape architects and other
professionals in preparing plans for construction. In addition, these articles will lend guidance to staff, the
Planning Commission and the City Council in the review and evaluation of future development projects
related to commercial development. There are certain key design elements which contribute significantly
to the visual order and consistency of the entire commercial area. These common features--site
planning, architecture, landscape design, parking, signage, lighting and other details--are the subject of
this ordinance. The guidelines express the desired character of future development. Each guideline shall
be considered in terms of how it applies to a given project. The intent of the guidelines must be met in
order for a project to be approved during the plan review process.
1. The purpose of this ordinance is to define a range of goods and services which may be offered
by commercial entities within the community and to establish guidelines for the physical
development of such commercial entities.

3-4305 Site Coverage
Coverage regulates the area of the site that may be covered by the building. Covered walkways, roof
structure overhangs, and other solar protection or aesthetic structural elements should not be included in
building coverage calculations. These guidelines also help protect area dedicated to landscape and
parking.
1. Coverage of a site by a building structure shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total
site. This coverage may be increased, subject to the approval of the City Planning Commission, if
the project demonstrates superior response to the commercial zoning guidelines. In no case,
however, shall site coverage exceed 35 percent.
2. When covered parking structures are provided, such structures shall not cover more than an
additional 30 percent of the ground plane.
3. In all site plan configurations, landscaping shall occupy no less than fifteen percent (15%) of the
total land area under development.
3-4306 Building Setbacks
It shall be within the authority of the Planning Commission to determine, for any lot in this district, which
property line or lines shall be considered as side or as rear lines for the purpose of administering this
ordinance.
1. No building shall be closer to a public street right-of-way than eighty (80) feet unless all parking is
provided in the rear of the building, in which case it may be no closer than forty (40) feet. No
building, with the exception of any portion that contains a drive-up window or counter, shall be
closer than thirty (30) feet from any private road or driveway. Structures which are adjacent to a
plaza, mall, or other permanent pedestrian open space under the same ownership as the
structure may abut the space and have openings into it.
2. The public street right-of-way line shall be considered the front property line of a lot. Where a lot
is bordered on two or more sides by a public street right-of-way, all such sides shall be
considered as front property lines, and the area between the front property line and the building
lines shall be known as the front setback area in all cases. Canopies, overhangs, and similar
coverings may project into the front setback area, as much as 10', if approved by the Planning
Commission.
3. Side setback areas shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet including canopies and overhangs except
where a side property line abuts a residential district, in which case the setback area shall be a
minimum of twenty-five (25) feet.
4. Rear setback areas shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet except where a rear property line abuts a
residential district, in which case the rear setback area shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25)
feet.
3-4307 Building Height
1. The maximum height for all buildings shall not exceed thirty (30) feet, measured from natural
grade, and no building shall be erected to a height less than ten (10) feet or one story above
grade. Where the ground or the top of the building is uneven in height, the average elevation
thereof shall apply. Maximum height shall include signs and parapets or any other projection
from the building.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 60/321
2. The height requirements of this section shall apply to all commercial developments, except that
after review by the planning commission, the commission may approve, disapprove, or approve
with modifications a request for an increase in the allowable height up to thirty-six (36) feet.
3. The City Planning Commission must take into account the following criteria when a proposal for
height adjustment is requested:
a. The geographical position of the building and possible visual effects on existing structures
on or off site.
b. Potential problems on neighboring sites caused by shadows, loss of solar access, loss or
air circulation, closing of views, or ridge line intrusion.
c. The influence on the general vicinity including contact with existing buildings and
structures, streets, traffic congestion and circulation, and adjacent open space;
d. In no case will any increase in height be permitted when the effect of the height increase
is to increase the allowable square footage over that which is, or would be, possible under
normal zone standards.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 61/321
5. Note: Since walls and hedges are a main visual feature in any development, regulations related
to the placement, size and appearance of such structures must be enacted. The following
standards shall apply to the installation of all fences, walls, hedges or other visual obstructions
used for the purpose of screening, either around the perimeter of the development site or within
the development site:
a. No wall, hedge or other visual obstruction in excess of six (6) feet shall be allowed on any
commercial development site, unless along a district boundary which abuts a residential
zone, in which case the height shall be eight (8) feet.
b. When there is a difference in the ground level between two adjoining lots, the height of
any fence, wall, or hedge constructed along the property line shall be determined by using
the finished grade of the highest contiguous lot.
c. Only one (1) type of fence or wall design shall be permitted on any one (1) parcel or
development. The design may include an appropriate mix of materials subject to the
guidelines of these articles and approval by the City Planning Commission.

or mortar washed brick.
i. If walls are finished in stucco, colors will be limited to earth tones. No bright or neon
colors will be allowed.
j. Any hedges used as screening shall be consistent in appearance to the general
landscape of the site. Such hedges may be geometric in shape, but shall be pruned and
maintained so as to avoid unsightly appearance and to avoid vehicular sight hazards.
3-4309 Parking
Except as may be provided elsewhere in this ordinance, there shall be provided at the time of erection of
any building, or at the time any main building is enlarged or increased in capacity, minimum off-street
parking space with adequate provisions for ingress and egress by standard-sized automobiles. If any
land, structure or use is changed from one use to another which requires more off-street parking spaces,
there shall be provided such additional off-street parking for the new use as is required by this chapter.
1. Parking Lot Characteristics. Each parcel of land developed for off-street parking in response to
the requirements of this chapter shall provided the following characteristics:
a. Surfacing. Each lot shall have a paved, all-weather surfacing material consisting of a
minimum of six (6) inches of road base with three (3) inches of asphalt, or, three (3)

direct light away from any adjoining residential buildings. Lighting details are specified in
Section 3-4316 of this Code.
d. Size of Spaces. Each parking space shall be a minimum of nine (9) feet wide by eighteen
(18) feet long. For uses such as grocery stores, the use of wider spaces with "hairpin" or
double line markings is encouraged to ensure adequate space between parked cars to
accommodate a shopping cart.
e. Handicapped Parking. All structures which are required by the provisions of the Uniform
Building Code to have adaptations which assist access by handicapped persons shall, in
addition, provide off-street parking for handicapped persons as described below or as
required by applicable State or Federal regulations. The provisions described below are
minimum requirements, which for good cause, may be altered by recommendation of the
Planning Commission and approval of the City Council.

2. Specific Requirements for Each Land Use. Minimum required off-street parking shall be provided
for each use as listed below. Requirements calculated on square footage of commercial space
shall be based upon floor area devoted to the principal use or sales and shall not include area
devoted to storage, rest rooms, or maintenance areas. Parking for uses not specifically listed
below shall be provided in the same ratio as the use most nearly approximating the
characteristics of the unlisted use, as determined by the Planning Commission. Parking shall be
provided as follows, with spaces based upon one or a combination of uses listed. Parking stalls
for all uses shall be in accordance with the following ratios:
a. Parking stalls per 1,000 square feet of gross square feet of building area.

requirements based upon actual usage of employees and customers, but in no case shall
the requirements be reduced by more than twenty-five (25) percent.
d. In cases where the category into which a use should be placed is unclear, or a use does
not conform to any of the above categories, or the use is allowed under a Conditional Use
Permit, the Planning Commission shall determine the appropriate category or establish a
parking ratio.
e. In cases where uses occupying the same structure or within two-hundred and fifty (250)
feet of one another on the same lot or adjacent lots under the same ownership are uses
where parking demand times do not normally or significantly overlap, shared parking may
be permitted by the Planning Commission. At the time of site plan review for each
development increment, a precise parking plan shall be submitted showing all parking
spaces, the overall circulation system, an analysis of the parking demand for the specific
land uses proposed, and other justification as necessary for requesting reductions in
parking space requirements.

3. Location of Parking.
a. No on-street parking shall be permitted in a commercial zone. No parking shall be
permitted in the minimal front, side or rear setback areas except:
i. Where a side or rear setback area abuts a residential zone, parking may be
permitted to within ten (10) feet of the district line, if in the determination of the
Planning Commission the parking will be necessary only during the normal
daytime weekday working hours.
ii. Where parking within the front or side setback areas is adequately separated from
public rights-of-way with continuous landscaping at least thirty (30) feet wide, less
areas for curb inlets and drive entrances.
b. Required off-street parking shall be provided on the site of the use served, or on an
alternate site within the same district. Where parking is provided on other than the site
concerned, a recorded document shall be filed with the Planning Commission and signed
by the owners of the alternate site, stipulating to the permanent reservation of use of the
site for said parking. The parking setback restrictions set forth above shall also apply to
contiguous or alternate parking sites.
c. Parking facilities need not be located in one consolidated area of a particular site, but may
be separated by landscaping or building elements.
4. Commercial Vehicle Parking.
a. Vehicles that display any form of advertising of a commercial enterprise, including names,
phone numbers, logos or associated artwork, are prohibited from parking in street right-ofways
or private parking lots within public view (visible from a public roadway).
b. Parking for commercial vehicles is limited to properly screened loading areas and other
approved off-street parking that is properly screened from public view.
c. Commercial vehicles include, but are not limited to, cars, trucks, vans, trailers, fork lifts,
and motorized cycles.
5. Landscaping of Parking Areas.
a. Where possible, siting parking areas lower than adjacent roadways and continuing
streetscape grading, berms, hedges, and other landscape treatment into parking areas is
encouraged, with intent to reduce their visual impact and to screen the parking from the
adjacent roadway. All parking areas adjacent to roadways shall require a landscaped
berm of width and height specified in Section 3-4308 of this ordinance.
b. Planter "islands" between parking bays shall measure six (6) feet from the outside edge
of the curb, or five (5) feet inside dimension, to provide adequate space for tree trunks,
hedges or parking lot light supports and to allow for proper maintenance.
c. Vehicles shall be prevented from overhanging into landscaped areas through extended
curbs or the use of concrete wheel stops.

6. Other Considerations.
a. Circulation within the parking areas shall provide for free flow of vehicular traffic. The onsite
parking and traffic circulation plan shall be a part of the traffic impact analysis
required as a part of the preliminary site plan review required by Section 3-4328 of this
Code.
b. Bicycle parking areas with suitable racks shall be provided in convenient locations.
Randomly strewn bicycles are not only unsightly, but can create a safety hazard. Bicycle
parking areas shall be located so to minimize conflict with pedestrian walkways.
c. Provision for loading/unloading areas for local transit busses (e.g. UTA) are encouraged
on-site or along the periphery of the site (e.g. Bus bays). Such loading areas shall be
located as far as practicable from intersections and access drives so as not to interfere
with the safe operation of streets and driveways or impede traffic flow.
d. Changes in occupancy or type of use, and increases in the intensity of use on any site
may require changes in parking. Sufficient parking to meet the requirements of actual
tenants shall be provided on-site.

provided within the lot lines.
3. Such loading areas should be located away from the public street to which the use is oriented.
4. To the greatest extent possible, loading areas should be screened from all public streets. This
shall be accomplished through careful site planning, and the use of screen walls and
landscaping.
5. In no event shall a loading dock be closer than seventy-five (75) feet from a property line fronting
upon a street.
6. Loading berths shall be required as follows:

2. In establishing permissible curb openings and sidewalk driveway crossings for access to private
property, they shall not be authorized where they are unnecessary or where they would
reasonably interfere with the movement of vehicular traffic, with public improvements, or with the
rights of the public in the adjacent street or alley, and in no case shall any curb opening be of
greater length than necessary for reasonable access to the property to be served thereby. In
determining the length of curb openings and spacing of driveways, the end transitions in each
case will be considered a part of the length of the curb opening.

3-4350 Introduction: Purpose/Intent
It is the purpose of this section of the Highland City Development Code to provide citizens with the
services they need or desire to have in Highland City and to provide them “in a manner that will promote
the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and general welfare of the present and future
inhabitants of the City.” The provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be the minimum requirements
needed to promote the overall purposes of the development code as is stated in Section 1-102 and 1-
103 of this code. The design guidelines provided herein for the C-R Zone have been devised as a
method of achieving a high quality, cohesive design for commercial development in Highland City.
These guidelines will serve as design criteria to developers, builders, engineers, architects, landscape
architects and other professionals in preparing plans for construction. In addition, these articles will lend
guidance to staff, the Planning Commission and the City Council in the review and evaluation of future
development projects related to commercial development. There are certain key design elements which
contribute significantly to the visual order and consistency of the entire commercial area. These common
features—site planning, architecture, landscape design, parking, signage, lighting and other details—are
the subject of this ordinance. The guidelines express the desired character of future development. Each
guideline shall be considered in terms of how it applies to a given project. The intent of the guidelines
must be met in order for a project to be approved during the plan review process.
1. The overall intent of these regulations is to establish a standard for commercial development and
maintenance which:
a. Establishes strict standards for buffering, protection against noise and air pollution
thereby minimizing undue hardships on adjacent residences and land uses.
b. Promotes the overall safety, functionality, and visual attractiveness of commercial
buildings, accompanying substructures, and surrounding landscape
c. Promotes the ability of the commercial entities to succeed.
d. Promotes the successful completion of the project
e. Promotes quality architecture
f. Allows some flexibility of architecture to encourage creativity of design.
2. A second purpose of this ordinance is to define a range of goods and services which may be
offered by commercial entities within the community and to establish guidelines for the physical
development of such commercial entities.

2. Specific Requirements. It is the intent of this Zone to encourage sharing of parking stalls between
uses so as to minimize the number of overall parking stalls within a development site.
a. The minimum required number of off-street parking stalls for the development site shall
be calculated based upon the interior floor area of the proposed building devoted to the
principal use or sales and shall not include area devoted to storage, kitchens, rest rooms,
break rooms, or maintenance areas (“interior Floor Area”). When there are multiple
buildings proposed for the development site, the Interior Floor Area calculated for each
building shall be added together to obtain an aggregate Interior Floor Area for the entire
development site. In this Zone the minimum average parking stall to aggregate Interior
Floor Area shall be no less than four (4.00) parking stalls per one-thousand square feet of
Interior Floor Area (4.00:1,000) for the total development site on a shared basis. All
interior subdivided parcels must have vehicular access connecting that parcel’s parking
stalls to the balance of the parking lot of the development site.
b. The owner/developer may increase the number of stalls above the minimum with the
approval of the Planning Commission.
c. In cases where less parking is appropriate, the owner/developer may reduce the number
of parking stalls below the average minimum requirement with the approval of the
Planning Commission. However, in no case shall the requirements be reduced by more
than twenty-five (25) percent.
3. Location of Parking.
a. No on-street parking shall be permitted in this Zone. No parking shall be permitted within
the minimal front, side or rear setback areas except:
b. Where a setback area abuts another District, parking may be permitted to within ten (10)
feet of the district line provided that use of such parking is limited to regular weekday
business hours.
c. Where parking within the front or side setback areas is adequately separated from public
right-of-ways with continuous landscaping at least fifteen (15) feet wide.
i. Required off-street parking shall be provided on the development site, or on an
alternate site within the same District. Where parking is provided on other than the
development site concerned, a recorded document shall be filed with the Planning
Commission and signed by the owners of the alternate site, stipulating to the
permanent reservation of use of the site for said parking. The parking setback
restrictions set forth above shall also apply to contiguous or alternate parking
sites.
ii. Parking facilities need not be located in one consolidated area of a particular site,
but may be separated by landscaping or building elements, however each phase
of a development shall provide for adequate parking.
d. A majority of parking shall be considered “interior” with buildings/structures acting as a
buffer between parking areas and the public right-of-way.

5. Landscaping of Parking Areas.
a. Where possible, siting parking areas lower than adjacent roadways and continuing street
scape grading, berms, hedges, and other landscape treatment into parking areas is
encouraged, with intent to reduce their visual impact and to screen the parking from the
adjacent roadway. All parking areas adjacent to public roadways shall require a
landscaped berm of width and height specified in Section 3-4308 of this ordinance.
b. Planter “islands” between parking bays shall be sized to provide adequate space for tree
trunks, hedges or parking lot light supports and to allow for proper maintenance.
c. Vehicles shall be prevented from overhanging into landscaped areas through extended
curbs or the use of concrete wheel stops.
6. Other Considerations.
a. Circulation within the parking areas shall provide for free flow of vehicular traffic. The
onsite parking and traffic circulation plan shall be a part of the traffic impact analysis, that
may be required as a part of the preliminary site plan review found in Section 3-4328 of
this Code.
b. Bicycle parking areas with suitable racks shall be provided in convenient locations.
Randomly strewn bicycles are not only unsightly, but can create a safety hazard. Bicycle
parking areas shall be located so to minimize conflict with pedestrian walkways.
c. Changes in occupancy or type of use, and increases in the intensity of use on any site,
after the final approval of the site plan may require changes in parking. Sufficient parking
to meet the requirements of actual tenant needs at that time shall be provided on-site.

The Purpose and intent of this Zone is to provide for various professional office, private education, and
related uses which do not deal in merchandising, retailing, warehousing or manufacturing. Further, it is
the intent of this zone to protect and buffer residential neighborhoods from retail commercial
encroachment and influence. Uses should serve as a transition between residential zones and other
more intensive uses or zones. The guidelines of this Article will serve as design criteria to developers,
builders, engineers, architects, landscape architects and other professionals in preparing plans for
construction. The City staff, the Planning Commission and the City Council will adhere to these
guidelines to review and evaluate future development projects related to Residential-Professional
development. There are certain key design elements which contribute significantly to the visual order
and consistency of the entire Residential-Professional area. These common features—site planning,
architecture, landscape design, parking, signage, lighting and other details—are the subject of this
ordinance. The guidelines express the desired character of future development. Each guideline shall be
considered in terms of how it applies to a given project. The intent of the guidelines must be met in order
for a project to be approved during the plan review process.

by Residential-Professional entities within the community and to establish guidelines for the
physical development of such Residential-Professional entities.
2. The overall intent of these regulations is to establish a standard for Residential-Professional
development and maintenance which:

(Amended: 6/17/03)
3-4503 Prohibited Uses
In the R-P Zone, any use not expressly listed as a conditional use shall be deemed prohibited.
3-4504 Development Standards
An area to be Zoned R-P shall have the following characteristics:
1. In order to encourage uses consistent with the objectives of the Residential-Professional district
and to ensure adequate site planning, the entire site must be master planned at the time of site
plan approval, even though it may be developed in stages or phases. Each phase must adhere
to the original plan except as subsequently approved by the Planning Commission and City
Council. Site must have a minimum of two-hundred (200) feet of frontage on a dedicated public
street. Control of the property by a single person, association, partnership, or corporation must
be demonstrated.
2. Although the Residential-Professional district may provide goods and/or services to citizens from
surrounding communities, it’s services should be focused primarily for the benefit of the residents
of Highland City.
3-4505 Site Coverage
Coverage regulates the area of the site that may be covered by the building. Covered walkways, roof
structure overhangs, and other solar protection or aesthetic structural elements should not be included in
building coverage calculations. These guidelines also help protect area dedicated to landscape and
parking.
1. Coverage of a site by a building structure shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total
site. This coverage may be increased, subject to the recommendation of the City Planning
Commission and/or approval by the City Council, if the project demonstrates superior response
to the Residential-Professional zoning guidelines. In no case, however, shall site coverage
exceed 35 percent.
2. When covered parking structures are provided, such structures shall not cover more than an
additional 20 percent of the ground plane.
3. In all site plan configurations, landscaping shall occupy no less than thirty-five percent (35%) of
the total land area under development.
(Amended 10/17/06)
3-4506 Building Setbacks
It shall be within the authority of the Planning Commission to determine, for any development in this
district, which property line or lines shall be considered as side or as rear lines for the purpose of
administering this ordinance.
1. No building shall be closer to a public street right-of-way than eighty (80) feet unless all parking is
provided in the rear of the building, in which case it may be no closer than thirty-five (35) feet. No
building, with the exception of any portion that contains a drive-up window or counter, shall be
closer than thirty (30) feet from any private road or driveway. Structures which are adjacent to a
plaza, mall, or other permanent pedestrian open space under the same ownership as the
structure may abut the space and have openings into it. The planning commission may reduce
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 105/321
the front yard setback to thirty (30) feet if the reduction will increase the rear yard setback
between the building and existing residential uses.
2. The public street right-of-way line shall be considered the front property line of a lot. Where a lot
is bordered on two or more sides by a public street right-of-way, all such sides shall be
considered as front property lines, and the area between the front property line and the building
lines shall be known as the front setback area in all cases. Canopies, overhangs, and similar
coverings may project into the front setback area, as much as 10', if approved by the Planning
Commission.
3. Side setback areas shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet including canopies and overhangs except
where a side property line abuts a residential district, in which case the setback area shall be a
minimum of twenty-five (25) feet.
4. Rear setback areas shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet except where a rear property line abuts a
residential district, in which case the rear setback area shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet.
(Amended: 10/17/06)
3-4507 Building Height
1. The maximum height for all buildings shall not exceed thirty (30) feet, measured from natural
grade, and no building shall be erected to a height less than ten (10) feet or one story above
grade. Where the ground or the top of the building is uneven in height, the average elevation
thereof shall apply. Maximum height shall include signs and parapets or any other projection
from the building.
2. The height requirements of this section shall apply to all commercial developments, except that
after review by the planning commission, the commission may approve, disapprove, or approve
with modifications a request for an increase in the allowable height up to thirty-six (36) feet.
3. The City Planning Commission must take into account the following criteria when a proposal for
height adjustment is requested:
a. The geographical position of the building and possible visual effects on existing structures
on or off site.
b. Potential problems on neighboring sites caused by shadows, loss of solar access, loss or
air circulation, closing of views, or ridge line intrusion.
c. The influence on the general vicinity including contact with existing buildings and
structures, streets, traffic congestion and circulation, and adjacent open space;
d. In no case will any increase in height be permitted when the effect of the height increase
is to increase the allowable square footage over that which is, or would be, possible under
normal zone standards.
3-4508 Screening Walls/Fences/Hedges
An opaque screen shall be installed and maintained along all district boundaries, other than streets.
Following are acceptable means of providing such screening:
1. Walls. A wall shall consist of stone, brick, tile, or similar type of solid masonry material (if
approved by the City Council) a minimum of eight (8) inches thick or consist of a decorative
double-sided seamless panel concrete wall, as recommended by the Planning Commission and
approved by the City Council. All such walls must be landscaped with vegetation.

detailed in Section 3-4518 of this Code.
3. No signs or sign supports shall be permitted on any required screening.
4. Notwithstanding the requirements listed above, where the finished elevation of the property is
lower at the boundary line, or within five (5) feet inside the boundary line, than an abutting
property elevation, such change in elevation may be used in lieu of, or in combination with,
additional screening to satisfy the screening requirements for this district.
5. Note. Since walls and hedges are a main visual feature in any development, regulations related
to the placement, size and appearance of such structures must be enacted. The following
standards shall apply to the installation of all fences, walls, hedges or other visual obstructions
used for the purpose of screening, either around the perimeter of the development site or within
the development site:
a. No wall, hedge or other visual obstruction in excess of six (6) feet shall be allowed on any
Residential-Professional development site, unless along a district boundary which abuts a
residential zone, in which case the height shall be eight (8) feet.
b. When there is a difference in the ground level between two adjoining lots, the height of
any fence, wall, or hedge constructed along the property line shall be determined by using
the finished grade of the highest contiguous lot.
c. Only one (1) type of fence or wall design shall be permitted on any one (1) parcel or
development. The design may include an appropriate mix of materials subject to the
guidelines of these articles and approval by the City Planning Commission.
d. The use of chain link, barbed wire, electrified fence, or razor wire fence in conjunction
with any fence, wall, or hedge, or by itself is prohibited, unless required by any law or
regulation of the State of Utah.
e. On a corner lot, no fence, wall, hedge, sign or other structure, shrubbery, mounds of
earth, or other visual obstruction over thirty-six (36) inches in height above the nearest
street curb elevation shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow within a traffic
safety sight area.
f. To protect safe sight-distance for vehicular movement, sight obstructing fences, or walls
or other obstructions shall not exceed thirty-six (36) inches in height when located in a
front setback.
g. If walls are finished in stucco, colors will be limited to earth tones. No bright or neon
colors will be allowed. If a wall has been approved by the Council that is not a decorative
wall, it shall be constructed with a stucco finish in an earthtone color.
h. All walls shall be generally natural in appearance and limited to earth toe colors. No bright
or neon colors will be allowed.
i. Any hedges used as screening shall be consistent in appearance to the general
landscape of the site. Such hedges may be geometric in shape, but shall be pruned and
maintained so as to avoid unsightly appearance and to avoid vehicular sight hazards.

b. Increase of the minimum may be required by the Planning Commission or City Council if,
in their opinion, there is an exceptional need for said increased parking.
c. In cases where less parking is appropriate, the Planning Commission may recommend
and the City Council may approve a reduced requirement based upon actual usage of
employees and customers, if the applicant has provided evidence indication that less
parking is adequate for the specifically proposed use and only if the applicant has proved
evidence and demonstrated that at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the minimum
parking requirement (3.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet) may be met without modification
to the primary structure.
i. If at some point in the future the land use changes, the properly owner may be
required to provide additional parking depending upon the specific parking
requirements for that use.
d. In cases where the category into which a use should be placed is unclear, or a use does
not conform to any of the above categories, or the use is allowed under a Conditional Use
Permit, the Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council shall determine
the appropriate category or establish a parking ratio.
e. In cases where uses occupying the same structure or within two-hundred and fifty (250)
feet of one another on the same lot or adjacent lots under the same ownership are uses

units per acre.
c. The remaining areas of the city shall have a maximum of 1.4 units per acre overall
density.
2. Property owners requesting consideration of open space bonuses shall make application and
petition, according to procedures outlined in section 3-4808, and said cost of consultant review
will be born by the applicant based upon procedures for reimbursement set forth by a resolution
of the City Council. Awards shall be based on the incorporation of elements as stated and
defined in this section. Any award of open space bonus shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and approved by the City Council.
3. Open space bonuses will be considered only on projects of twenty-five (25) acres or more.
4. Maximum area density within a development shall not exceed five detached units per acre. (If an
ordinance allowing attached housing in the Town Center is enacted by the City Council, then no
more than eight units per acre would be allowed.)
a. Any proposed development must be approved as a master plan development.
b. While abiding by the overall density of either 2.5 or 1.4 units per acre, no particular acre in
a development shall accommodate more than the maximum units allowed to meet the
densities stated in this section.
5. A minimum of 30% of the entire development shall be designated as open space to qualify for
any bonus within this ordinance.
6. To merit a bonus award, the development must demonstrate qualities and advantages beyond
what would be required of a standard residential R-1-40 development.
7. Open space bonuses shall be subject to, but not limited to, the following elements and
accompanying definitions. Cumulatively these elements may not increase residential unit
densities beyond those stated in this section.

>150 points = 0.4 units
113 points = 0.3 units
75 points = 0.2 units
38 points = 0.1 units
0 - 37 points = 0 units
Subdivisions qualifying for a density higher than .4 units to the acre will be awarded a density
based on the same ratio as above.
9. It is the intent of this ordinance to prohibit the deferral of open space and amenities through the
use of phasing.
10. Only those projects which provide 30% open space can achieve the maximum density bonus
stipulated in Section above.
11. All open space subdivisions shall be required to be a part of the Highland Open Space Special
Service District.
12. All open space provided by the developer shall be deeded to the city through a warranty deed
and title insurance.
13. All open space subdivisions shall provide internal pedestrian paths and path connections to

of the total cost of the subdivision improvements. Said amenities shall be subject to review and
approval by the city.
15. No lots shall be smaller than 14,000 sq. Ft. With a minimum average of 16,000 sq. Ft. Per phase.
16. No lots shall have less than 110' feet of frontage with an average of 120'.
17. Streets with this overlay may have a minimum of 30' of asphalt.
18. Developers of open space subdivisions that are recorded after the effective date of this
ordinance shall provide delineation between all private property lines and any proposed open
space. Requirements for delineation shall be defined as follows:
a. The delineation provided shall be per the specifications of Highland City and installed
within the public property along all property lines that abut open space or a trail.
b. Any person obtaining a building permit for a primary residence on property within an open
space subdivision after the effective date of this ordinance shall provide to the city a fee
according to the linear distance of the property line that abuts open space or a trail to
provide for delineation of the property line between private and public property (Amended
5/3/05, 5/17/05).

3-4807 Location Of Open Space
The location of open space conserved through residential development shall be consistent with the
policies contained in the Land Use Element of the General Plan and with the recommendations
contained in this section and the following section (“evaluation criteria”).
1. Open space shall be comprised of two types of land improved and natural areas. All open space
is required to be protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting future
development, and setting other standards safe-guarding the site’s special resources from
negative changes.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 195/321
a. Natural Open Space Areas. Although the locations of natural areas are pre-determined by
the locations of flood plains, wetlands, steep slopes and soils subject to slumping, greater
latitude exists in the designation of Improved Open Space Areas (except that they shall
include a 100-foot deep green way buffer along all water bodies and watercourses, and a
50-foot green way buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as “very poorly drained” in
the medium-intensity county soil survey of the USDA Natural “Resources Conservation
Service)”
b. The location of Open Space Areas shall be guided by the maps and policies contained in
the Land Use Element of the General Plan, the Parks, Recreation, and Trails Element of
the General Plan, and Parks Master Plan, and shall typically include all or part of the
following kinds of resources: mature woodlands, aquifer recharge areas with highly
permeable (“excessively drained”) soil, significant wildlife habitat areas, prime farmland,
historic, archaeological or cultural features listed (or eligible to be listed) on national state
or county registers or inventories, and scenic views into the property from existing public
roads. Open Space Areas therefore typically consist of meadows, forest, pastures and
farm fields, part of the ecologically connected matrix of natural areas significant for wildlife
habitat, water quality protection, and other reasons.
c. General Location Standards.
i. Subdivisions shall be designed around both the Natural and Improved Open
Space Areas, which together constitute the total required open space. The design
process should therefore commence with 1) the delineation of all potential open
space, 2) where potential house sites are located, 3) access road alignments are
identified, and 4) lot lines drawn in.
(1) Both Natural and Improved Areas shall be placed in undivided preserves,
which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly
to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the
development.
(2) Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practical
number of lots within a conservation subdivision. To achieve this, the
majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide
direct views and access. Safe and convenient pedestrian access to the
open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided
(except in the case of farmland, or other resource areas vulnerable to
trampling damage or human disturbance). Where the undivided open
space is designated as separate, noncontiguous parcels, no parcel shall
consist of less than three (3) acres in area nor have a length-to-width ratio
in excess of 4 to 1, except in areas that are specifically designed as village
greens, ballfields, upland buffers to wetlands, waterbodies, buffers,
watercourses, or trail links.
d. Interconnected Open Space Network.
e. As these policies are implemented, the protected open spaces in each new subdivision
will eventually adjoin each other, ultimately forming an interconnected network of Natural
and Open Space Areas across the City.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 196/321
f. Evaluation Criteria.
i. In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be
considered by the Planning Commission as indicating design appropriate to the
site’s natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this
ordinance. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the
best possible relationship between development and open space areas.
Accordingly, the Planning Commission shall evaluate proposals to determine
whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan:
(1) Protects and serves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from
clearing, grading, filing, or construction (except as may be approved by the
City for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities).
(2) Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures,
meadows and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize
conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating
house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended,
with two exceptions. The first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature
woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern as
described in items below. The second involves predominantly agricultural
areas, where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife
habitat.
(3) If development is to be located on open fields or pastures because of
greater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited
on the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a field,
as seen from existing public roads. Other considerations include whether
the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads, such
as by planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees,
shrubs, and wildflowers (specifications for which should be based upon a
close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found
in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow).
(4) Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural species vegetation of at
least 50 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including
creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds.
(5) Designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or
meadows and minimize impacts on large woodlands (greater than five
acres), especially those containing many mature trees or significant wildlife
habitat. Also, woodlands of any size or highly erodible soils with slopes
greater than 10% should be avoided. However, woodlands in poor
condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations
for residential development. When any woodland is developed, great care
shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards,
septic disposal fields, etc.) In locations where there are no large trees or
obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 197/321
(6) Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as
seen from public thoroughfares. For example, in open space agrarian
landscapes, a deep “no-build, no-plant” buffer is recommended along the
public thoroughfare where those views or vistas are prominent or locally
significant. The concept of “foreground meadows” with homes facing the
public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse is strongly preferred to
mere buffer strips, with or without berms or vegetative screening. In
wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be
maintained, a deep “no-build, no-cut” buffer should be respected, to
preserve existing vegetation.
(7) Avoid siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking
advantage of lower topographic features.
(8) Protect wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened,
or of special concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
Utah State Division of Wildlife.
(9) Designs around and preserve sites of historic, archaeological, or cultural
values, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of
the feature, such as stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar
holes, earthworks, and burial grounds.
(10) Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular
carrying capacity by discouraging development from coming directly onto
existing public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of
rural roads with historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerow, and so on.
(11) Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac
islands, and both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and
flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value. Deciduous shade
trees shall be planted at thirty-foot intervals on both side of each street or
equivalent, so that the neighborhood will have a stately and traditional
appearance when they grow and mature. These trees shall generally be
located between the sidewalk or foot path and the edge of the street, within
a planting strip no less than five feet in width.
(12) Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer
convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby
house lots.
(13) Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that
pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and
activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system.
All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn
should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or
with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where
applicable).
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_3_Zoning_-_General_Requirements 198/321
(14) Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous. Fragmentation of open
space should be minimized so that those resource areas are not divided
into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development.
To the greatest extent practicable, this land shall be designed as a single
block with logical, straight forward boundaries. Long thin strips of
conservation land should be avoided, unless the conservation feature is
linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other
streams or trails. The open space shall generally abut existing or potential
open space land on adjacent parcels (such as in other subdivisions, public
parks, or properties owned by or leased to private land conservation
organizations). Such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of
larger contiguous greenway systems, as per the policies of the Land Use
Element of the General Plan and the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element
of the General Plan.
(Adopted: 5/18/99)

The design guidelines provided herein for the Professional Office (“P.O.”) Zone has been devised as a
method of achieving a high quality, cohesive design for professional office development in Highland City.
These guidelines will serve as design criteria to developers, builders, engineers, architects, landscape
architects and other professionals in preparing plans for construction. In addition, these articles will lend
guidance to staff, the Planning Commission and the City Council in the review and evaluation of future
development projects related to professional office development. There are certain key design elements
which contribute significantly to the visual order and consistency of the entire professional office area.
These common features--site planning, architecture, landscape design, parking, signage, lighting and
other details--are the subject of this ordinance. The guidelines express the desired character of future
development. Each guideline shall be considered in terms of how it applies to a given project. The intent
of the guidelines must be met in order for a project to be approved during the plan review process. All of
the above must be consistent with the Site Plan attached hereto as Exhibit “A”, the Landscape Plan
attached hereto as Exhibit “B”, and the Architectural Details, attached hereto as Exhibit “C”.
1. The purpose of this ordinance is to define a range of goods and services which may be offered
by professional and service entities within the community and to establish guidelines for the
physical development of such professional and service entities.

buildings, storage facilities, accompanying substructures, and surrounding landscape;
b. Promotes architecture with a residential flavor;
c. Promotes development which works in harmony with the open, rural atmosphere of
Highland City;
d. Prevents the erection of buildings or substructures with an industrial or a pre-fabricated
appearance; and,
e. Allows some flexibility of architecture so as to encourage creativity of design.
f. Promotes the successful completion of the project and of the ability of professional and
service entities to succeed by carefully reviewing financial statements and character
references of developers, builders and users submitted to the Planning Commission.

whole, however, the use of too many exterior materials, like excessive ornamentation,
detracts from the values of adjoining properties. Exterior walls of any building may be
sided with up to three different materials per building, but no more than three materials
may appear on any one wall, including ornamental siding. Trim shall not be counted as a
siding material. If trim covers more than 10% of a side of the building, it shall be counted
as a siding material on that side.

3-41001 Purpose And Intent
The Public Utility Zone has been established as a Zone in which the primary use of land is for public
utilities such as power substations, water storage tanks and reservoirs. The Zone has as its main
objectives the architectural control, protection of existing residential property rights and utility master
planning for the future of Highland City. Any proposed use within a Public Utility Zone that is contiguous
to a residential zone may not be approved if the proposed use is proven to create negative impact to the
health and safety of existing residences. The City staff, the Planning Commission and the City Council
will adhere to these guidelines to review and evaluate future development projects related to
development within Public Utility zones. There are certain key design elements which contribute
significantly to the visual order and consistency of Highland City. These common features—site
planning, architecture, landscape design, parking, signage, lighting and other details—are the subject of
this ordinance. The guidelines express the desired character of future development. Each guideline shall
be considered in terms of how it applies to a given project. The intent of the guidelines must be met in
order for a project to be approved during the plan review process.
1. The purpose of this ordinance is to define a range of services which may be offered by public
utilities within the community and to establish guidelines for the physical development of above
ground structures providing public utilities.

2. The overall intent of these regulations is to establish a standard for development and
maintenance of public utilities which:
a. Promote the overall functionality, safety and visual attractiveness of public utility buildings,
accompanying substructures, and surrounding landscape;
b. Promote architecture with a residential flavor;
c. Promote development which works in harmony with the open, rural atmosphere of
Highland City;
d. Prevent the erection of buildings or substructures with an industrial or pre-fabricated
appearance.
(Adopted 6/1/01)
3-41002 Conditional Uses
The only uses allowed within the P-U Zone shall be Conditional Uses which satisfy the primary intent or
purpose for the Zone and which are subject to special conditions as may be imposed by the Planning
Commission or City Council. All such conditional uses may be subject to additional conditions
considered appropriate and necessary by the Planning Commission and City Council. Those uses which
are incompatible with the desired land use for the P-U Zone are prohibited. Any associated structure(s)
requested within this zone shall be uninhabitable with the exception of routine maintenance. The
following list of uses may be permitted within the Public Utility Zone with a Conditional Use permit:
1. Water Storage Tanks

2. In order to encourage uses consistent with the objectives of the Public Utility Zone and to ensure
adequate site planning, the entire site must be master planned at the time of site plan approval.
Control of the property by a single person, association, partnership, or corporation must be
demonstrated.
3. A facility located within the Public Utility Zone may provide services to citizens from surrounding
communities including any above-ground device or structure, of a culinary water, irrigation,
reservoir, or private utility system not owned or operated by Highland City, which is intended to
regulate the function of a storage device or distribution line or which receives or transmits a
signal.

3-41005 Site Coverage
Coverage regulates the area of the site that may be covered by the building. Covered walkways, roof
structure overhangs, and other solar protection or aesthetic structural elements should not be included in
building coverage calculations. These guidelines also help protect area dedicated to landscape and
parking.
Coverage of a site by a building structure, including all the pertinences, shall not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total site. This coverage may be increased, subject to the approval of the City
Planning Commission, if the project demonstrates superior response to the Public Utility zoning
guidelines. In no case, however, shall site coverage exceed 35 percent (35%).

Zone, which property line or lines shall be considered as side or as rear lines for the purpose of
administering this ordinance.
1. The public street right-of-way line shall be considered the front property line of a lot. Where a
property does not have frontage on a public right-of-way then the front shall be considered the
portion of the lot where it is accessed. Front setback areas shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet.
2. Side setback areas shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet. Where a side property line abuts a
residential zone then the side setback shall be a minimum of (25) feet.
3. Rear setback areas shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet. Where a rear property line abuts a
residential zone then the rear setback shall be a minimum of (25) feet.
4. In no case shall any permanent structure be constructed within any recorded easement of any
kind. This shall include retaining walls over two (2) feet in height, but shall exclude fences which
meet the fence requirements of Highland City.
5. Setbacks do not apply to open ponds for water storage, however open ponds shall not be
developed within any easement other than drainage basins or easements designated for such
use.

6. Expiration. Approval of any PD zoning is conditioned on development of the first phase of the
project commencing within two years of the effective date of the ordinance approving the PD
zoning on the property.
a. Prior to the expiration of the two year time condition, the property owner or authorized
representative may submit an application for an extension to the City. Upon receipt of a
request for extension, the Zoning Administrator shall submit the request to the City
Council for consideration at a public hearing held pursuant to 603.D.2 below
b. The City Council shall, after notices via certified mail to the property owner and authorized
representative have been provided at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the
scheduled hearing, hold a public hearing on the extension request. The City Council may,
in its sole discretion, grant one extension of the time condition up to one-year.
c. In the event the project’s first phase has not commenced within the two year time period
and no request for time extension has been received the Zoning Administrator may
submit the PD to the City Council for consideration of reversion, pursuant to the hearing
procedure set forth in below:
i. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the property owner and authorized
representative by certified mail of the City Council’s intention to hold a hearing to
determine compliance with the two year time condition, and to revert the zoning on
the property to its former classification if the condition is determined by the City
Council to have not been met. All such notices shall be made at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. The City Council may, in its sole
discretion, either grant an extension of the time condition or revert the zoning on
the property to its prior zoning classification.

shall monitor the project to ensure compliance with the approved PD phasing schedule.
Upon the Zoning Administrator’s initial determination that the phasing schedule is not
being met, no further review or approval of any project site plan or plat shall occur until it
is determined that good cause exists for delay in the construction of the project. Should
the project fail to proceed as scheduled, a public hearing shall be held by the City Council
to determine the cause of the delay. At the public hearing on the matter, if the City
Council determines that there is not good cause for the delay, it may impose additional
conditions on the PD to ensure compliance with the phasing schedule. If such additional
conditions and the phasing schedule are not met, the Zoning Administrator may set the
matter for public hearing, according to the process set forth above, on a possible
reversion of the PD zoning. If the City Council determines that good cause exists, it may
amend the PD development phasing schedule.
e. For purposes of this section, the terms “commence,” “commencing” and commencement”
shall mean physical vertical construction activity in accordance with a valid building permit
issued by the City and/or the beginning of construction of on-site and off-site
infrastructure including streets, sidewalks, water and wastewater, so long as such
infrastructure is completed prior to expiration of the City-issued development permit
issued therefore.

This Section shall permit a business within a commercial zone to apply for a permit to install a
permanent wall sign upon their place of business in Highland City (see wall sign definition within this
Section). A wall sign shall be installed by a licensed sign contractor* for a commercial business if the
following requirements are met (additional requirements may apply within separate zones B see above
Table 3-707A). The applicant shall be the owner of the business for which the sign will be installed or a
licensed sign contractor representing the said owner. All wall signs within commercial zones of a sign
type that has not been previously approved shall require specific approval by the Highland City Planning
Commission. The following restrictions shall apply to all wall signs:
1. Location.
a. Wall signs are allowed only on the exterior elevation of the space occupied by the
business.
b. A wall sign shall be affixed parallel to a permanent part of the exterior of a building and
shall project less than 18 inches from that wall.
c. Wall signs shall be centered horizontally and vertically within the architectural frontage
and located over the tenant space. The overall length of any sign shall not exceed 80% of
the architectural frontage on which it is placed. The overall height shall not exceed 70% of
the narrowest portion of the vertical fascia height on which it is placed.
Wall Sign Location Examples:
d. A minimum of 3” line spacing shall be used between all multiple lines.
e. A wall sign may never extend above the eave, horizontal roof line or roof parapet or
located within twelve (12) inches from the eave or parapet.

g. Wall signs are prohibited on Rear or side elevations adjacent to single family residential
uses.
2. Size. The size of the wall sign is calculated by the building frontage from which the applicant for
the wall sign operates business. A wall sign is calculated by a percentage of the front wall of the
business from eave or cornice to grade multiplied by the linear foot of building width or width of
leased space whichever is less.
3. Sign Area. The sign area for each business shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of façade of the
business wall elevation along the street frontage on which the sign is displayed. In no event shall

a. Signs shall be either individual pan channel letters and logos; reverse pan channel letters
and logos, or custom cabinets.
b. Wall signs may incorporate an insignia, business logo or registered trademark as a
cabinet type sign. Only 20% of the sign size shall be permitted to be the insignia,
business logo or registered trademark as a cabinet type sign.
c. Wall signs shall be designed to be consistent with a sign theme for each commercial
development project. If a sign theme has not been officially established, then all signs
shall be consistent with the majority of the existing signs within an existing development
project.
d. Signs shall be individually mounted. Raceways are prohibited except on existing buildings
with existing raceways.
5. Lighting. A wall sign shall be internally illuminated from within the individual letters, down-lighted
by an architecturally significant fixture(s), or may be installed without lighting. All wall sign lighting

utility companies, both private and public, so that the extension of community facilities and
utilities may be accomplished in an orderly manner, coordinated with the development of the
subdivision. In order to facilitate the acquisition of land areas required to implement this policy,
the subdivider may be required to dedicate, grant easements over or otherwise reserve land for
schools, parks, playgrounds, public ways, utility easements, and other public purposes as
specified.
4. Subdivision Plats which incorporate areas which in the judgment of the City Council include land
features which are either environmentally or historically unique and which if modified would alter
the nature and character of the community in an adverse manner, may be defined as either
Public or Private Conservation Areas. The Conservation area may include natural water courses,
old growth wooded areas, unique land features, and natural historical landmarks, which make a
material contribution to the nature and character of the community. The City Council, with the
advise of the Planning Commission, shall insure that the conservation area is protected by deed
restrictions, conservation easements, subdivision CCR’s or public dedications (or a combination
of these) as the City Council may deem appropriate. Documents necessary to create and protect
the conservation area must be recorded at the time of subdivision plat recording.

5-4-322 Recording Of Plat
After City Council approval, completion of the required public improvements or filing of the bond
agreement described in Section 5-4-318, above, and Chapter 6, Guarantee of Performance, in this
Code, satisfaction of all other city requirements, and signing of the plat by the Mayor, the plat, and
covenants, conditions and restrictions for the subdivision shall be presented by the City Recorder to the
Utah County Recorder for recordation.
(Amended 5/20/08)
5-4-323 Expiration Of Final Plat Approval
If the requirements set forth in the subdivision approval above are not met by the subdivider within 180
calendar days from the date of City Council approval, such approval shall be null and void. This time
period may be extended by the Zoning Administrator one time, for up to 180 days if the subdivider
petitions the Zoning Administrator for an extension prior to the expiration date and pays extension fees.
The Zoning Administrator shall not grant a subdivision extension if: the subdivision no longer meets
current zoning ordinances; surrounding property has received final approval and/or has developed
resulting in new alignments, development requirements, or similar; geological or geophysical conditions
have changed or been identified; the proposal has changed since the previously approved Final
Approval. One additional extension request for City Council Final Approval may be submitted to the City
Council directly for approval and after payment of extension fees for the second extension request. The
subdivider must petition for an extension, prior to the expiration of the original 180 day period and pay
extension fees. An extension may be granted only if the City Council finds that it will not be detrimental
to the City and if the planned uses have not changed. The City Council shall not grant a subdivision
extension if the subdivision no longer meets current zoning ordinances. The City Council may not grant
a subdivision extension if the surrounding property has received final approval and/or has developed
resulting in new alignments, development requirements, or similar; or, geological or geophysical
conditions have changed or been identified. If any of the fees charged as a condition of subdivision
approval, including but not limited to, inspection fees, parks fee, flood control fees, impact fees as well
as the amounts the City uses to estimate bonds to insure completion of improvements, have increased,
the City Council shall require that the subdivider pay such increases as a condition of granting the
extension.

5-4-409 Ownership And Maintenance Of Open Space
5-4-401 Purpose
This provision is intended to promote imaginative, well designed subdivisions, which preserve and
encourage the donation of open space and respect the physical qualities of the land. The Planning
Commission may recommend and The City Council approve Open Space Subdivisions in the R-1-40
zone and in the R-1-20 zone, provided the following conditions are met:
5-4-402 Land Area
In instances where there is a compelling community interest clustering may be required. Examples of
compelling community interest could include:
1. Natural Areas
2. Wetlands
3. Wildlife Habitat
4. Scenic Corridors
5. Gateways
6. Other Public Use Lands
5-4-403 Density: Number Of Lots
The maximum number of lots to be permitted on subdivided property is determined by dividing the total
plat square footage by forty thousand square feet, in the R-1-40 zone and dividing by twenty thousand
square feet in the R-1-20 zone.
5-4-404 Permitted Uses
5-4-405 Minimum Lot Area
In open space subdivisions, the minimum lot area be determined after an evaluation of:
1. All potential conservation areas
2. The location of the housing sites
3. The alignment of streets and trails.
4. The drawing of lot lines
5. The open space shall be computed based upon the difference between the square footage of the
lots and the total square footage of the subdivision
5-4-406 Minimum Percentage Of Open Space
The minimum percentage of land that shall be designated as permanent open space, not to be further
subdivided, and protected through a conservation easement held by Highland City or by a recognized
land trust or conservancy shall be specified below:
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 19/50
1. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the total tract area, after deducting the following kinds of
unbuildable land (which are also required to be deducted when calculating net permitted density
for conventional subdivisions as well):
a. Wetlands and land that is generally inundated (land under ponds, lakes, creeks, etc.)
b. All of the floodway and floodway fringe within the 100-year floodplain, as shown on official
FEMA maps.
c. Land with slopes exceeding 25%, or soils subject to slumping.
d. Land required for street rights-of-way (10% of the net tract area)
e. Land under permanent easement prohibiting future development (including easements for
drainage, access, and utilities)
f. The above shall generally be designated as undivided open space, to facilitate easement
monitoring and enforcement, and to promote appropriate management by a single entity
according to approved land management standards.
2. All undivided open space and any lot capable of further subdivision shall be restricted from
further subdivision through a permanent conservation easement, in a form acceptable to the
township and duly recorded in the County Recorder’s Office.
3. At least twenty-five (25%) of the minimum required open space shall be suitable for active
recreation purposes, but no more than fifty percent (50%) shall be utilized for that purpose, in
order to preserve a reasonable proportion natural areas on the site. The purpose for which open
space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant.
4. Storm water management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required
open space, as may land within the rights-of-way for underground pipelines. However, land
within the rights-of-way of high-tension power lines shall not be included as comprising part of
the minimum required open space.
5-4-407 Location Of Open Space
The location of open space conserved through compact residential development shall be consistent with
the policies contained in the Land Use Element of the General Plan and with the recommendations
contained in this section and the following section (“evaluation criteria”).
1. Open space shall be comprised of two types of land: “Primary Conservation Areas” and
“Secondary Conservation areas”. All lands within both Primary and Secondary Conservation
areas are required to be protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting future
development, and setting other standards safe-guarding the site’s special resources from
negative changes.
a. Primary Conservation areas. This category consists of wetlands, lands that are generally
inundated (under ponds, lakes, creeks, etc.), land within the 100-year floodplain, slopes
exceeding 25%, and soils subject to slumping. These sensitive lands are deducted from
the total parcel acreage to produce the “adjusted Tract Acreage,” on which density is
based (for both conventional and conservation subdivisions).
b. Secondary Conservation areas. In addition to the Primary Conservation Areas, at least
fifty percent (50%) of the remaining land shall be designated and permanently protected.
Full density credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be
buildable under local, state and federal regulations, so that their development potential is
not reduced by this designation. Such density credit may be applied to other
unconstrained parts of the site.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 20/50
c. Although the locations of Primary Conservation Areas are pre-determined by the locations
of flood plains, wetlands, steep slopes an soils subject to slumping, greater latitude exists
in the designation of Secondary Conservation Areas (except that they shall include a 100-
foot deep green way buffer along all water bodies and watercourses, and a 50-foot green
way buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as “very poorly drained” in the mediumintensity
county soil survey of the USDA Natural “Resources Conservation Service)”
d. The location of Secondary Conservation Areas shall be guided by the maps and policies
contained in the Land Use Element of the General Plan and the Parks, Recreation and
Trails Element of the General Plan and shall typically include all or part of the following
kinds of resources: mature woodlands, aquifer recharge areas with highly permeable
(“excessively drained”) soil, significant wildlife habitat areas, prime farmland, historic,
archaeological or cultural features listed (or eligible to be listed) on national state or
county registers or inventories, and scenic views into the property from existing public
roads. Secondary Conservation Areas therefore typically consist of meadows, forest,
pastures and farm fields, part of the ecologically connected matrix of natural areas
significant for wildlife habitat, water quality protection, and other reasons. Although the
resource lands listed as potential Secondary Conservation Areas may comprise more
than half of the remaining land on a development parcel (after primary conservation areas
have been deducted), no applicant shall be required to designate more than 50% of that
remaining land as Secondary Conservation Area.
e. General Location Standards.
i. Subdivisions shall be designed around both the Primary and Secondary
Conservation Areas, which together constitute the total required open space. The
design process should therefore commence with the delineation of all potential
open space, after which potential house sites are located. Following that, access
road alignments are identified, with lot lines being drawn in as the final step. This
“four-step” process in further described in Section II.b.6 below.
ii. Both Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas shall be placed in undivided
preserves, which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more
compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of
the development.
iii. Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable
number of lots within a conservation subdivision. To achieve this, the majority of
house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and
access. Safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not
adjoining the open space shall be provided (except in the case of farmland, or
other resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance).
Where the undivided open space is designated as separate, noncontiguous
parcels, no parcel shall consist of less than three (3) acres in area nor have a
length-to-width ratio in excess of 4 to 1, except in areas that are specifically
designed as village greens, ballfields, upland buffers to wetlands, waterbodies or
watercourses or trail links.

f. Interconnected Open Space Network.
i. As these policies are implemented, the protected open spaces in each new
subdivision will eventually adjoin each other, ultimately forming an interconnected
network of Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas across the City. To avoid
the issue of “taking of land without compensation” the only elements of this
network that would necessarily be open to the public are those lands that have
been required to be dedicated for public use, never more than 10% of a
development parcel’s gross acreage, and typically configured in a linear fashion
as an element of the City’s long range open space network.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 22/50
g. Evaluation Criteria.
i. In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be
considered by the Planning Commission as indicating design appropriate to the
site’s natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this
ordinance. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the
best possible relationship between development and conservation areas.
Accordingly, the Planning Commission shall evaluate proposals to determine
whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan:
ii. Protects and serves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing,
grading, filing, or construction (except as may be approved by the City for
essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities).
iii. Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows
and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between
residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating house lots and driveways
within wooded areas is generally recommended, with two exceptions. The first
involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or
greater preservation concern as described in items #5 and #8 below. The second
involves predominantly agricultural areas, where remnant tree groups provide the
only natural areas for wildlife habitat.
iv. If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater
constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least
prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a field, as seen from
existing public roads. Other considerations include whether the development will
be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by planting screen
consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers
(specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the
distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside
verge or hedgerow).
v. Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural species vegetation of at least 100
feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams,
springs, lakes and ponds.
vi. Designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows and
minimize impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres), especially those
containing many mature trees or significant wildlife habitat. Also, woodlands of any
size or highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10% should be avoided.
However, woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can
provide suitable locations for residential development. When any woodland is
developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings,
roads, yards, septic disposal fields, etc.) In locations where there are no large
trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable.
vii. Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen
from public thoroughfares. For example, in open space agrarian landscapes, a
deep “no-build, no-plant” buffer is recommended along the public thoroughfare
where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant. The concept of
“foreground meadows” with homes facing the pubic thoroughfare across a broad
grassy expanse is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips, with or without berms or
vegetative screening. In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature
that should be maintained, a deep “no-build, no-cut” buffer should be respected, to
preserve existing vegetation.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 23/50
viii. Avoid siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking advantage
of lower topographic features.
ix. Protect wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of
special concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Utah State
Division of Wildlife.
x. Designs around and preserve sites of historic, archaeological, or cultural values,
and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature,
including stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar holes, earthworks,
and burial grounds.
xi. Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular
carrying capacity by avoiding development from coming directly onto existing
public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with
historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerow, and so on.
xii. Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac islands, and
both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with
high wildlife conservation value. Deciduous shade trees shall be planted at fortyfoot
intervals on both side of each street, so that the neighborhood will have a
stately and traditional appearance when they grow and mature. These trees shall
generally be located between the sidewalk or foot path and the edge of the street,
within a planting strip no less than five feet in width.
xiii. Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer convenient
access by residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots.
xiv. Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can
walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special
features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside footpaths
should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential open
space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open space on adjoining
developed parcels, where applicable).
xv. Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous. Fragmentation of open space
should be minimized so that those resource areas are not divided into numerous
small parcels located in various parts of the development. To the greatest extent
practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with logical,
straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land should be
avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is
necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open space shall generally
abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels (such as in other
subdivisions, public parks, or properties owned by or leased to private land
conservation organizations). Such subdivision open space shall be designed as
part of larger contiguous greenway systems, as per the policies of the Land Use
Element of the General Plan and the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element of the
General Plan.
5-4-408 Site Planning Procedures
The sequence of actions prescribed for Open Space Subdivisions will follow the major subdivision
section of this code as outlined in Section 5-4-300. Reviews specific to Conservation Subdivisions are
noted below.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 24/50
1. Pre-Application Discussion.
a. A pre-application discussion is strongly encouraged between the applicant, the site
designer(s), and the Planning Commission. The purpose of this informal meeting is to
introduce the applicant and the site designer(s) to the City’s zoning and subdivision
regulations and procedures, and to discuss the applicant’s objectives in relation to the
City’s official policies and ordinance requirement. The City may designate a consultant
experienced in development design and in the protection of natural features and
greenway lands to meet with the applicant and to attend or conduct meeting required
under this ordinance. (The cost of these consultant fees shall be paid for through
subdivision review fees received by the City.)
i. Existing Features (Site Analysis) or Sketch Plan. Plans analyzing each site’s
special features are required for all proposed subdivisions, as they form the basis
of the design process for greenway lands, house locations, street alignments, and
lot lines. The applicant or his/her representative shall bring a copy of the Existing
Features (Site Analysis) Plan to the on-site walkabout. Requirements for Existing
Features (Site Analysis) Plans are as follows:
(1) A contour map based at least upon topographical maps published by the
U.S. Geological Survey.
(2) The location of severely constraining elements such as steep slopes (over
25%), wetlands, watercourses, intermittent streams and 100-year flood
plains and all rights of ways and easements.
(3) Soil boundaries as shown on the USDA Natural Resources Conservation
Service medium density maps.
(4) The location of significant features such as woodlands, treelines, open
fields or meadows, scenic views into or out from the property, watershed
divides and drainage ways, fences or stone walls, rock outcrops, and
existing structures, roads, tracks and trails.
(5) These Existing Features (Site Analysis) Plans shall identify both Primary
Conservation Areas (flood plains, wetlands, and steep slopes), and
Secondary Conservation Areas. ordinance. Together, these primary and
secondary Conservation areas comprise the development’s proposed open
space, the location of which shall be consistent with the locational design
criteria listed in the Land Use Element of the General Plan and the Parks,
Recreation and Trails Element of the General Plan. The Existing Features
(Site Analysis) Plan shall form the basis for the sketch plan, which shall
show the tentative location of homes, streets, lot lines, and greenway lands
in new subdivisions, according to the four-step design process described in
Section II.b6 below.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 25/50
2. On-Site Walkabout.
a. After the Existing Features (Site Analysis) Plan has been prepared, the Planning
Commission may schedule a mutually convenient date to walk the property with the
applicant and his/her site designer. The purpose of this visit is to familiarize City officials
with the property’s special features, and to provide them an informal opportunity to offer
guidance (or a least a response) to the applicant regarding the tentative location of the
Secondary Conservation Areas and potential house locations and street alignments. If
this visit is not scheduled before submission of the sketch plan, it should occur soon
thereafter.
3. Pre-submission Conference.
a. Prior to submission of the sketch plan, the applicant shall meet with the City Staff to
discuss how the four-step approach to designing subdivisions, described, could be
applied to the subject property. At the discretion of the Staff, this conference may be
combined with the on-site walkabout;

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 26/50
4. Preliminary Plan (Amended 11/15/05, 5/2/06, 10/7/08)
a. After the pre-submission conference, a preliminary Plan shall be submitted to the city and
the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing for all proposed subdivisions. The
applicant shall provide a legible vicinity map indicating the exact location of their property
and each property within ¼ mile (1,320 feet). The map shall include the address of the
subject property and shall be part of each notice required for the public hearing. As used
in this ordinance, the term “preliminary plan” refers to a preliminarily engineered plan
drawn to illustrate thoughts about a layout for greenway lands, house sites, and street
alignments. This is the stage where drawings are tentatively illustrated, before heavy
engineering costs are incurred in the design of any proposed subdivision layout. These
drawings shall be prepared by a team that includes a landscape architect and a civil
engineer.
b. A Preliminary Plan shall be submitted by the applicant to the City in accordance with
Section 3-4-100 of the City Development Code. The Planning Commission review will
include overall pattern of streets, house lots, Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas,
and potential trail linkages (where applicable), prior to any significant expenditure of
engineering cost in the design of streets, storm water management, or the accurate
delineation of lot boundaries.
c. Application for Final Plan approval shall be made to the Planning Commission within 180
calendar days after conditional approval of the Preliminary Plan by the Planning
Commission. This time period may be extended by the City Zoning Administrator for up to
180 calendar days if the subdivider petitions the City for an extension prior to the
expiration date and pays extension fees. The Zoning Administrator shall not grant a
subdivision extension if: the subdivision no longer meets current zoning ordinances;
surrounding property has received final approval and/or has developed resulting in new
alignments, development requirements, or similar; geological or geophysical conditions
have changed or been identified; the proposal has changed since the initial Preliminary
Approval and Final Recommendation. Extension requests for the Planning Commission
Final Recommendation after the first extension has been granted shall be submitted to
the Planning Commission directly for approval and after payment of extension fees. The
applicant shall satisfy all conditions of approval as required by staff and approved by the
Planning Commission prior to submitting for Final Plan approval. Any changes to the
Preliminary Plan as required by staff and approved by the Planning Commission shall be
included on the Final Plan prior to submitting for Final Subdivision Plan recommendation
from the Planning Commission. Staff shall be given adequate time to review any of these
requirements/ changes before permitting the applicant to apply for final plat approval.
d. The subdivider shall file an application for Final Subdivision Plan recommendation from
the Planning Commission with the Zoning Administrator on a form prescribed by the City,
together with such prints and data as may be required from time to time by the Zoning
Administrator.

5. Four-Step Process.
a. Each Preliminary Plan shall follow a four-step design process, as described below.
i. Designating the Open Space. During the first step, all potential conservation areas
(both primary and secondary) are identified, using the Existing Features (Site
Analysis) Plan. Primary conservation Areas shall consist of wetlands, floodplains,
slopes over 25%, and soils susceptible to slumping. Secondary Conservation
Areas shall comprise 50% of the remaining land, and shall include the most
sensitive and noteworthy natural, scenic, and cultural resources on that remaining
half of the property.
ii. Guidance on which parts of the remaining land to classify as Secondary
Conservation Areas shall be based upon.
(1) On-site visits or “walkabouts”
(2) The open space locational criteria contained in Section 1.e. above
(3) Information from published data and reports
(4) Conversations with existing or recent owners of the property, and members
or the Planning Commission and City Council.
iii. Location of house sites. During the second step, potential house sites are
tentatively located. Because the proposed location of houses within each lot
represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the
development to meet the evaluation criteria, subdivision applicants shall identify
tentative house sites on the Preliminary Plan and proposed house sites on the
detailed final plan. House sites should generally be located not closer than 100
feet of Primary Conservation Areas, but may be situated within 50 feet of
Secondary Conservation areas, but may be situated within 50 feet of Secondary
Conservation Areas, in order to enjoy views of the latter without negatively
impacting the former. The building “footprint” of proposed residences may be
changed by more than fifty feet in any direction with approval of the Planning
Commission. Changes involving less than fifty feet do not require approval.
iv. Street and Lot layout. The third step consists of aligning proposed streets to
provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economical
way. When lots and access streets are laid out, they shall be located in a way that
avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on both the Primary and Secondary
Conservation Areas. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossings and
streets traversing existing slopes over 15% shall be strongly discouraged. Street
connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-desacs
to be maintained by the City and to facilitate easy access to and from homes
in different parts of the property (and adjoining parcels). Where cul-de-sacs
serving more than six homes shall generally be designed with a central island
containing indigenous trees and shrubs (either conserved on site or planted).
v. The City generally encourages the creation of single-loaded residential access
streets, in order that the maximum number of homes in new developments may
enjoy views of open space.
vi. Note than in situations where more formal “neo-traditional” or “village type” layouts
are proposed, Steps two and three may be reversed, so that the location of house
sites follows the location of streets and squares.

3. The following principles shall govern street names in a subdivision:
a. Each street which is a continuation of, or an approximate continuation of, any existing
dedicated street shall be given the name of such existing street. When any street forms a
portion of a proposed street previously ordered by the City Council to be surveyed,
opened, widened or improved, the street shall be given the name established in said
Council order.
b. The names of newly created streets of a non-continuous or noncontiguous nature shall
not duplicate or nearly duplicate the name of any streets in the City or in unincorporated
areas of Utah County.
c. The words "Street," "Avenue," "Boulevard," "Place," "Way," "Court," or other designation
of any street shall be spelled out in full on the plat and shall be subject to approval by the
Planning Commission. Any named street shall also have the proper south or west
coordinate as approved by the City Engineer.
4. Street patterns in the subdivision shall be in conformity with the plan for the most advantageous
development of adjoining areas and the entire neighborhood or district. The following principles
shall be observed:
a. Where appropriate to the design and terrain, proposed streets shall be contiguous and in
alignment with existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect.
b. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land to be subdivided,
unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission, such extension is not desirable for the coordination of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
c. Dead-end streets, intended as access to future development parcels, shall be a maximum
of one lot depth in length. With Planning Commission approval, any dead-end street
longer than one lot depth shall have a minimum of a 40-foot radius temporary turnaround
area with an all-weather surface and shall not exceed 600 feet in length. Any street
exceeding 600 feet shall have at least two points of independent access.
d. Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as topography and
other limiting factors of good design permit. "T" intersections rather than "cross"
intersections shall be used wherever possible for local streets.
e. Excessively long and straight connecting local residential streets, conducive to high
speed traffic, shall be prohibited according to the Planning Commission's judgment.
f. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential subdivisions except when approved for access
to lots abutting an arterial. Alleys in nonresidential subdivisions may be permitted.
g. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 600 feet in length and shall have a minimum terminal radius
of 50 feet. Driveways, mailboxes, fire hydrants, or any other obstruction to the terminal of
a cul-de-sac shall be designed in such a way as to provide an area for the piling of snow.
h. Homes shall face local residential streets. It is not desirable to have lots with road
frontage on front and back unless one is an arterial or major collector and proper
screening is used.

5. Subdivisions adjacent to arterials and freeways shall be designed as specified in the major street
plan and as determined by the Planning Commission. The following principles and standards
shall be observed:
a. Street design shall have the purpose of making adjacent lots, if for residential use,
desirable for such use by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic and of minimizing the
interference with traffic on an arterial. The number of intersecting streets along an arterial
shall be held to a minimum.
b. A landscaped pedestrian way along arterial streets shall be not less than twenty feet in
width measured from top back of curb and at least five feet of landscaped planter shall be
located between the curb and sidewalk. A meandering sidewalk shall not be less than five
feet in width.
c. Design of lots abutting arterial streets shall conform to one of the following alternatives:
i. Lots may be platted along a frontage street which is separated from the arterial
street by at least 10 feet of permanent landscaping, subject to approval by the
Planning Commission. Frontage roads shall enter arterial by means of
intersections designed with turning and stacking capacity adequate for the traffic
volume as estimated by the Planning Commission.
ii. Double frontage lots shall be platted with a minimum depth of 110 feet and a
minimum width of 75 feet. In cases where homes are sited on double frontage lots
with the rear yard adjacent to the arterial, a concrete or masonry wall shall be
constructed abutting the sidewalk. Access shall not be allowed from double
frontage lots directly onto arterial streets. Accessory buildings shall not be allowed
within 25 feet of any dedicated street in a residential zone.
iii. Lots may be platted on cul-de-sacs extending toward an arterial from a minor
collector within the subdivision. A concrete or masonry wall shall be required along
the rear yards of lots platted on such cul-de-sacs or as required by the Planning
Commission.
iv. On lots with available access only onto an arterial, a circular drive or some other
type of vehicular maneuvering area shall be provided to enable vehicles to enter
traffic moving forward rather than backing.
d. When any lot borders an arterial, the subdivider may be required to execute and deliver to
the City an instrument, deemed sufficient by the City Attorney's Office, prohibiting the
right of ingress and egress from the arterial to the lot, and a legal document sufficient to
guarantee maintenance of landscaping. The subdivider shall also be required to install
such paving as necessary to construct the arterial or to bring the arterial up to standard
width and shall install curb, gutter and sidewalk, along the arterial.
5-8-106 Protection Strips
Protection strips shall not be permitted under any circumstances.
5-8-107 Dedication And Reservation
1. In order to satisfy increased recreation facility needs created by a new development, an impact
fee shall be paid for the acquisition and development of park land. The fee shall be on a per
dwelling unit basis and shall be based on the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element of the
General Plan and The Parks, Recreation and Trails Capital Improvement Program and Impact
Fee Analysis. The fee shall be listed in the Consolidated Fee Schedule and may change from
time to time due to changes in the Impact fee analysis. The fee shall be deposited in a
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 36/50
designated account with monies expended only for planned park and recreation facilities
identified in the Capital Improvement Program. The must be paid prior to recordation of a
subdivision plat.
2. The Planning Commission may, at its discretion, require the dedication of land for park and
recreational purposes in lieu of some or all of the fee. Land to be dedicated may include all of the
proposed park or recreation facility, or may include only part of a facility. Such partial dedication
may be supplemented by additional land on adjoining property not owned by the subdivider. The
subdivider shall be notified, prior to final plat approval, if dedication of land is to be required in
lieu of some or all of the fee.
3. All land to be dedicated for park or recreational purposes shall be found to be suitable by the
Planning Commission, the Zoning Administrator, City Council and the City Engineer as to
location, parcel size and topography for the park and recreation purposes for which it is indicated
in the General Plan or any planned community plan. Such purposes may include active
recreation facilities such as playgrounds, play fields, pedestrian or bicycle paths, areas of
particular natural beauty and wooded areas to be developed or left in their natural state.
4. When park or recreational facilities approved for dedication are completed and accepted, a deed
shall be conveyed to the City, after which the supervision and maintenance shall be the
responsibility of the City. When park or recreational facilities are reserved, the developer shall
establish conditions as to ownership, maintenance and use of such areas as deemed necessary
by the Planning Commission to assure preservation of the intended use.
5. The provisions of this section shall not normally apply to commercial or industrial subdivisions;
however, the Planning Commission may recommend as a condition of approval, that a
commercial or industrial subdivider dedicate to the City that portion of a stream bed or drainage
channel falling within an industrial subdivision when such portion forms part of an open space
network designated in the General Plan or a planned community plan.
6. In addition to subdivisions, the provisions of this Section requiring the payment of a fee, or
dedication in lieu of a fee, shall apply to all residential developments which require conditional
use approval. Such developments shall include, but not be limited to, condominiums, planned
unit developments, dwelling groups, and mobile home parks. However, open space normally
provided in these types of developments may apply toward the required fee or dedication of land
up to a maximum of 50 percent of the required fee. The percentage of credit shall be determined
by the Planning Commission prior to final approval of a development plan. The fee shall be paid
prior to issuance of a building permit for the first dwelling unit in the development.
7. If the subdivider or developer feels that the impact of the proposed subdivision or other
residential development is substantially different than that presumed by this Section, the
subdivider or developer may apply for a hearing before the Planning Commission to request a
modification of the fee, or in lieu of, the dedication requirement of this Section. The request for
the hearing shall be made prior to final approval by the Planning Commission of the subdivision
or conditional use approval of the residential development. The Planning Commission may
recommend the modification only if the subdivider or developer proves that what is required
under this Section bears no reasonable relationship to the need for parks and recreation facilities
created by the subdivision or development. If the Planning Commission recommends such a
modification, the request shall be submitted to the City Council for final determination.
5-8-108 Landscaping
1. Whenever, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the cuts and fills in a hillside subdivision
are of sufficient size or visibility to demand special treatment, the subdivider shall be required to
landscape such areas with suitable permanent plant materials and to provide for their
maintenance.

5-8-110 Neighborhood Box Units
If the Postal Service requires Neighborhood box units, mail boxes in new subdivisions shall be
consolidated in centralized locations no further than 500 feet from any dwelling which the box unit is
designed to serve. Boxes shall not be located on corners, but shall be located at mid-block on a property
line. The boxes shall serve only those on same side of the street so that no street crossings are
necessary to retrieve mail.
5-8-111 Watercourses
The subdivider shall dedicate a right-of-way for storm drainage conforming substantially with the lines of
the limits established for future development of the American Fork River Walkway, or any other natural
watercourse or channel, stream, creek, irrigation ditch, or flood plain that enters or traverses the
subdivision. The subdivider shall also dedicate rights-of-way for any pipe, conduit, channel, and
retention or detention area as approved by the City Engineer for flood control.
5-8-112 Water Rights To Be Conveyed To City
1. Developer/Subdivider Requirements:
a. It is the intent of Highland City to assure each future lot owner reasonable access to
adequate irrigation water to make that lot productive; and, to initiate a program to provide
funding and adequate water resources for a more efficient irrigation water distribution
system.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 38/50
b. All developers of subdivisions, or land owners requesting a building permit, within the
boundaries of Highland City shall convey to Highland City adequate irrigation water, and
provide an adequate distribution system as recommended by the Planning Commission
and approved by the City Council with appropriate easements along a suitable grade by
which to convey the water to each lot. Adequate water is defined as providing 3.0 acrefeet
per acre of water for the irrigation season (April 15 - October 1) each year, with at
least 50% of said water right to be a stored water right. A combination of water shares
may be used to meet this requirement. Underground water rights may be used at a value
to be recommended by the City Engineer and approved by the City Council provided that
such rights are an underground water well right used on the property for which the water
is to be conveyed and not based on a change application from outside of Highland, or a
change application from an irrigation water right. The following table defines acceptable
shares of irrigation company stock per developed acre and their relative yield:
i. All land owners requesting connection to the Highland City Culinary Water system
are required to provide water to the city at a ratio of one acre foot per acre of
stored water per acre of property, except those parcels of land which were
included in the original boundaries of the Highland Water Co. Stored water is
defined as an underground water right accepted pursuant to the provisions of the
Highland Development Code or a stored surface right as permitted by Highland
Development Code.
IRRIGATION COMPANY ACRE-FOOT YIELD PER ACRE
American Fork 2.0
Lehi Irrigation 2.0
Highland Conservation 1.0
Provo Res. Water Users Full Season 4.0 (Effective 3/7/2000)
Provo Res. Water Users Late Season 2.5
Winn Ditch 0.06
Other Surface and Underground Water Rights As approved by the City Council
c. Because of the restrictions on transfer of Highland Conservation District (District) water,
transfer of any such water to Highland City shall be made by an irrevocable assignment in
a form acceptable to the City Council and the District which provides that the City may at
any time transfer the water to other property it owns or controls in the District. Any and all
use of such water by the City shall be governed by the Agreement between the City and
the District and any assignment of District water to the City shall be conditioned on
compliance with all terms and conditions of the Agreement. Transfer or assignment of
District water shall not be effective unless approved in writing by the District.
d. For purposes of this section an acre is defined to be 43,560 square feet. Acreage shall be
computed to two decimal places (e.g. 0.52 ac.). If fractional shares cannot be provided
then the number of shares required shall be determined by rounding up to the nearest
whole share.
e. The City intends to establish a pressurized irrigation system. When such a system is
constructed to serve any land for which water rights have been transferred to the City as
a condition of annexation, subdivision approval or issuance of a building permit, the water
rights so transferred to the City shall be credited to that land.

https://highland.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=Chapter_5_Subdivisions 39/50
f. Highland City will enter into an agreement with the developer of the subdivision and the
owners of lots in the subdivision for the use of the water transferred to the city pursuant to
this Code. The agreement shall provide that the developer or lot owners may continue to
use the water to irrigate the land in the subdivision provided that the users of the water
pay all assessments made thereon and that such agreement may be terminated by the
City at any time if the City Council determines that the water should be used for another
purpose.
g. As a condition of subdivision approval, annexation, or issuance of a building permit the
developer/owner shall enter into a contract with Highland City that any shares of irrigation
stock or other water rights in excess of that required by this Code, held by the owner of
such property on June 20, 1991, shall remain in Highland City. Developer/owner shall
also agree to notify the City Zoning Administrator of any transfer of said water shares or
stock. If the owner fails or refuses to agree as provided in this subsection; has
subsequent to June 20, 1991 sold water shares or water rights outside of Highland
without first contacting with the City as provided in this subsection; the developer/owner
shall, upon the City's discovery of such failure or refusal, pay to the City for such shares
or water rights twice the market value per share. The intent of this subsection is to retain
in Highland all irrigation water rights currently in Highland.

h. The City Council may accept payment to the City of an amount equal to the market value
of the required water shares or other water rights in lieu of providing water rights as
required by this section under the following conditions: (a) it would be an unusual
hardship to require the developer to provide water shares or other water rights; or (b) it
would be in the best interest of the City to accept payment rather than requiring transfer of
water shares or other water rights. The market value of the water shares or other water
rights shall be determined by the City Council and shall include the estimated cost to the
City of locating and purchasing equivalent water shares or other water rights. The
determination of whether to accept payment in lieu of transfer of water shares or other
water rights shall be at the discretion of the City Council and the City Council may require
a developer to obtain water shares or other water rights at the developer's expense and
transfer those shares or rights to the City. It is the policy of Highland City not to accept
any fee in lieu of providing water rights if, after January 1, 1982, water has been sold or
transferred of the land being developed, [or as a result of violations as described in
subsection 5-8-112(1)(g),so as to leave inadequate water rights with the land necessary
to meet adequate water right standards as defined in this Section. All fees paid pursuant
to this paragraph shall be used for irrigation water purchase, costs incurred in
development of a distribution system, or culinary water needs in the future.
i. As a condition for subdivision approval, all canals and ditches within the proposed
subdivision used for the distribution of irrigation water shall be covered or piped.
Ditches contiguous to the proposed subdivision may be required to be piped.
Irrigation easements along a suitable grade are required, whether the system is
built or the fee described below is paid. No open ditches shall be allowed unless
accepted and required by the Planning Commission and approved by the irrigation
company and the City Council. Appropriate grates, gates, vents, valves, drains
and other control structures shall also be required. In compliance with Section 73-
1-15, UCA 1953, as amended, the developer shall be responsible for obtaining
written approval from all affected irrigation companies for any proposed work
before final subdivision approval is granted; provided, however, the developer
shall also meet the specifications for pipe or covering size and requirements
established and approved by the City Engineer in accordance with the provisions
of state law. The Planning Commission and City Council may allow payment of a
fee in lieu of providing a piped water distribution system. Such fee shall be based
on one hundred (100) percent of the estimated the cost of installation of pipe sized
for flood irrigation, unless otherwise approved by the City Council and shall be
paid to the City. The estimated cost shall be determined by the City Engineer and
shall include interest, if any, and engineering fees. Fees and water shares thus
collected shall be held and used for a water system and shall be credited to the
parcels of land from which they originated as a prior right. Fencing of property
from canals and major ditches may be recommended by the Planning
Commission and irrigation company and approved by the City Council, subject to
the concurrence of the irrigation company, as described in this Code. Canals and
ditches within a defined conservation area need not be fenced, piped or covered if
the City Council determines that these improvements would destroy the purpose
of the conservation area. The City Council may prohibit fencing of ditches and
canals.
i. Unless water rights for the area being subdivided have previously been conveyed to the
City, the City Council shall require, as a condition of approval of the subdivision, all
subdividers to convey to the City water rights capable of producing sufficient water to
irrigate the area within the subdivision during the period April 15 to October 1 of each
year.

j. If the subdivision is of land for which water rights have been previously transferred to the
City upon annexation, the conveyance of water rights shall not be required.
2. Building Permit Requirements:
a. As a condition for the issuance of residential or commercial building permits for lots which
are not in platted subdivisions, all canals and ditches used for the conveyance of irrigation
water on or across the property shall be covered or piped. Ditches contiguous to the
property may be required to be piped. No open ditches shall be allowed unless accepted
and recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the Irrigation Company
and City Council. Appropriate grates, gates, vents, valves, drains and other control
structures as deemed necessary by the City Engineer shall also be required. In
compliance with Section 73-1-15, UCA 1953, as amended, an applicant for a building
permit will be responsible for obtaining written approval from all irrigation companies
involved as to size and specification of pipe and need for control structures before
issuance of the building permit; provided, however, if an irrigation company unreasonably
refuses to give such approval, the City Council may nevertheless authorize issuance of
the building permit.
b. In lieu of the builder providing a distribution system to the property, the Planning
Commission may approve a fee equivalent to the estimated cost of a piped system and
require that it be paid to the City. The fee shall be based on one hundred (100) percent of
the estimated cost of installation of pipe sized for flood irrigation, unless otherwise
approved by the City Council. The estimated cost shall be determined by the City
Engineer and shall include interest, if any, and engineering fees. Fees thus collected shall
be held and used for a future water system and shall be credited to the parcels of land
from which they originated as a prior right. Irrigation easements along a suitable grade
are required whether the system is built or in lieu fee paid. In the cases of building lots
larger than one acre, the Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council
may approve reasonable modifications to the requirements of this subsection.
c. As a further condition for the issuance of building permits on lots not in an approved
subdivision, the builder or owner shall transfer to the City adequate water rights.

5-8-113 Solar Access And Orientation
1. The street orientation in a subdivision shall be encouraged to run predominantly east/west in
order to maximize the amount of solar energy available to each structure, as topography and
property lines allow.
2. It is recommended that structures be oriented so that the longest axis is aligned due east/west,
or 15E plus or minus from east/west and that a minimum of 80 percent of the structures within a
given subdivision should be so aligned to maximize the amount of solar energy available to each
structure.
3. It is recommended that solar access be established for each dwelling such that the southern
elevation and roof of the dwelling is not shaded by the neighboring structure or trees and other
landscaping in their natural state from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on December 21, Mountain Standard
Time.

4. It is recommended that each dwelling be located within a pyramidal envelope on the lot such that
it will not penetrate the planes of the envelope. This building envelope is determined by 45E
angle planes drawn from the horizontal at the mean grade along each boundary of the lot and
each adjacent public right-of-way centerline. These planes slope inward to the center of the lot.
To allow for greater flexibility in siting the dwelling on the lot, another set of planes of 60E angle
sloping from the lot boundaries to the center of the lot are designated for the south, east and
west sides of the lot.
5. Solar access may be secured for any dwelling by negotiating a solar easement with the
landowner(s) to the south. See Appendix II, "Model Easement," as passed by the Utah
Legislature in March, 1979.

2. Project Completion.
a. Security Required. In order to protect the City from incomplete or inadequate installation
of the public improvements and Landscaping, the City requires the developer post a bond
in the amount of 110% for the public improvements and landscaping of which 10% will be
held after the public improvements and landscaping have been accepted by the city to
guarantee those public improvements and landscaping improvements. Also, all
landscaping requirements associated with each commercial or public/institutional building
shall be installed and bonded for prior to the final building inspection associated with a
building permit and issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
b. Construction According to Approved Plans. All construction shall be completed according
to the approved plans on which the building permit(s) was issued. The approved plans
shall also include the site improvements shown on the approved site plan. Deviations
from the approved plans must be approved in advance by staff, provided that requested
deviations to the site plan do not increase or decrease the approved building square
footage by five percent (5%) and that the project as a whole does not exceed the total
approved square footage (zero sum). If changes are requested that exceed a five percent
(5%) increase or decrease, the plans must be submitted by the applicant to be reviewed
and recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council prior to
approval of a building permit.
c. Security for Completion. No certificate of occupancy will be issued unless the building and
the site improvements associated with that building are completed, or the developer has
provided adequate security to guarantee completion of the associated site improvements.
When the site improvements and the building cannot be completed simultaneously due to
weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the developer (excluding
financial inability to complete the project) the City may issue a certificate of occupancy or
use inauguration for the project, provided the following conditions are met:
i. The building, buildings, or portions thereof, to be occupied have been constructed
in accordance with the approved plans for those buildings and are in full
compliance with applicable building and fire codes, and are completed to the
extent that only exterior site improvement work remains unfinished; and,
ii. The Building Inspector determines that occupancy of the buildings, or portions
thereof, prior to completion of required site improvements, is safe and that access
for emergency vehicles is adequate with the site improvements unfinished; and,
iii. The developer posts adequate security for the benefit of the City to insure
completion of the site improvements in full compliance with the approved plans
before occupancy or inauguration of use.
d. Amount of Security. The amount of security to be posted by the developer shall be
determined by the City Engineer, and shall be equal to 110% of the amount reasonably
estimated by the developer and City Engineer as being necessary to complete remaining
site improvements as shown on the approved plans. In the event that the developer
disputes the cost estimate of the Engineer, the developer may prove a lower construction
cost by providing binding contracts between the developer and contractor or
subcontractor appropriate to perform the required work at a stated, fixed price. Bid
proposals are not satisfactory for this purpose. If the contracts submitted are acceptable
in form, the amount of security required shall be 110% of the total contract price of all
such contracts submitted, plus 110% of the estimated reasonable cost of performing any
work not covered by the contracts. Specifications in such contracts shall be sufficiently
clear to identify the work called for under the contract.

e. Terms of Security. The terms of any security arrangement offered to the City shall state a
date certain by which the developer agrees to have site improvement work completed in
accordance with the plans. After completion of those improvements which are bonded for
and acceptance by the city, the city shall reimburse the bond in the amount of 100% of
the contract price and retain the remaining 10% to guarantee those improvements per
Section 6-108 (below). In the event that the developer has not completed required site
improvement work by that date, the City may, at its option and on its schedule, or draw on
the funds escrowed, by its own act, and shall not be required to obtain consent of
developer to withdraw funds for completion of the work shown on approved plans. The
City’s actual costs in administering the completion of work in the event of a default by the
developer shall be reimbursed from the escrow funds.
f. Form of Security. Security arrangements offered in lieu of simultaneous completion of
buildings and site improvements shall be in one or more of the following forms:
i. A deposit of cash with a third party escrow account through a financial institution
federally or state insured acceptable to the City.
g. Payment of Interest. Any interest accruing on escrowed funds shall, inure to the benefit of
the developer upon release and not to the City, provided all improvements have been
installed as required otherwise interest will inure to the city.

complete all of the public improvements required in the subdivision. Prior to recordation, the
subdivider shall enter into a bond agreement with the City to insure completion of all public
improvements required to be installed in the subdivision. The bond agreement shall be in a form
