[Ord. 11-03 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 1.05.010.]


1.25.020 Definitions.

(A) As used herein, “constitutional taking” means actions involving the physical or regulatory taking of private real property by any official, employee, board, commission or council of the City that might require compensation to a private real property owner under:

(1) The Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;

(2) Article I, Section 22 of the Utah Constitution; or

(3) Any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of private real property by a governmental entity.

(B) Actions by the City involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property is not a constitutional taking if the physical taking or exaction:

(1) Bears an essential nexus;

(2) To a legitimate governmental interest; and

(3) Is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an individualized property basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development on the legitimate government interest. [Ord. 11-03 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 1.05.020.]


1.25.030 Guidelines.

The following guidelines should be considered by any official, employee, board, commission or council of the City when taking any action that might result in the physical or regulatory taking of private real property without just compensation.

(A) Identification. The acting body should review the following items to determine and identify whether a proposed governmental action raises constitutional taking issues:

(1) Does the action result in a permanent physical occupation of private property?

(2) Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or grant an easement to the City?

(3) Does the action deprive the property owner of all economically viable uses of the property?

(4) Does the action have a severe impact on the property owner’s economic interest?

(5) Does the action deny a fundamental attribute of ownership?

(B) Analysis. If the acting body determines that a governmental action involves constitutional taking issues, the proposed action should be reviewed further to determine appropriate action. In reviewing the proposed action, the following factors may be analyzed:

(1) The effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the private property;

(2) The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking;

(3) Any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the City’s lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking;

(4) The cost to the City for payment of compensation if a taking is determined;

(5) The governmental interest involved and its nexus to the potential taking; and

(6) The proportionality and relationship between the proposed governmental action and the proposed development. [Ord. 11-03 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 1.05.030.]


1.25.040 Appeals.

(A) Application. Any owner of private property whose interest in the property is subject to a physical or regulatory taking by the City, pursuant to a final and authoritative decision or action by any official, employee, board, commission or council of the City, may appeal the acting body’s decision or action by filing a written notice of appeal and statement of the grounds for the appeal with the City Recorder within 30 days from the date of the acting body’s decision or action. Additional information regarding the claim, such as property valuation and ownership, may be required in conjunction with the application as deemed necessary by the City for proper review of the action.

(B) Review. The City Council or its designee shall hear all evidence regarding the appeal and determine whether or not the action by the City constitutes a constitutional taking as defined herein. The reviewing body shall render its decision and findings in writing within 14 days from the date the appeal was filed. The decision of the reviewing body shall be given to the applicant and the official, employee, board, commission or council that rendered the final decision giving rise to the appeal. When determined to be necessary and appropriate, the reviewing body shall make a recommendation to the official, employee, board, commission or council that made the decision giving rise to the appeal.

(C) Failure to Render Decision. If the City fails to hear and decide the appeal within 14 days, the acting body’s decision or action is presumed to be approved. [Ord. 11-03 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 1.05.040.]

3.25.040 Syracuse historic site list.

The Historic Preservation Commission may designate historic properties to the historic sites list as a means of providing recognition to and encouraging the preservation of historic resources in the community, in accordance with the procedure set forth below.

(A) Criteria for Designating Properties to the City Historic Sites List. Any building, structure, object, or site may be designated to the historic sites list if it meets all the criteria outlined below:

(1) It is located within the official boundaries of the City;

(2) It is at least 50 years old;

(3) It retains its historic integrity, in that there are no major alterations or additions that have obscured or destroyed the significant historic features of the resource. Major alterations that would destroy the historic integrity include, but are not limited to, changes in pitch of the main roof, enlargement or enclosure of windows on the principal facades, addition of upper stories or the removal of original upper stories, covering the exterior walls with nonhistoric materials, moving the resource from its original location to one that is dissimilar to the original, additions which significantly detract from or obscure the original form and appearance of the house when viewed from the public way;

(4) It has been documented according to the Utah State Historic Preservation Office standards for intensive level surveys (March 1987 version or subsequent revisions) and copies of that documentation have been placed in the local and state historic preservation files.

(B) Designation Procedures. Any person, group, or government agency may nominate a property for listing in the City historic sites list. The nomination and listing procedures are as follows:

(1) Completed intensive level survey documentation for each nominated property must be submitted in duplicate to the Historic Preservation Commission.

(2) The Commission will review and consider properly submitted nominations at its next scheduled meeting. The Commission will notify the nominating party, either orally or in writing, one week prior to the meeting that the nomination will be considered and will place that item on the agenda posted for the meeting. The one-week notification may be waived at the property owner’s option in order to accommodate “last-minute” submittals, though no nomination will be reviewed if it is submitted to the Commission less than 48 hours prior to the meeting.

(3) The Historic Preservation Commission will review the documentation for completeness, accuracy and compliance with the “Criteria for Designating Historic Properties to the Syracuse Historic Sites List.”

(C) Results of Designation to the Historic Sites List.

(1) Owners of officially designated historic sites may obtain a historic site certificate from the Historic Preservation Commission. The certificate contains the historic name of the property, the date of designation, and signatures of the Mayor and the Chairperson of the Historic Preservation Commission.

(2) Proposed exterior work on historic site register structures requiring a building permit, sign permit or demolition permit is subject to the Commission’s prior review in order to ensure the preservation of such structures to the greatest degree possible.

(3) If a historic site is to be demolished or extensively altered, efforts will be made to document its physical appearance before that action takes place.

(a) The City will delay issuing a demolition permit for a maximum of one week and will notify a member of the Historic Preservation Commission, which will take responsibility for the documentation.

(b) Documentation will include, at minimum, exterior photographs (both black-and-white and color slides) of all elevations of the historic building. When possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the building will be made in order to provide an accurate floor-plan drawing of the building.

(c) The demolition permit will be issued after one week of the initial application whether or not the Commission has documented the building. The permit may be issued earlier if the Commission completes its documentation before the one-week deadline.

(d) The documentation will be kept in the Commission’s historic site files, which are open to the public.

(D) Removal of Properties from the Historic Sites List. Properties which, in the opinion of the Historic Preservation Commission, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility may be removed from the historic sites list after review and consideration by the Commission. [Ord. 11-07 § 1 (Exh. A); amended 1997; Code 1971 § 3.05.040.]


3.25.050 Syracuse historic landmark register.

Significant historic properties may be designated to the historic landmark register in accordance with the procedure set forth below for the purposes of recognizing their significance and providing incentives and guidelines for their preservation.

(1) It is located within the official boundaries of the City;

(2) It is at least 50 years old;

(3) It is currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or it has been officially determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under the provisions of 36 CFR  60.6(s). Properties listed on or determined eligible for the National Register must, in addition to retaining their integrity, meet at least one of the following National Register criteria:

(a) Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or

(b) Associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

(c) Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or

(d) Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history (archaeological sites, for example); and

(4) The owner of the property approves of the action to designate his/her property to the historic landmark register and has submitted to the Commission a written statement to that effect.

(B) Designation Procedures.

(1) Official designation proceedings must begin with the submittal of a written request for designation by the property owner to the Commission Chairperson. The letter must identify the property by its address and historic name, give the date the property was listed in the National Register or officially determined eligible, and include a statement verifying that the property owner is indeed the owner of legal record of the property proposed for designation. This official request may be preceded by informal contacts with the property owner by Commission members, private citizens, local officials, or others regarding designation of the property.

(2) Upon receipt of the written request for designation, the Commission Chairperson shall arrange for the nomination to be considered at the next Commission meeting, which shall be held at a time not to exceed 30 days from the date the request was received.

(3) The decision by the Commission shall be based on the eligibility of the property in terms of meeting the “Criteria for Designating Properties to the Syracuse Historic Landmark Register.” The Commission shall forward its recommendation in writing to the City Council within 14 days.

(4) The City Council may, by approval and passage of an appropriate resolution, designate properties to the historic landmark register. Following designation, a notice of such shall be mailed to the owners of record, together with a copy of this chapter.

(5) After a property has been formally designated to the historic landmark register, the designation may be amended or rescinded in the same manner as the original designation was made.

(6) Upon official designation, the Commission shall record the designation with the county recorder’s office to indicate such designation on the official title thereof.

(C) Results of Designation to the Historic Landmark Register.

(1) Properties designated to the historic landmark register may receive special consideration in the granting of zoning variances or conditional use permits in order to encourage their preservation.

(2) In the event of rehabilitation of the property, local building officials may consider waiving certain code requirements in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC), which governs historic buildings.

(3) Owners of historic landmarks may seek assistance from the Historic Preservation Commission in applying for grants or tax credits for rehabilitating their properties.

(4) Proposed repairs, alterations, or additions to any structure on the historic landmark register are subject to review of the Historic Preservation Commission and the subsequent review and approval of the City Council. The purpose of this review is to ensure the preservation of historic materials and features to the greatest degree possible.

(a) Applications for permits pertaining to historic landmark properties shall be forwarded by the Building Inspector to the Historic Preservation Commission prior to their issuance.

(b) At its next scheduled meeting, the Commission shall review the application and proposed work for compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation,” hereafter referred to as the “Standards.”

(c) The Commission’s recommendation shall be forwarded within three days to the City Council for its consideration in reviewing the applications. The recommendation must indicate which of the “Standards” the Commission’s decision was based on and, where appropriate, a brief explanation. Copies of the recommendations shall be sent to the Building Inspector and the property owner at the same time.

(d) The City Council shall schedule the matter for its next meeting and, upon review of the Historic Preservation Commission’s recommendation and other comments given at the meeting, make a decision regarding the appropriateness of the proposed action. Approved projects will be issued a certificate of historical appropriateness which authorizes the building permit to be issued.

(5) Claims of Economic Hardship. The Commission may approve issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for rehabilitation or demolition of a landmark property if the owner has presented compelling, substantial evidence demonstrating that unreasonable economic hardship will result from denial of the certificate of appropriateness.

(a) Economic Hardship Criteria. In order to sustain a claim of unreasonable economic hardship, the Commission may require the owner to provide evidence from a qualified third party regarding whether the property is capable of producing a reasonable economic return for the owner.

(b) Demonstration of Economic Hardship. Demonstration of economic hardship by the owner shall not be based on conditions resulting from willful or negligent acts by the owner, purchasing the property for substantially more than market value at the time of purchase, failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs, failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant improvements.

(6) Appeal. An applicant who has been denied any permit by the City’s Community Development Department or Planning Commission, based on the Commission’s refusal to issue a certificate of historic appropriateness, may appeal that decision to the City Council at any time within 30 days after the decision.

(D) Removal of Properties from Historic Landmark Register. Properties which, in the opinion of the Commission, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility, may be removed from the City’s historic landmark register after review and consideration by the commission and affirmative vote of the City Council.

(E) Amendment to Historic Landmark Register. The City Council may amend the City’s historic landmark register from time to time, including deleting sites or adding additional sites.

(F) Enforcement. The provisions of this section are subject to the enforcement provisions established in the Syracuse City Code pertaining to noncompliance with the International Building Code as adopted by the State of Utah, and to other applicable provisions of City ordinances relating to ordinance violations. [Ord. 11-07 § 1 (Exh. A); amended 1990; Code 1971 § 3.05.050.]


3.25.060 Standards for rehabilitation.

The following standards for rehabilitation shall be used by the Historic Preservation Commission and City Council when determining the historic appropriateness of any application pertaining to historic landmark properties:

(A) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible purpose for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment.

(B) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.

(C) All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historic basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.

(D) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.

(E) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity.

(F) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.

(G) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.

(H) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any rehabilitation project.

(I) Contemporary design for alteration and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historic, architectural or cultural materials, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood or environment.

(J) Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. [Ord. 11-07 § 1 (Exh. A); amended 1990; Code 1971 § 3.05.060.]

The City shall issue, after determining that the proposed excavation is necessary and that the same will not unreasonably damage said public right-of-way, a permit to undertake and complete such excavation.

(C) Prior to the issuance of a permit covering such excavation, the City shall require a bond issued by a licensed surety company of the state of Utah or a cashier’s check made out in favor of Syracuse City in an amount sufficient to guarantee restoration of public infrastructure to its original condition. All persons or firms making such excavations must hold a valid license from the state of Utah and must maintain adequate public liability insurance.

(D) No such excavation nor obstruction to any public right-of-way shall be made without notifying the City of Syracuse in advance of the time when it is proposed to begin such excavation. It shall be unlawful for any person to close any public right-of-way or to prevent the flow of traffic thereon without first obtaining permission therefor from the City of Syracuse.

(E) All backfill shall meet standard specifications and all materials used shall be properly tamped or settled with a sufficient quantity of water to assure proper compaction. The contractor shall be required to test the compaction and submit such compaction report to the City.

(F) It shall be unlawful for any person having made an excavation in any street, whether under a permit or otherwise, to fail, neglect, or refuse for a period of five days after notice, to restore said street to its normal condition. It shall be unlawful for any person, by or for whom any excavation is made in a public street or any purpose, to fail to properly protect the work zone area so as to enclose such excavation, together with the dirt, gravel, or other material thrown therefrom, and to maintain such protection during the entire duration such excavation continues. Visible flasher lights shall be fixed to parts of such barricade, or in some other proper manner over or near the excavation, and over and near the dirt, gravel, or other material taken therefrom, and so kept from the beginning of twilight through the whole of every night during all the time such excavation exists. It shall be unlawful for any person, maliciously or wantonly, and without legal cause, to extinguish, remove, or diminish said lights or tear down or remove any rail, fence, or barricade fixed in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(G) General Requirements. Each permittee or excavator for permittee shall comply with the following requirements:

(1) Haul away and properly dispose of all materials removed from each single excavated area less than 50 feet in length and 20 feet in width. The trench or excavation shall be refilled with new crushed road base and compacted to 96 percent and made ready for the asphalt finish surface. The trench or excavation shall be patched by the contractor in a thickness to match existing conditions or a minimum of four inches of asphalt.

(2) Make proper provisions for protecting the public with necessary guards, barricades, lights, signals and with all other appurtenances necessary to safeguard the lives and property of the users of such roadway, sidewalk, and other facilities, before any excavation begins under this permit and at all times during the excavation. Visible flasher lights shall be used in hours of darkness.

(3) Be responsible for all liability or personal injury resulting from neglect; indemnify Syracuse City against all claims, demands, costs, damages, attorney’s fees or other expenses of any kind occasioned by such neglect; and upon request of the City, produce evidence of insurance adequate to cover such claims.

(4) Be responsible for restoring all public rights-of-way and private improvements, including sidewalks, surfaces, curbs and gutters, driveways, ditches, sprinkler irrigation, and other landscaping, to their original condition, whether public or private, in a manner conforming to current Syracuse City specifications.

(5) Keep excavations to a minimum regardless of the age or condition of the pavement, and, wherever possible, locate excavations so that one “common” patch can cover as many excavations as possible.

(6) Restore roads to a passable and safe condition within 16 hours of commencing excavation. All remaining repairs and restoration shall take place within 10 calendar days from the date of the first excavation. All debris generated as a result of said excavation shall be removed immediately from the area upon completion of the excavation. If, within the standard 10 days, or other time period authorized by the City Engineer, the road cut or excavation has not been repaired as required, Syracuse City may place claim on the excavation bond to cover expenses necessary to complete the necessary repairs. The costs of repair shall include administrative costs. The permittee or excavator for the permittee shall be responsible for trench maintenance for one year after the date it was inspected and approved by the Public Works Department. If repair of the road cut or trench is necessary within the initial one-year period, the permittee shall make repairs to the satisfaction of the City Engineer or, in the alternative, the City may place claim on the excavation bond and cause the repairs to be made.

(7) Limit the trench length left at grade but unpaved to a maximum of 1,000 feet. No excavation shall be allowed to continue until the 1,000 feet of trench has been restored with proper asphalt surface and inspected and accepted by the City.

(8) Place flowable fill in all excavations of 12 inches or less in width, prior to the application of an asphalt finished surface.

(9) Compact all backfilled excavations to 96 percent. The contractor shall submit tests to the City confirming the compaction.

Contractors shall complete small bores under two-lane roadways in one continuous operation.

(11) Utilize common trenching in all subdivisions, unless otherwise approved or excepted by the City Engineer.

(12) Bore all utility excavations whenever possible.

The City Engineer may, in the Engineer’s reasonable discretion, and subject to the provisions of any approved franchise ordinance or agreement of the City, defer construction or other activity under any permit provided for in this chapter, until such time as the Engineer deems it proper in all cases where the public place on which the work is desired to be done is occupied or about to be occupied in any work by the City, or by some other person having a right to use the same in such manner as to render it seriously inconvenient to the public to permit any further obstruction thereof at such time, and in granting such permit, may so regulate the manner of doing such work in order to cause the least inconvenience to the public in the use of such public place; and in all cases any work of the City or its contractors or employees for municipal purposes shall have precedence over all work of every other kind.

[Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-01-090.]


4.05.100 Permanent restoration.

Excavator shall complete permanent repairs of the temporary restoration within one year after completion of the work for which the permit was issued. If the excavator fails to complete the permanent restoration within this time period and in a manner approved by the City Engineer, the City may perform the restoration and bill the permittee for the repair. All permanent repairs shall be bonded for at the time of the issuance of a permit. Upon failure to complete applicable permanent restoration and receiving notice from the City, the City shall place claim to said bond for reimbursement of incurred expenses to complete the restoration. The permittee may, at the time the permit is issued, contract with the City for the completion of the permanent restoration. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-01-100.]

All agencies, utilities, franchises, and other entities planning work in a public right-of-way or other public place that will require a permit under this chapter shall submit a list of proposed projects and locations to the City Engineer by December 31st of each year. This list shall cover the planned projects for the following three years. These lists of planned projects shall be entered into the City’s geographic information system and integrated with other information on street condition and use. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “planned projects” does not include new construction that could not have reasonably been foreseen at the beginning of the year. The City Engineer may deny entities or agencies that fail to provide this information permits for construction or other activity under this chapter unless the entity was not provided a list of planned street improvements by the City for that year. The City may hold an annual meeting for the purpose of providing and explaining such list. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-01-110.]


4.05.120 Restoration of asphalt cuts.

For any asphalt surface three years old or less, excavator shall provide new asphalt for the length of the cut and the width of all lanes affected by the construction or other activity. For any asphalt surface where 30 percent or more of the width of any lane is affected by the construction or other activity, excavator shall provide new asphalt for the length of the cut and the width of all lanes affected. For all other asphalt surfaces, excavator shall provide new asphalt for the length and width of the affected area as required in this chapter. The City Engineer may require that the surface of the street receiving new asphalt be rotomilled prior to resurfacing. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-01-120.]


4.05.130 Excavation through intersection requires dry lines.

Every person seeking a permit to excavate in or through an intersection shall be required to place conduit in the open trench for the purpose of allowing placement of future utilities without disruption to the surface of the right-of-way. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-01-130.]


4.05.140 Laterals.

The City shall notify all abutting property owners along the affected portion of a street proposed for opening by the City, and a permittee shall notify all property owners, as determined by the last tax assessment rolls, of the intent to open the street and shall provide to each owner an opportunity to place, at the owner’s expense, laterals for the utilities to their property prior to closing the trench. No excavation for laterals shall be allowed for a period of three years after construction or reconstruction of a street, where such notice was given and the property owner declined to install the lateral.

The City Engineer may waive this barrier to entering a street if the required notice was not sent or if the Engineer determines that the excavation is necessary to provide an essential service that cannot be provided, except by cutting the street. The permittee shall pay a fee equal to the estimated damage to the useful life of the street and any associated repairs and shall repave that portion of the street necessary to restore it, as close as possible, to its original condition, as determined by the City Engineer. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-01-140.]


4.05.150 Restoration of public property.

Applications shall be in the form prescribed by the district board. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-02-090.]


4.10.100 Wastewater discharge prohibitions and limitations.

(A) Generally. No person shall discharge into the sewer system any substance or in a manner which, under ordinary circumstances, either (1) is harmful or detrimental to or interferes with either the sewer system, the functioning of the sewer system, the environment, or the public health, or (2) causes sewage to pass through the sewer system without treatment and thereby creating a significant health hazard or diminishing the quality of the environment.

(B) Discharge Prohibitions. No person shall discharge into the sewer system any substance or discharge into the system in a manner which violates the wastewater discharge prohibitions and limitations contained within the district wastewater control rules and regulations currently in force and as amended from time to time, which are incorporated by this reference as a part hereof as though fully set forth herein, together with any schedules or appendices which are a part of the district wastewater control rules and regulations.

(C) Immediate Reporting. Immediately upon discharging a prohibited substance or upon discovering that a prohibited substance has been discharged, the person performing or discovering such discharge shall immediately notify the staff of the district of the discharge by the most rapid available means, if such person knows or reasonably should have known that (1) the substance was discharged, and (2) the discharge of the substance was prohibited. Notification pursuant to this subsection does not relieve the person notifying of any liability, except liability for violation of this subsection.

(D) Preventing Accidental Discharge.

(1) Generally. Every person conducting an activity which creates a substantial risk that a prohibited substance will be discharged into the sewer system shall provide adequate protection against accidental discharge of such a prohibited substance by either (a) implementing procedures or practices which tend to reduce the likelihood of such a discharge, and/or (b) installing facilities designed to prevent such accidental discharge. The district general manager may identify persons required to provide such protection and direct them to comply with this subsection.

(2) City/District Requirements. The City Public Works Director and/or the district general manager are hereby authorized to specify particular procedures, practices, and/or facilities which shall be implemented by any person, (a) if the district general manager finds that there is substantial risk of a discharge prohibited by this section if preventive measures are not undertaken, and (b) if such procedures, practices and/or facilities substantially reduce the risk of discharge prohibited by this section, and (c) if the cost of implementing such procedures, practices, and/or installing such facilities is found by the City Council and/or district board to be reasonable in light of both the potential damage to the sewer system and/or the environment if an accidental discharge occurs, and the effectiveness of the equipment in preventing such an accidental discharge.

(3) Plans. In every case where facilities are required to be installed pursuant to this subsection, the Public Works Director and/or district general manager are hereby authorized to require submission of detailed plans for the required facilities and their operation before construction of the facilities is begun.

(E) Preventive Requirements.

(1) Report. Within five days after the discharge of a prohibited substance, the person who discharged such substance shall file with the City a written report describing (a) the nature and content of the discharge, (b) the cause(s) of the discharge, and (c) remedial measures to be taken by the discharger to prevent similar discharges in the future. The City Public Works Director or his designee may inspect the site of the accidental discharge and interview any person involved in the discharge in order to ascertain or confirm what happened and assure that remedial measures adequate to prevent future accidents are carried out as represented.

(2) Authorization to Require Changes. If (a) a person has discharged a prohibited substance, and (b) it is likely that the same person will again discharge a similar prohibited substance in the future if preventive measures are not undertaken, then the Public Works Director is hereby authorized to require the person who discharged the prohibited substance to make change(s) in equipment, facilities, procedures, or practices, which change(s): (a) have the effect of substantially reducing the risk of a similar discharge in the future, and (b) are found by the Public Works Director to be reasonable in cost in light of the potential damage to the system and environment arising out of a similar prohibited discharge in the future. Nothing in this subsection relieves any person of any liability, except liability for violation of this subsection.

(F) Self-Monitoring and Reporting. The Public Works Director is hereby authorized to require that persons discharging into the sewer system, other than persons discharging only ordinary domestic sewage, monitor and report their sewage discharges in a manner and to the extent necessary to: (1) provide adequate compliance with and enforcement of the district’s wastewater control rules and regulations; (2) assess the source of the components of the sewage transmitted by the City and treated and disposed of by the district; and (3) charge reasonable fees and surcharges to dischargers based on actual discharges or reasonable classifications of discharges. The Public Works Director is further hereby authorized to require that such monitoring and reporting be performed at the expense of the person discharging. Every person required to monitor and report pursuant to this section shall monitor and report as required by the district wastewater control rules and regulations and in conformity with this section.

(G) Compliance Monitoring. The district pretreatment administrator is hereby authorized to sample and analyze the sewage of, and inspect the facilities of, persons discharging into the sewer system in order to determine or verify compliance with this section. The City Council is further authorized to require the installation of reasonable facilities, such as manholes, to enable such sampling. However, nothing in this section limits any power that the City or District may have to investigate or enforce compliance with other sections of this chapter or through means not specified in this subsection.

(H) Strict Liability. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be guilty without regard to fault, knowledge, intent, or the state of mind of the person committing the violation.

(I) Nuisance. Any condition or situation which causes a violation of this section is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and may be abated as provided by law. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-02-100.]


4.10.110 Authorization necessary to reconnect.

It shall be unlawful for any person, after sewer service to any premises has been discontinued or disconnected for any reason whatsoever, to reconnect or resume such service or for the owner or occupant of such premises to allow the same to be reconnected or resumed without being authorized by the City. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-02-110.]


4.10.120 Authorized representative to have free access.

Free access shall, at all ordinary hours, be allowed to authorized representatives of the City and/or the district or other owner of such sanitary sewer to inspect and examine such facilities, including service laterals connected to the building, to inspect the plumbing and facilities therein and the manner of use of such sewer facilities, and to determine compliance with the rules and regulations of the City and/or the district or other owner of such sanitary sewer facilities. [Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 4-02-120.]


4.10.130 Nongravity sewer discharge.

Any lift stations, sump pumps or other facilities designed to cause sewer to move to higher elevations shall not be dedicated to or accepted by the City. The City shall have no responsibility to own, operate, maintain or replace such facilities. Any such facilities shall be owned, operated, maintained, and annually inspected through a public special service district. For single lot subdivisions or individual site plans, any such facilities shall be owned, operated, and maintained privately. [Ord. 16-07 § 1 (Exh. A).]1

The application shall set forth the distance and location of the proposed extension, a map of the extension, the size, location and number of connections that applicant will require, and the intended use; i.e., residential, multifamily, commercial and/or industrial.

(B) Review. The application shall be submitted to the City by the developer with the preliminary plat or site plan review for the development and shall be reviewed by the City Engineer. Upon a finding by the City that the City has available water rights, water source capacity, and water distribution and storage facility capacity to serve the proposed development with a year-round supply of water, the application may be accepted.

(C) Agreement. Upon acceptance of the application for extension and water service, the developer shall enter into a written extension agreement with the City specifying the terms and conditions under which the water extensions and connections shall be made to the City water system and the payments that shall be required.

(D) Expense. The developer shall be required, at his or her own expense, to make, construct, and lay such extension from the existing main to the proposed subdivision, development or building. Developer shall construct, at its sole expense, the internal or on-site water distribution system required to serve the individual consumers within developer’s subdivision or development, including all booster pumps, on-site storage, and other appurtenant facilities, as well as any off-site reservoir required for the development. All improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the City’s specifications. Service and connection to the City water system shall not be permitted until such improvements are inspected, approved and accepted by the City.

4.40.090 Erosion control on construction sites.

(A) City Storm Water Activity Permit.

(1) Any person or business responsible for disturbing one acre or more of ground in part (as a common plan of development) or in whole, shall obtain a City storm water activity permit from the Syracuse City Public Works Department. Syracuse City will comply with the requirements for the Clean Water Act Phase II, and all other state and federal regulations. This is to include applications, permits, plans and implementation. No person shall be granted a storm water activity permit for land disturbance that would require the uncovering of one acre or more without the approval of a storm water pollution prevention plan by the Syracuse City Public Works Department.

(a) Syracuse City Storm Water Activity Permit. This permit can be obtained from the City Public Works Department with building permits or with the subdivision approval prior to the preconstruction meeting for the proposed development. All projects and sites with a total plan to affect one acre or greater of land disturbance or is a part of a common plan of development must apply. Additionally, before connecting to an existing storm drain system (ditches, pipes, catch basin, boxes, manholes, etc.) the developer/contractor shall obtain a storm water activity permit from the City Public Works Department. All basins shall be calculated, designed and stamped by a licensed professional engineer. Any appropriate fees must be paid.

(b) Utah Pollution Discharge Elimination System (UPDES) Permit. This permit is filed with the Utah Division of Water Quality, Department of Environmental Quality. The permit can be obtained from the Internet at: http://waterquality.utah.gov/updes/stormwater.htm. All sites with a total plan to affect one acre or greater than one acre of land disturbance must apply. Sites that are smaller than one acre, but are a part of an overall development that is larger than one acre shall obtain the UPDES Common Plan Permit. The appropriate fee must be paid to the state. A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) or erosion control plan or pollution prevention plan must be prepared and on site for this application. A minimum requirement for approval is possession of an active BMP plan for the proposed project.

(c) Stream Alteration Permit. A stream alteration permit is filed with the state Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water Rights. This permit overlaps the 404 wetlands permit because it is applicable to the area equal to the stream plus two times the bankfull width up to 30 feet. Any modifications to the stream or banks within this area must comply with the stream alteration permit.

(d) EPA 404 Wetlands Permit. This permit is filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is applicable for all wetlands within a development. This will apply to all wetlands depending upon the presence of water, soils type, and vegetation as determined in a wetlands delineation report. All “waters of the U.S.” are affected to the normal high water mark. No fee is typically required for this permit. A letter of nonregulated wetlands may be applicable. Any mitigation that may be required must be done prior to recording a final plat.

(e) Fugitive Dust Control Plan. All construction sites that disturb land that is one-quarter acre or larger shall obtain a permit from the Utah Division of Air Quality.

(2) Each City storm water activity permit application shall bear the name and address of the owner or developer of the site, and of any consulting firm retained by the applicant together with the name of the applicant’s principal contact at such firm and shall be accompanied by a filing fee established by resolution of the City Council.

(3) The applicant must also obtain a general state construction storm water permit from the Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality.

(4) A City storm water activity permit is not required for the following activities:

(a) Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the protection of life, property, or natural resources.

(b) Existing nursery and agricultural operations conducted as a permitted main or accessory use.

(B) Application Review Fees. The fee for review of the construction storm water permit shall be based on the amount of land to be disturbed at the site. The deposit for storm water activity permits shall be required on all projects disturbing one acre or greater. The fee structure shall be established from time to time by resolution of the Syracuse City Council. All of the monetary fees shall be credited to a local budgetary category to support local plan review, inspection and program administration, and shall be made prior to the issuance of any building permit or construction activity for the development.

(C) Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).

(1) A storm water pollution prevention plan shall be required with all permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing storm water generated at the project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of storm water management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of storm water runoff from future development. The storm water pollution prevention plan shall be prepared in accordance with a checklist provided by the Public Works Department.

(2) For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed site, an applicant shall be required to include within the storm water pollution prevention plan measures for controlling existing storm water runoff discharges from the site in accordance with the standards of this chapter to the maximum extent practicable.

(D) Review and Approval.

(1) The Public Works Department will review each application to determine its conformance with the provisions of this regulation. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the Public Works Department shall, in writing:

(a) Approve the permit application;

(b) Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this regulation, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or

(c) Disapprove the permit application, indicating the reason(s) and procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission.

(2) Failure of the Public Works Department to act on an original or revised application within the specified time period shall authorize the applicant to proceed with the plans as filed unless such time is extended by agreement between the applicant and the Public Works Department.

(E) Inspection. Construction shall not begin until an initial inspection of the BMP installations on the site have been installed and approved by the City. Routine field inspections for construction shall be conducted monthly at a minimum by the Syracuse City Public Works Department, the City Ordinance Enforcement Officer or other designated agent as outlined in the inspection form provided by the Public Works Department. A final inspection shall be performed when the site is at least 70 percent stabilized. Any outstanding items indicated on the final inspection form shall be complete prior to issuance of a notice of termination (NOT). Any deposit collected may be refunded after the NOT is complete and the site is cleaned with BMPs removed and drainages cleared. All or part of the deposit may be retained by the City for work performed by the City to remove BMPs and clean the site.

(F) Access to Property. Syracuse City employees and authorized agents have the authority to enter private property, excluding private dwellings, to inspect sites, provide maintenance, repair and replace infrastructure, operate facilities, mark utilities, verify illicit connections and illicit discharges to ensure systems are protected, clean, and functioning properly. Advanced notice should be provided by City officials as reasonable under the circumstances prior to attempted entry. If entry to property for which there exists a reasonable expectation of privacy is denied by the owner or a person who manages the site, then officials may apply for a warrant to enter the property, unless exigent circumstances make a warrantless entry reasonable.

(G) As Built Plans. All applicants are required to submit actual “as built” plans for any storm water management practices located on site after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all storm water management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the Syracuse Off-Site Improvement Inspector and the Public Works Department is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. [Ord. 18-18 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-02 § 18; Ord. 06-06 § 1; Code 1971 § 4-08-090.]


4.40.100 Post construction.

Unless judged by the Syracuse City Public Works Department to be exempt, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites:

(A) All site designs shall establish storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates. Transmission pipes shall be designed to accommodate a 10-year, one-hour storm, and regional detention basins shall be designed to facilitate a 100-year, one-hour storm, with a 0.2 cfs per acre discharge. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.

(B) All storm water runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated storm water directly into a jurisdictional wetland or waters of the state without adequate treatment. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any greater than that allowed by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) or the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) responsible for natural resources.

(C) Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods. At a minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the annual recharge from predevelopment site conditions.

(D) Storm water discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain storm water management practices.

(E) Storm water discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as “hotspots,” may require the use of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices. Oil separators shall be required on all sites greater than one acre identified as “hotspots,” such as commercial land use sites, parking areas other than residential, mechanic shops, fuel stations, or associated parking areas. Oil separators must be capable of removing particulates down to 150 microns. Design and sizing requirements of oil separators shall be stamped by a professional engineer and reviewed by the City Engineer prior to installation. [Ord. 18-18 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-06 § 1; Code 1971 § 4-08-100.]


4.40.110 Basic storm water management design criteria.

(A) Site Design Feasibility. Storm water management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be considered:

(1) Topography.

(2) Maximum drainage area.

(3) Depth to water table.

(4) Soils.

(5) Slopes.

(6) Ground cover.

(7) Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or ultra-urban areas.

(B) Conveyance Issues. All storm water management practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:

(1) Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points.

(2) Protection of inlet and outfall structures.

(3) Elimination of erosive flow velocities.

(4) Providing of under drain systems, where applicable.

(C) Low impact development (LID) techniques shall be considered in developments. This includes consideration for storm water retention on site at the eightieth percentile storm event. Each development shall submit a storm water quality report completed and stamped by a licensed engineer to determine if conditions on the site can accommodate retention and what level of retention is necessary. Any storm water that is not retained shall be detained prior to discharging storm water from the site into storm conveyances or, with approval of the City Engineer, shall be conveyed by pipe the entire length from the development to the floodplain elevation. Any new storm drain outfalls to the floodplain must be approved by the City Engineer. Detention basins and piping shall be designed as follows:

(1) Storm water conveyance pipe at 10-year design standard.

(2) Detention basin capacity at 100-year design standard.

Local storm drain pipes and inlet structures shall be designed to convey the storm waters of a 10-year event totally within an underground pipe system. The storm water piping shall handle the 10-year event. All storm water calculations for detention shall be detailed to show that the entire area in consideration shall meet the requirement of 0.2 cfs discharge per acre developed. Some areas may be more restrictive based upon outfall capacities. Any storm water in excess of this requirement shall be detained.

(D) Farmer-Fletcher rainfall distribution is used to determine the storm calculations for Syracuse City.

(E) Detention Basin Construction and Design Criteria.

(1) The location of the basin shall be such that convenient access for maintenance is possible. This generally means that local access is available to a dedicated roadway; any easements are provided by the owner of the property in question. In addition, volume in adjacent swales or ditches shall not be considered a portion of the storage system.

(2) The side slopes to all basins shall not exceed 3:1 (three horizontal feet to one foot vertical elevation rise) slope, with 4.5:1 being desirable, for the ease of maintenance and mowing.

(3) The bottom slope shall be designed to prevent permanent stagnation of water, and shall be minimum of two percent from inlet to outlet. The City may request additional low flow elimination remedies during the subdivision warranty period if stagnation of nuisance water occurs.

(4) The basin freeboard shall be a minimum of one foot (top of berm or surface to high water mark of overflow outlet).

(5) The spillway shall be designed to overflow onto a City street or other channel with the capacity to contain and carry the overflow to an approved outlet. Said path to either a street or channel shall be within a maintained area, improved to allow flows without erosion, and within a drainage easement. All spillways shall be designed to protect adjacent embankments, structures or properties, and shall not present flooding potential to adjacent structures or homes.

(6) The outlet control for all small, localized basins may have fixed, size-calculated orifice plates, capable of being replaced if necessary, mounted on the outlet of the basin, as approved by the City Engineer. Large, regional basins shall be designed to have either fixed or screw-type gates installed to allow for adjustment by City personnel, if necessary. The screw-gates shall be Waterman C-10 O.A.E. or City Engineer approved equal.

(7) All grates shall be designed with hot-dipped galvanized (not painted) metal grates, with bars at spacing to prevent or prohibit children’s feet from falling in the structure, and still avoiding clogging with debris. Bar spacing shall never exceed three inches in any direction.

(8) Low flows shall be considered in low impact development techniques, but shall not create a health and safety risk to the public.

(9) The finish ground cover shall be either lawn sod or other landscaping, unless an alternate is approved by the City Council. A minimum four inches of top soil shall be installed prior to the area being sodded. If an alternate of weed barrier geo-textile fabric and cobbles is approved by the City Council, a minimum size of six-inch cobble rock is required.

(10) Basins shall be designed to allow vehicle access for maintenance by City personnel.

(F) Maintenance Agreements. All storm water treatment facilities that exist on privately owned property shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement shall be signed prior to construction.

(1) This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the storm water treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the storm water treatment facility. The agreement shall include provisions allowing for access and inspections on a reasonable basis. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all storm water treatment facilities shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance activities.

(2) If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance agreement, the Public Works Department, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the storm water management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the Public Works Department shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the storm water management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have 30 days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the Public Works Department may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the county assessor.

(G) Nongravity Discharge. Any lift stations, sump pumps or other facilities designed to cause storm water to move to higher elevations shall not be dedicated or accepted by the City. The City shall have no responsibility to own, operate, maintain or replace such facilities. Any such facilities shall be owned, operated, maintained, and annually inspected through a public special service district. For single lot subdivisions or individual site plans, any such facilities shall be owned, operated, and maintained privately. [Ord. 20-03 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 18-18 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 16-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-06 § 1; Code 1971 § 4-08-110.]


4.40.120 Notification of spills.

Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Syracuse City Public Works Department, within three business days of the notice. [Ord. 18-18 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-06 § 1; Code 1971 § 4-08-120.]


4.40.130 Enforcement, violation and penalties.

(A) Stop Work Order. In the event that any person holding a City storm water activity permit pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the permit or impedes site development in such a manner as to materially adversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or development site so as to be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the Public Works Department may suspend or revoke construction activities, such that no work on storm water infrastructure shall be performed or approved.

(B) Violation and Penalties. Whenever the Public Works Department finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the Syracuse City Public Works Department may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:

(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;

(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;

(4) The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;

(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and

(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.

Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a Class B misdemeanor and each day during which any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is committed, continued, or permitted shall constitute a separate offense. [Ord. 18-18 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 12-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-06 § 1; Code 1971 § 4-08-130.]

The provisions codified in this chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the “sexually oriented business and employee licensing ordinance.” [Ord. 11-08 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 6-5-010.]


5.25.020 Purpose and findings.

(A) Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

(B) Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984); and N.W. Enterprises v. City of Houston, 27 F.Supp. 2d 754 (S.D. Tex. 1998), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the City Council finds that:

(1) Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.

(2) Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located.

(3) Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.

(4) Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.

(5) Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.

(6) At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections.

(7) As of June 2001, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 793,025.

(8) The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 2000 was 702,093, a six percent increase over the year 1999.

(9) The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the 12-year period 1996-2000 was 212,672.

(10) The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,730,911 cases reported during the period 1996-2000.

(11) The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.

(12) According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.

(13) Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.

(14) Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view “adult” oriented films.

(15) Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity.

(16) Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use.

(17) Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare.

(18) The findings noted in subsections (B)(1) through (B)(17) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.

(19) Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.

(20) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.

(21) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments.

(22) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity.

(23) It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.

(24) The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter.

(25) The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

(26) The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this City will be promoted by enactment of this chapter.

(27) When more than one sexually oriented business use occupies the same location or business address, the secondary effects caused by such businesses are increased. Secondary effects are eliminated or controlled to a greater degree when only a single sexually oriented business use is allowed to occupy the same location. [Ord. 11-08 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 6-5-020.]

5.30.010 Purpose.

Residents of the City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The City has a substantial interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The City also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity. There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the City and its citizens and the effect of the regulations in this chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of the City officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door solicitation, the experience of its Law Enforcement Officers and those affected by door-to-door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door-to-door solicitation, the City adopts this chapter to promote the City’s substantial interests in:

(A) Respecting citizens’ decisions regarding privacy in their residence;

(B) Protecting persons from criminal conduct;

(C) Providing equal opportunity to advocates for and against religious beliefs, political position, or charitable activities; and

(D) Permitting truthful and nonmisleading door-to-door solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.

The City finds that the procedures, rules, and regulations set forth in this chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the City’s interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated. [Ord. 18-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 11-08 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 07-09 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 5-6-1.]

(B) Any business licensed by the City under another City ordinance that uses employees, independent contractors, or agents for door-to-door solicitation, in an effort to provide any tangible or intangible benefit to the business, shall be required to have such solicitors obtain a certificate, unless otherwise exempt from registration.

(C) Those responsible persons or entities associated with registered solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or registration from the City, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed place of business in the City.

(D) Nothing herein is intended to interfere with or supplant any other requirement of federal, state, or other local government law regarding any license, permit, or certificate that a registered solicitor is otherwise required to have or maintain. [Ord. 18-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 11-08 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 07-09 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 5-6-2.]

It shall further state that applicant or registered solicitor shall have 12 business days from receipt of the notice of denial or suspension to file an appeal. The denial or suspension of the certificate shall be effective no sooner than two calendar days from the date notice is sent, unless that suspension is because of exigent circumstances outlined in subsection (2)(d) of the definition of “Substantiated report” in SCC 5.30.030, in which case, the suspension is effective immediately. The denial or suspension shall remain effective unless and until the order is rescinded by the Licensing Officer upon finding of mistake or other good cause, overturned on appeal, or determined by a court to be contrary to equity or law. Failure to appeal the suspension of a certificate automatically results in its revocation. [Ord. 18-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 11-08 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 07-09 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 5-6-15.]

The City Council of Syracuse City finds that public nuisances exist in the City in the operation of certain commercial establishments and the use, alteration, maintenance or operation of residential, commercial, and industrial properties, in flagrant violation of the ordinances of the City or the laws of the state of Utah. All of these interfere with the interest of the public in property values, public health, safety, and welfare, and the quality of life and community environment. The Council further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities and violations is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the City and the businesses thereof. It is the purpose of the Council to create a standardized procedure for securing legal and equitable remedies in the civil courts relating to the subject matter encompassed by this law, without prejudice to the use of other remedies or procedures available under existing and subsequently enacted statutes or ordinances, and to strengthen existing laws on the subject.

The City Council may adopt written guidelines for the granting of extensions under this section. The grant of an extension shall not restrict the power of the Building Official to require vacation of premises, nor restrict the enforcement of other code violations. [Ord. 10-09 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 10-06 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 6-1-10.]

(1) If a change of the actual ownership of the subject property was recorded with the Davis County recorder’s office after the notice of violation was issued and the new owner is not related by blood, marriage, or common ownership to the prior owner;

(2) If the violation or inability to cure were caused by a force majeure event such as war, act of nature, strike, or civil disturbance;

(3) Compliance with the notice would have presented an imminent and irreparable injury to persons or property; or

(F) Correction after Expiration of Warning Period Not a Defense. It shall not be a defense that the responsible party corrected the violation after expiration of the warning period.

(2) Serve notice in writing upon the owner or occupant of such land, either personally or by following the notification procedures of this title, requiring such owner or occupant to abate the nuisances within the warning period as defined by this title.

(B) If a written request for hearing is not filed pursuant to SCC 6.15.050, the notice of the Inspector shall be final.

(C) If the owner or occupant fails to abate the nuisance, either in whole or in part, as required in a final notice, the City may summarily and without prior notice to the owner or occupant proceed to abate the nuisance. If such action is to be taken, the Inspector shall prepare an abatement order to be approved by the Community Development Director, or the Director’s designee, authorizing City personnel to perform such abatement work or to engage a private contractor to perform such work under the direction of the City. The order shall identify the property and describe the abatement work to be performed thereon.

If the owner or occupant eliminates the nuisance before the City performs the abatement work, the owner or occupant shall still be responsible for the costs incurred by the City in responding to the owner’s or occupant’s failure to abate the nuisance in a timely manner.

(E) If the owner or occupant refuses to allow entry, or other conditions exist on the property affecting the City’s ability to enter the property or otherwise complete the necessary abatement work, the City may seek, but is not required to seek, such judicial process as it deems necessary to effect the abatement.

(F) Personal property constituting a nuisance under this chapter may be confiscated as part of the abatement process. The City Council may adopt rules and regulations providing for the disposition of such property, including the disposition of inoperable, unlicensed, or abandoned vehicles. [Ord. 10-09 § 1 (Exh.

6.30.010 Policy considerations.

There is an underlying policy in Syracuse City strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the public’s right to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the Constitution. Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist governments in considering decisions that may involve constitutional takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This chapter is further intended and shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet preserve the ability of Syracuse City to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its other duties and functions.

8.05.010 General purpose.

The purpose and intent of this title is to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the incorporated territory of Syracuse City in the matter of subdivision or matters affected by subdivisions through provisions designed to:

(A) Provide for the harmonious and coordinated development of the City, and to assure sites suitable for subdivision development and human habitation.

(B) Ensure adequate open space for traffic, recreation, light and air.

(C) Facilitate the conservation or production of adequate transportation, water, sanitation, drainage and energy resources.

(E) Ensure utilization of the land in the best interest of the public welfare and the neighborhood deployment of the area concerned.

This chapter is designed to inform the developer and public of the requirements and conditions necessary to obtain approval of a subdivision. To this end, all requirements, where possible, are expressly delineated in this title or other applicable ordinances. However, since it is impossible to cover every possibility, and there are some aspects which do not lend themselves to being easily articulated, this title allows the Planning Commission and City Council to impose reasonable conditions upon a developer in addition to those expressly required, so long as such conditions do not conflict with any requirements set forth in this chapter or other applicable ordinances.

(3) By depositing the specified amount of cash in a supervised bank account to which the developer has access, with the approval and signature of the City, which funds shall be used to pay for the subdivision improvements as construction is completed and evidence that no liens have been placed on the construction project. In the event it becomes necessary for the City to foreclose on the security of performance and move to complete, repair or replace the improvements as set forth below, then the City shall have access to said supervised bank account for the purpose of completing, repairing, or replacing improvements without the necessity of obtaining the approval of the developer.

(4) By any other method that is acceptable to the City; provided, that the City’s interests in assuring that the work required herein is paid for, inspected and completed in conformance with City standards are protected.

(B) The security of performance required by this section is to assure the City that all improvements are constructed in conformance with all relevant City ordinances, regulations, and standards, and to assure the City that all expenses incurred for labor or material used in the construction of the same are paid for by the developer. Further, the City shall retain 10 percent of the security of performance guarantee provided by the developer until one year following the final inspection by the City Engineer.

(C) In the event construction of the public improvements is not completed or is not completed in a satisfactory manner one year from the date the final plat was approved by the City Council, the City may proceed to install the improvements in a satisfactory manner at the developer’s expense by foreclosing on the developer’s security of performance held by the City.

In the event the public improvements fail to meet the standards as set forth in the developer’s written guarantee, the City shall so notify the developer who shall be given a reasonable time to repair or otherwise correct as requested. The City may proceed to repair or replace the unsatisfactory improvements at the developer’s expense by foreclosing on any security of performance still held by the City; and, in addition, the City may avail itself of any other remedy provided to it under the laws of the state of Utah and of the City of Syracuse. In addition to any other remedies stated herein, the City shall not approve additional phases for development if the developer has not completed improvements in a satisfactory manner within one year from the date of final plat approval.

(c) Wetlands that are mitigated or filled in are not eligible for exemption under this subsection.

(E) Dedication and Conveyances of Water Rights and Water Shares to Cease Upon Determination of Excess Water Supply. At least every 10 years the Public Works Director shall determine whether the City’s existing available water holdings exceed the water holdings needed to meet the reasonable future water requirement of the city in the next 40 years by the public within the City’s projected service area based on projected population growth and other water use demand (“reasonable future water requirements”). Should the Public Works Director conclude that available water holdings exceed the reasonable future water requirements of the public, the Public Works Director shall notify the City Council and the City Council shall act to cease dedication and conveyance of water shares and water rights according to this section until existing available water holdings no longer exceed the reasonable future water requirements.

(F) Ineligible Shares. Shares in water companies are not acceptable to the City for purposes of subsections (A) and (B) of this section if they:

(1) Are shares in a water company that does not physically deliver water within Syracuse City, as determined by the City Engineer;

(2) Do not entitle the shareholder to receive a certain amount of water, or only provide for transportation or conveyance of water; or

(3) The water company does not transfer the shares to the City on the books and records of the water company to show the City as the shareholder or the water company does not issue a new share certificate showing the City as the owner of the shares transferred.

(G) Ineligible Water Rights. Water rights are not acceptable to the City for the purposes of subsections (A) and (B) of this section if:

(1) The City does not receive good and insurable title to the water rights as determined in the sole discretion of the City and a policy of water title insurance insuring the City’s title to the water rights; or

(2) Any final and nonappealable administrative approval necessary for the City to utilize and beneficially use the water under the water right, in the City’s secondary water system, has not been issued by the State Engineer of Utah.

(H) Option for Fee in Lieu of Dedication. At the developer’s option, the developer may provide a payment of a fee in lieu of dedicating and conveying water rights or water shares as a project improvement, in satisfaction of up to 50 percent of the shares or rights required by subsection (A) or (B) of this section, as applicable, only if all the following circumstances are applicable:

(1) The City has a contract in place with a water supplier for delivery of irrigation water on an ongoing basis that allows the City to upon request increase the water purchased from that supplier in an amount equal or greater than the water dedication and conveyance being replaced by the payment of the fee in lieu, subject to the payment of annual assessments to the water supplier;

(2) The fee in lieu paid by the developer is equal to 12 years of assessments for the water acquired by the City from the water supplier to replace dedication of water rights or water shares. The amount of the fee in lieu shall be calculated by determining the volume of water required to be dedicated and conveyed under this section. The amount of the fee in lieu shall be calculated by the City on the volume of water replaced by the fee in lieu contractual obligations, historical and current assessments for purchase of water from the water supplier, the known or estimated value of water shares available through irrigation companies, and projections for assessment increases by the water supplier; and

(3) All water rights or water shares associated with or used by the land under development are being dedicated to the City, there are insufficient water rights or shares associated with the historic water use on the parcel, and the developer presents evidence demonstrating that water rights previously associated with or utilized for the land or the landowner have not been sold during the previous five years.

(I) Contest of Calculated Fee in Lieu. An applicant may contest the calculated fee in lieu to the City Council by bringing evidence that the market rate for shares that would otherwise be dedicated is not roughly equivalent to the calculated fee. The Council, if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the fee is not roughly equivalent, may thereafter reduce the fee to one that is roughly equivalent to the market share price.

(A) Payback Agreement.

(1) The City may enter into a payback agreement with a developer who installs improvements or facilities for water, secondary water, land drains, storm sewer, roads, or parks, where the improvements installed extend, expand, or improve the City’s water, secondary water, land drains, sewer, storm sewer, roads, or parks, beyond the improvements required to service or benefit the subdivision or development proposed by the developer or where a developer installs improvements due to the layout or ownership of the land that benefit another landowner or developer who would or should in equity normally pay a portion of the improvements. The payback agreement is not mandatory, but may be used at the option of the City upon approval of the payback agreement by the City Council.

(2) The dollar amount of the payback to the developer shall be solely determined by the City under the direction of the City Engineer after consideration of the portion of the improvements or facilities installed that benefit the developer’s development, and the portion of the improvements or facilities that are specifically oversized or installed to provide for future development or benefit other landowners or future developers.

(3) The City shall, in all cases, be immune and not liable for any payments to the developer if the payback agreement is determined to be unenforceable or if the City is not able to collect from future developers. At the time a payback agreement is entered into with a developer, the City shall record a notice against the benefited property with the county recorder’s office, which notice shall inform the benefited landowners that at such time as they develop the benefited property they will be required to pay for a portion of the improvements previously installed.

(4) The payback agreement shall not confer a benefit upon any third party and shall be in a form approved by the City Administrator or his designee. The responsibility for payment of the required improvements or facilities shall rest entirely with the developer.

(5) The payback agreement shall expire 10 years from the date of the payback agreement or at such time as the developer has recovered the costs specified in the payback agreement, whichever comes first.

(6) If any part of this title is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, or if the Legislature of the state of Utah should pass a law which would invalidate any portion of this title, all parties to the payback agreement shall be released from further responsibility thereunder and shall be relieved from any and all responsibility thereunder.

(2) A temporary turnaround meeting the minimum requirements set forth in the International Fire Code and approved by the Fire Department shall be constructed at the end of the dead-end road. Any lot being subdivided containing a temporary turnaround cannot have a dwelling constructed on it until the road no longer meets the criteria for a dead-end street or a temporary cul-de-sac has been constructed outside the subdivision boundary.

(C) Blocks shall be wide enough to adequately accommodate a minimum of two lots.

(D) The Planning Commission may require pedestrian walkways to be constructed within a development, to facilitate access to designated points of interest. Such walkways increase pedestrian safety, reduce travel time, improve neighborhood connectivity, and encourage walking. Points of interest may include, but are not limited to: churches, civic destinations, schools, adjoining neighborhoods, parks, and commercial areas. The Planning Commission shall designate points of interest that will require a pedestrian walkway connection during the preliminary plat or site plan approval stage of entitlement.

(1) Walkways shall be designed to be a minimum of six feet up to nine feet in width to allow adequate two-way passing but may be required to be wider where determined necessary by the Planning Commission or city administrative land-use authority based on estimated usage. The developer shall surface the full width of the walkway with either concrete or asphalt.

(2) Fencing is not required, however if fencing is installed next to the trail it is required to be chain link or 50 percent open rail/slat vinyl. An additional six inches of concrete is required on each side of the walkway to embed the base of the fencing posts. All other non-open fencing must be offset 10 feet from the trail. 

(3) Maintenance of the walkway will be the responsibility of either the subdivision’s HOA, or the City, if an HOA does not exist. Snow removal is not necessary for walkways, and signage notifying pedestrians of the lack of winter maintenance shall be prominently placed at the entrances to the walkways.

(4) Please refer to the following image for the walkway dimensions.
[IMAGE]


(E) Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be designated specifically for such purposes with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and delivery facilities.

(G) All lots shown on the preliminary and final plats must conform to the minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zone or proposed zone in which the subdivision is located, and to the minimum requirements of the county Board of Health for water supply and sewage disposal.

(H) Each lot shall abut on a street shown on the subdivision plat or on an existing publicly dedicated street. Double frontage lots shall be prohibited except where unusual conditions make other designs undesirable.

(I) Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles, or radial to the street lines.

(J) In general, all remnants of lots below minimum size must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.

(K) Subdivision boundaries shall include all property; no protection or holding strips will be allowed. All improvements shall be installed to the boundary of the subdivision.

(L) Cul-de-sacs (a street having only one outlet that terminates at the other end by a vehicle turnaround) shall be no longer than 500 feet from the centerline of the adjoining street to the center of the turnaround. Each cul-de-sac must be terminated by a turnaround of not less than 110 feet in diameter, measured to the property lines.

(M) When a dead-end street reaches its maximum block length of 1,320 feet, it shall not be extended except to connect to another street which provides a second point of independent access.

(N) Private streets shall only be permitted in PRD and cluster subdivisions. Private streets shall meet the minimum construction standards established for publicly dedicated streets with the standard right-of-way requirement. Pavement widths less than 35 feet may be permitted, when the private street ties into a minor collector street or greater, and does not terminate in a cul-de-sac. Private streets shall be perpetually maintained by a professionally managed homeowners’ association as established within an approved development agreement. The purpose of a private street is not to provide a street which is substandard in construction to public streets, but one that allows for private gated access and maintenance for the exclusive use and benefit of the residents residing on said private street.

(B) Buffering. In addition to fencing ditches and canals the developer shall be required to provide adequate buffering as outlined in the City’s zoning ordinance. 

(C) Trees. Wherever feasible and practical and upon recommendation of the City Forester, the developer shall incorporate existing landscape features, especially established trees, into the design of the subdivision. [Ord. 14-23 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 13-02 § 1 (Exhibit); amended 1997; Code 1971 § 8-3-3.]

9.20.010 Findings of fact.

(A) The flood hazard areas of Syracuse City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(B) These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. [Ord. 07-17 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 9-4-010.]


9.20.020 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of Syracuse, Utah, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

(A) To protect human life and health;

(B) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(C) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(D) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(E) To minimize damage to the public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas;

(F) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

(G) To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area; and

(H) To ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume responsibility for their actions. [Ord. 07-17 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 9-4-020.]


9.20.030 Methods for reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

(A) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in excessive increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

(B) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

(C) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of channel flood waters;

(D) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

(E) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. [Ord. 07-17 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 9-4-030.]


9.20.040 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Alluvial fan flooding” means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.

“Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar land form below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

“Appurtenant structure” means a structure which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Appurtenant structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of appurtenant structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay sheds.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AH, AO, or VO zone with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

“Base flood elevation” means the computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood. Base flood elevations (BFEs) are shown on flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and on the flood profiles.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system.

“Critical feature” means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials located within the special flood hazard area.

“Elevated building” means:

(1) A nonbasement building which is:

(a) Built, in the case of a building in Zones A1 – 30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1 – 30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and

(b) Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood.

(2) In the case of Zones A1 – 30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, “elevated building” also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters.

“Existing construction” means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. “Existing construction” may also be referred to as “existing structures.”

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

“Expansion to existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

(1) The overflow of inland or tidal waters;

(2) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or

(3) Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in subsection (2) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.

“Flood elevation study” means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards.

“Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Flood protection system” means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a “special flood hazard” and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

“Floodplain” or “floodprone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”).

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.

(4) Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: (a) by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or (b) directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Hydrodynamic loads” means forces imposed on structures by flood waters due to the impact of moving water on the upstream side of the structure, drag along its sides, and eddies or negative pressures on its downstream side.

“Hydrostatic loads” means loads or pressures resulting from the static mass of water at any point of floodwater contact with a structure. They are equal in all directions and always act perpendicular to the surface on which they are applied.

“Levee” means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

“New construction” means, for purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the City’s initial FIRM, or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is: (1) built on a single chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Special flood hazard area” means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading or filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

(1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local Code Enforcement Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

(2) Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter in accordance with Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.

“Violation” means failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this chapter.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. [Ord. 07-17 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 9-4-040.]

9.20.100 Variance procedure.

(A) The Syracuse City Council is hereby designated to hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

(B) The applicant shall have the right to a hearing before the Syracuse City Council on the question of whether or not the request for the variance fulfills the variance requirements of this chapter. The City Council shall render a decision denying the variance, granting the variance, or granting the variance with conditions.

(C) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Syracuse City Council may appeal such decision to the court of competent jurisdiction.

(D) The City shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director shall report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

(E) In passing upon applications for a variance, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, those specific factors established in SCC 9.20.080(B), the intent and purpose of this chapter, and the following conditions:

(1) Due to the dangers caused by flooding to human life and property and the costs and hardship caused thereby, only under limited circumstances may variances be granted in Syracuse City. Variances shall only be issued upon:

(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to human life and public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.

(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(4) Variances shall only be issued when a determination has been made that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(5) Variances issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use may only be granted provided the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased risk to life and property and an increase in premium rates for flood insurance, which may be substantial and will be commensurate with the risk of construction below the base flood level. Insurance rates may amount up to as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage. This notice shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in subsection (D) of this section.

(7) All variances shall include a condition that the applicant sign an assumption of risk and waiver of liability agreement, in a form acceptable to the City, absolving Syracuse City of any and all liability in the event flood damage occurs to that portion of a structure for which the variance is granted. This agreement shall be recorded in the office of the Davis County recorder, shall run with the land, and shall be binding upon all future owners thereof.

(F) The Syracuse City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary and which fulfill the criteria of the variance provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 07-17 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 9-4-100.]


9.20.110 General standards.

In all special flood hazard areas the following standards are required:

The City may, instead of withholding or denying an authorization, grant such authorization subject to the condition that the violation be corrected. The provisions of this section shall apply regardless of whether the original applicant or current owner is responsible for the violation in question.

(B) Revoke Permits. Any permit may be revoked when the Land Use Administrator or his designee determines that actions taken thereunder do not conform to plans, specifications, or conditions of the permit; that the same was procured by false representation or was issued by mistake; or that any of the provisions of this title are being violated.

(1) Written notice of such revocation shall be served upon the owner, his or her agent, or contractor, or upon any person employed at the site of the building or structure for which such permit was issued, or shall be posted in a prominent location; and, thereafter, no such construction shall proceed.

(2) Upon revocation of a building permit which was issued by mistake, the owner shall meet with the Land Use Administrator or his designee to determine in what respect a mistake was made. When plans are in conflict with ordinances, resolutions, regulations, or requirements, and when construction has not progressed to a stage where modification of the plans would require substantial alteration of the structures in place, the plans shall be modified to conform to all applicable requirements. When construction has progressed to a stage where compliance would require substantial alteration of construction in place, the owner shall meet with the Land Use Administrator or his designee to negotiate possible changes in the plans which would more nearly conform to applicable ordinances, resolutions, regulations, or requirements.

(3) When a mistake has been made calculating the fee for any permit, the proper fee shall be charged.

(C) Stop Work. In accordance with its power to stop work under the building code, the City may stop work, with or without revoking permits, on any building or structure on any land on which exists an uncorrected violation of a provision of this title or permit or other form of authorization issued hereunder.

(D) Revoke Plan or Other Approvals. Where a violation of this title involves failure to comply with approved plans or conditions upon which the approval of such plans was made subject, the City may, upon notice to the applicant and other known parties in interest (including any holders of building permits affected) and after a hearing, revoke the plan or other approval, or condition its continuance on strict compliance, the provision of security, or such other conditions as the City may reasonably impose.

(E) Remove Signs. When a sign is illegally located within a City right-of-way, on any City-owned property, or in the case of an emergency or an identified hazard, the Land Use Administrator or his designee may, without notice, cause the immediate removal of such dangerous or defective sign which presents a hazard to the public or which is in the public right-of-way.

(1) Such action by the City shall be at the expense of the owner and shall include the actual cost of repair or removal of the sign, plus 15 percent of such amount for administrative and overhead costs.

(2) If the owner fails to pay the amount due within 30 days from the date of billing, the City may initiate legal action against the owner as provided by law to collect such costs and expenses, including interest at the legal rate and reasonable attorney’s fees.

(F) Injunctive Relief. The City may seek an injunction or other equitable relief in the district court to stop any violation of this title or of a permit, certificate, or other form of authorization granted hereunder.

(G) Abatement. The City may seek a court order from the district court in the nature of mandamus, abatement, or other action or proceeding to abate or remove a violation or to otherwise restore the premises in question to the condition in which they existed prior to the violation.

(H) Penalties. Violation of any of the provisions of this title shall upon conviction be punishable as a Class C misdemeanor.

(I) Other Remedies. The City shall have such other remedies as are and as may be from time to time provided by Utah law or City ordinance for the violation of any provision of this title.

(J) Remedies Cumulative. These remedies shall be cumulative. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 1991; Code 1971 § 10-3-080.]


10.15.090 Exactions (constitutional takings).

The City shall carefully consider each claim, in fairness to any private property owner who believes a constitutional taking occurred, in view of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging a constitutional taking. However, the City shall preserve the ability to lawfully require dedication or exaction of property consistent with federal and state Constitutions. The criteria set forth in this title shall be objectively and fairly construed in reviewing any claim that a specific action by the City requires payment of just compensation, and decisions rendered shall be advisory and neither expand or limit the scope of the City’s liability for a constitutional taking. The City may impose an exaction or exactions on proposed land use development if:

(A) An essential nexus exists between a legitimate governmental interest and each exaction; and

(B) Each exaction is roughly proportionate, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 10-3-090.]

(5) A use variance may not be granted.

(6) In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may impose additional requirements on an applicant that will mitigate any harmful effects of the variance, or serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived or modified.

10.20.115 Reasonable accommodations.

(A) Purpose. This section establishes procedures and standards for requests for reasonable accommodation due to disability.

(B) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section:

“Administrative Hearing Officer” means a law-trained individual who has been appointed by the Mayor, with advice and consent of the Council, to consider appeals from reasonable accommodation requests.

“Director” means the Syracuse City Director of Community and Economic Development.

“Disability” means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of a person’s major life activities, including a person having a record of such a problem or being regarded as having such an impairment. It does not include current illegal use of, and/or resulting addiction to, any federally controlled substance as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 802, or as defined under Title 58, Chapter 37, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended.

“Major life activities” means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working.

“Physical or mental impairment” includes the following:

(1) Any psychological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, including speech organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine;

(2) Any mental or physiological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities; or

(3) Diseases or conditions such as orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, drug addiction (other than addiction caused by current, illegal use of controlled substances), and alcoholism.

“Reasonable accommodation” means a change in any rule, policy, practice, or service that is necessary to afford a person with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

(C) An applicant who wishes to make a request for a reasonable accommodation must provide the following to the Director, in writing:

(1) The name, mailing address, and phone number or email of the applicant;

(2) The nature and extent of the disability;

(3) An exact statement of the ordinance or policy from which the applicant needs a reasonable accommodation;

(4) The applicant’s proposed reasonable accommodation;

(5) A statement detailing why such reasonable accommodation is necessary; and

(6) The physical address of the property where the applicant requests the reasonable accommodation.

(D) The Director’s authority to hear reasonable accommodation requests for zoning regulations is nondelegable.

(E) The burden of production and persuasion rests upon the applicant to establish the existence of a disability and that the requested relief is a reasonable accommodation.

(F) In determining whether an accommodation is reasonable, the Director determines whether the requested accommodation meets three main criteria:

(1) Reasonableness. An accommodation is reasonable if it will not undermine the legitimate purpose of existing zoning regulations notwithstanding the benefit that the accommodation will provide to a person with a disability.

(2) Necessity. An accommodation must be necessary, meaning that, but for the accommodation, one or more persons with a disability likely will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing of their choice.

(3) Equal Opportunity. The accommodation achieves equal results as between a person with a disability and a nondisabled person.

(4) In considering these three criteria, the Director shall consider the following facts, as applicable:

(a) Applicable zoning ordinances;

(b) Anticipated traffic, parking, and noise impact on the neighborhood if the accommodation is granted;

(c) Whether the accommodation will be an undue burden or expense to the City;

(d) The extent to which the accommodation will or will not benefit the applicant;

(e) The extent to which the accommodation will or will not benefit the community;

(f) Whether the accommodation fundamentally alters the citywide zoning ordinance and whether or not the accommodation would likely create a fundamental change in the character of a residential neighborhood;

(g) Whether the applicant has demonstrated that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance the applicant’s life or ameliorate the effects of the applicant’s disability, or the lives or disabilities of those on whose behalf the applicant is applying;

(h) Whether or not, without accommodation, similar housing is available in the City for the applicant or group of applicants;

(i) The anticipated impact of the accommodation on the immediate neighborhood; and

(j) Any other requirements of applicable federal or state laws and regulations.

(G) The Director shall render a written decision within 30 calendar days after the application is received by the Director, and send a copy of that decision to the mailing address or email address provided by the applicant. An additional 30 days are available if the Director determines that the request is complicated or requires more extensive study, or if the process was delayed by the applicant.

(H) Appeal from the Director’s decision may be made by an aggrieved person with standing to an Administrative Hearing Officer for the City, within 10 business days after the decision is rendered. Notice of appeal is made by delivering a copy of the notice to the City Recorder.

(1) The Administrative Hearing Officer shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to the advice and consent of the City Council, as provided in Chapter 2.25 SCC.

(2) The Administrative Hearing Officer shall be compensated for their services on a per-hearing or per-hour basis, as established upon appointment.

(3) The Administrative Hearing Officer shall either have graduated from an accredited law school, or have significant experience with the requirements and operation of administrative hearing processes. The officer shall be free from any bias or conflict of interest that might affect impartiality of decisions.

(I) The Administrative Hearing Officer hears the case de novo, applying the same standard and receiving testimony and evidence. The Administrative Hearing Officer shall render a written decision to the applicant within 30 days of the hearing. Appeals from the Administrative Hearing Officer’s decision may be made by an aggrieved person with standing to the Second District Court of Utah, within 30 calendar days of the decision. [Ord. 20-04 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 17-22 § 2 (Exh. A).]

(3) An appeal to the Board of Adjustment, Planning Commission, or City Council shall not stay proceedings taken in furtherance of the action appealed, unless such proceedings are specifically stayed by order of the Land Use Administrator. An appellant may request a stay by submitting to the Land Use Administrator, in writing, a request for a stay setting forth the reasons why a stay is necessary to protect against imminent harm. In determining whether or not to grant a stay, the Land Use Administrator shall assure that all potentially affected parties are given the opportunity to comment on the request. A ruling on the request for a stay shall be given within five days from the submittal date to the Land Use Administrator. The Land Use Administrator, in granting a stay, may impose additional conditions to mitigate any potential harm caused by the stay, including requiring the appellant to post a bond. Within 10 days of the Land Use Administrator’s decision regarding the grant or denial of a stay, any aggrieved party may appeal the decision to the appellate body with jurisdiction over the appeal, whose decision will be final.

(4) The appellate body shall conduct a hearing based upon the record only, taking no new testimony or new information but relying solely upon the information and final decision of the officer or body from whom the appeal was taken. The appellate body shall thereafter affirm or reverse, wholly or in part, the lower decision, modify that decision, or impose any conditions needed to conform the matter appealed to applicable approval standards. If the prior decision is supported by substantial evidence, the appellate body shall affirm that decision.

10.20.140 Land use decisions and appeal process.

This chapter shall not nullify the more restrictive provisions of covenants, agreements, other ordinances, or laws but shall prevail over provisions that are less restrictive. The City shall not impose, on a holder of an approved land use permit, a requirement not expressed in the applicable land use permit, documents on which the City based its approval of the land use permit, or any of the City’s adopted ordinances. The City is bound by the terms and standards of its land use ordinances and shall comply with mandatory provisions of same. Table 1 reflects the proper procedures governing land use decisions and appeals. Land use applicants shall have 15 days to appeal any decision to the appropriate appellate body. If the applicant desires to continue the appeal beyond the decision of the appellate body, they must file such appeal with the District Court within 30 days from the date on which the appellate body rendered its decision.

Chapter 10.25 NONCONFORMING LOTS AND USES AND NONCOMPLYING STRUCTURES

Sections:

10.25.010    Intent.

10.25.020    Continuation.

10.25.030    Determination of nonconformance.

10.25.040    Nonconforming lots of record.

10.25.100    Extension of time for recovery of investment.


10.25.010 Intent.

Within the zones established by this title, or amendments thereto, building lots, structures, and/or uses of land and structures lawfully existed before the City Council adopted or amended this title that prohibits, regulates, or restricts said lots, structures, and uses thereon under the terms of this current title. It is the intent of this title to permit these nonconformities to continue until such time as they are changed, amended, or abandoned.

This chapter declares nonconforming uses or noncomplying structures to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zone involved. However, to avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building or land on which actual construction or use lawfully began prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment to this title and is diligently pursued. This title defines “actual construction” as the placement of construction materials in a permanent position and fastening in a permanent manner. Where excavation, demolition, or removal of an existing building substantially began preparatory to rebuilding, this title shall deem such excavation, demolition, or removal to be actual construction, provided the builders carry on the work diligently. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 1991; Code 1971 § 10-5-010.]


10.25.020 Continuation.

A nonconforming use or noncomplying structure, legally existing when it became prohibited, may continue as provided in this chapter. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 10-5-020.]


10.25.030 Determination of nonconformance.

Pursuant to the procedures set forth in SCC 10.20.110, the Land Use Authority shall determine all matters regarding noncomplying structures or the nonconforming use of lots, buildings, and land and whether they are noncompliant with respect to current provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; Code 1971 § 10-5-030.]


10.25.040 Nonconforming lots of record.

In any zone, notwithstanding other limitations imposed by this title, builders may erect structures permitted in said zone on any single legal building lot of record that does not conform to lot area or lot width requirements of the zone on the effective date of this title. A lot of record that does not meet lot area or lot width requirements must still meet the other requirements of the zone.

Where lots are larger than required by this title, the land owner may subdivide said lots into smaller lots, unless the division would create a lot smaller in lot width or lot area than required by this title. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 1991; Code 1971 § 10-5-040.]


10.25.050 Nonconforming uses of land.

Where, at the time of passage of this title or amendments thereto, the lawful use of land exists that this title no longer permits, the use may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:

(A) No one enlarges or increases such nonconforming use or extends such use to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title.

(B) No one moves in whole or in part such nonconforming use to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title.

(C) Any such nonconforming use of land does not cease for any reason for a period of more than one year; otherwise, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the zone in which such land resides.

(D) No one erects additional nonconforming structures in connection with such nonconforming uses of land. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; Code 1971 § 10-5-050.]


10.25.060 Noncomplying structures.

Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title that could not lawfully be built under the new terms of this title by reason of restriction on lot area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

(A) No one may alter or enlarge such noncomplying structure in any way which increases its nonconformity, but may alter any noncomplying structure or portion thereof to decrease its nonconformity.

(B) Such structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district wherein the structure is located if it moves for any reason for any distance. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 1991; Code 1971 § 10-5-060.]


10.25.070 Nonconforming uses of structures.

The lawful use of a structure or structures and premises, existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title, that the new provisions of said ordinance no longer allow in the zone may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful, providing that:

(A) No one shall enlarge, extend, construct, or structurally alter an existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use without changing the use to a permitted use.

(B) Any nonconforming use may be extended to any other part of a building designed for such use; provided, that:

(1) No structural alteration to the building is made for the purpose of extending the use; and

(2) The nonconforming use does not extend in any way to occupy land outside the structure.

(C) Nonconforming uses of buildings, structures, or premises that change to another nonconforming use must receive approval from the Planning Commission. In determining whether or not to grant approval, the Planning Commission shall determine the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use.

(D) Any noncomplying structure or nonconforming lot or use of a structure and/or land superseded by a permitted structure or use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zone in which it resides, and the noncomplying structure and/or nonconforming use may not thereafter resume.

(E) Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure or premises ceases for one year, no one shall use the structure or premises thereafter except in conformity with the regulations of the zone in which it resides. The term “ceases” as used in this subsection shall mean that the activity in question has not been in operation for a period of one year.

(F) Overcoming Presumption of Abandonment. A presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon evidence presented by the owner showing no intent to abandon the use, structure, or other nonconformity. Such evidence may include proof that, during the alleged period of abandonment, the owner did either of the following:

(1) Maintained the lot and structure, if any, in accordance with the building code; or

(2) Actively and continuously marketed the lot or structure for sale or lease. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 1991; Code 1971 § 10-5-070.]


10.25.080 Repairs and maintenance.

The City may prohibit the reconstruction or restoration of a noncomplying structure or terminate its nonconforming use if the structure deteriorates to a condition that renders it uninhabitable. The City shall mail written notice of such intent to the property owner granting such owner six months from the date of mailing in which to repair or restore the structure to its original condition. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 1991; Code 1971 § 10-5-080.]


10.25.090 Nonconforming uses or noncomplying structures detrimental to health and safety.

No provisions of this chapter shall be construed to allow the continuance of any nonconforming use or noncomplying structure when it is detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the public. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 10-5-090.]


10.25.100 Extension of time for recovery of investment.

The Land Use Administrator may suspend any requirement that a nonconforming use, lot, or parcel or noncomplying structure or other nonconformity come into compliance with the provisions of this title if the owner of the affected property demonstrates that they have not recovered or amortized the amount of their investment in the nonconforming use, lot, or parcel or noncomplying structure or other nonconformity.

(A) Written Request for Extension Required. A property owner shall submit a written request to the Land Use Administrator for an extension of time needed to recover their investment in the affected property.

(B) Information Required. The following information shall accompany the request:

(1) The amount of the owner’s investment in the use, structure, lot, parcel, or other nonconformity from the time it became nonconforming.

(2) The amount of such investment realized to date and an estimate of the amount to be realized on the date the time limit expires.

(3) Evidence of any lease or purchase obligations undertaken in reliance on any previously issued licenses or permits applying to the use, structure, lot, parcel, or other nonconformity, including any contingency clauses therein permitting termination of such lease. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Code 1971 § 10-5-100.]


Chapter 10.28 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW COMMITTEE AND DESIGN STANDARDS

Sections:

10.28.010    Purpose.

10.28.020    Architectural Review Committee (ARC).

10.28.100    Commercial, professional office, and public facility developments.

10.28.110    Building design.

10.28.220    Industrial architecture.

10.28.230    Industrial landscape design.


10.28.010 Purpose.

(A) The purpose of the design standards outlined in this chapter is to facilitate exceptional design in the built environment and preserve the quality of life within Syracuse City. This chapter is based on the following principles:

(1) Higher quality designs will bring value to the commercial community of Syracuse and attract businesses which positively contribute to the overall quality of life and well-being of Syracuse residents.

(2) Syracuse welcomes a variety of businesses and recognizes that brand recognition has become an important aspect of developing a successful and competitive business. The design standards enumerated in this chapter are intended to help and encourage development of imaginative and unique design solutions which meet business needs, while at the same time preserving Syracuse’s unique history and community identity.

(3) This chapter supplements the objectives of other chapters in this title which also impose certain design standards or requirements that are zone specific.

(B) This chapter references design standards and design guidelines. They are intended to improve the quality and compatibility of development, particularly with regard to building design and site design.

(1) Design Standards. Design standards are required in addition to other standards set forth in this title. Design standards are intended to ensure quality development and permanence in design. The implementation of these standards ensures that the goals and values of the community are reflected in each commercial development and contribute positively to the overall built environment.

(2) Design Guidelines. Design guidelines offer examples to clarify and explain design standards. They are made available for public use and distribution within a separate manual that can be found on record in the Community Development Department. The purpose of the Syracuse City Commercial Design Standards and Guidelines Manual is to better clarify the relationship between design standards and guidelines. The design guidelines serve to graphically represent the design standards and are used as a reference tool in order to better illustrate the application of the design standards. [Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.020 Architectural Review Committee (ARC).

The ARC is established to review all applicable development plans for compliance with the design standards in this chapter. This committee functions as a subcommittee of the Planning Commission and consists of seven members appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the City Council in accordance with the Syracuse Municipal Code. Members consist of community residents, Planning Commissioners (maximum two), and City staff. The Planning Commission Chair may recommend candidates for the Mayor’s consideration.

The ARC is responsible to review the plan, elevations, architectural details, and development design pattern book and make recommendations to the Planning Commission consistent with this chapter. The Planning Commission will, in turn, submit their recommendations to the City Council. [Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.100 Commercial, professional office, and public facility developments.

(A) Applicability. The design standards set forth in SCC 10.28.110 and 10.28.120 apply to:

(1) All new commercial, professional office or public facilities buildings and uses except where the requirements of this chapter are superseded by another provision of this title.

(2) Existing commercial, professional office, or public buildings and uses when a change occurs that involves a design standard set forth in this chapter and either:

(a) Requires a building or other permit issued by the City;

(b) Alters the occupancy designation of a building under the current building codes adopted by the City;

(c) Increases required parking; or

(d) Increases the amount of outside storage.

(B) Imposition of Conditions. When reviewing a development plan, the Architectural Review Committee (ARC) may recommend that the Planning Commission impose conditions consistent with design standards in this chapter.

(C) Other Code Requirements. The requirements of this chapter apply in addition to other applicable requirements of this title. [Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.110 Building design.

(A) Context. All building designs are required to be drafted with sensitivity to the design of nearby buildings and developments. This sensitivity includes considering whether:

(1) Buildings contribute to the overall character of Syracuse and the neighborhood;

(2) Buildings reflect the character of surrounding development through use of some similar features;

(3) Buildings demonstrate imaginative design; and

(4) Buildings vary colors, materials, or architectural elements where proposed building designs closely copy or mirror surrounding developments.

(B) Entrances. All building entrances are required to be clearly articulated to indicate a transition from the exterior to the interior of the building. Every main entrance is required to have a special emphasis when compared to the other portions of the building. This is accomplished through the use of at least three of the following near entrances:

(1) A prominent architectural feature that is unique to the overall building design;

(2) Complimentary yet differing building materials or colors;

(3) Increased use of windows or glass;

(4) Pedestrian amenities that may include patios, porches, special paving treatments, seating areas, or awnings; or

(5) Increased landscaping.

(C) Facade Articulation. Buildings designed with completely flat facades and monotone color schemes are not permitted. All buildings are required to have articulation of all facades.

(1) Horizontal or vertical facade variations must occur at least every 30 feet or along a minimum of 60 percent of the horizontal length of buildings with facades 100 feet or greater. This is accomplished by using methods such as:

(a) Variation in the surface plane that may include pop-outs, bays, and recesses;

(b) Variation in the surface pattern such as arches, banding, and paneling; or

(c) Distinguished treatment of windows, doors, and eaves that may include molding or framing.

(2) Buildings with facades 100 feet or greater in total length must have at least one significant facade variation from the primary wall plane whose depth is at least five percent of the total facade length and whose width is at least 20 percent of the total facade length. Uninterrupted facades 100 feet or greater in length are prohibited.

(D) Height and Roofline. All building roof heights will be compatible with the building’s location, and varied roofline elevations or parapets are required in order to add architectural interest and avoid the appearance or sense of monotonous roofline expanses. All buildings are required to:

(1) Have appropriate roof height for the location based on zoning regulations and the height of buildings within the immediate area;

(2) Have roofline and parapet variations where there are long, continuous, and undisturbed rooflines 50 feet in length or greater;

(3) Use similar materials and colors on the back of false fronts, parapets, cornices, or other parts of the building which extend beyond the roofline or main building so that the building appears cohesive from all views; and

(4) Have screening of mechanical equipment and systems that will be mounted on the roof. Any portion of these pieces of equipment that is not fully shielded is required to be painted a color which is compatible with the roofing or parapet materials.

(E) Massing. Proper massing reduces the impact of the massive bulk created by large buildings that may not otherwise relate in scale to surrounding development. Vertical articulation, horizontal articulation, and multi-planed roof or awnings must be used in designs to mitigate the impact on surrounding development and the overall landscape.

(F) Materials. Quality long-lasting materials are required for all buildings in order to contribute to the aesthetics of the community over the long term.

(1) A minimum of three colors per elevation is required.

(2) Color utilization should be sensitive to existing development within the vicinity and the natural landscape in which the project is situated.

(3) Primary Materials. Sixty-five percent of all surface materials, not including glass or roofing materials, are required to include a combination of brick, stone, ceramic tile, masonry materials, insulated metal panels, or wood fiber/composite siding. Exposed cinder block is not permitted, except for minimal foundation exposure. Concrete masonry unit, exposed concrete, stucco, vinyl, wood siding, or metal components may be used as accent or secondary materials only.

(4) Exposed tilt-up concrete or insulated metal panels may be used as a primary material on buildings located in the business park zone. Some variation in materials along the base and near the entrances of concrete tilt-ups is required.

(5) All projects are required to submit a sample board containing physical samples of all exterior surface materials, including roofing materials, in all the colors they will be used. Photos alone are not sufficient.

(G) Development Design Pattern Book. The developer is required to provide a development design pattern book to be reviewed by the ARC and then the Planning Commission in conjunction with a subdivision plan and/or site plan application. Where there is a development agreement, the design pattern book will become a part of the agreement. Design pattern books are subject to the following:

(1) Written descriptions with graphic illustrations explaining how the development complements the physical form of the property and how the theme and standards found in this chapter are to be integrated into the design of the development;

(2) Written descriptions with graphic illustrations explaining the proposed conceptual architectural design, building elevations, and other such related design schemes; and

(3) Written descriptions with graphic illustrations that clearly describe proposed open spaces, landscaping ideas, pedestrian pathways, furnishings, lighting and related entryway features and/or amenities.

(H) Pedestrians. All buildings will be designed with an integral focus on encouraging pedestrian activity and social interaction. Additionally, buildings that contain more than one story or that are above 20 feet in height are required to provide a clearly articulated and more detailed base that relates to pedestrians.

(I) Signs. Signs located on any building facade are required to be compatible with the building’s overall design. As an integral design element, signs are required to be compatible with the style of the buildings in terms of location, scale, color, and lettering.

(1) The locations for signs on a building’s facade will be planned for as part of the building’s overall design.

(2) Signs located on facades should integrate similar or complementary materials as the building.

(J) Windows. Windows are key to the overall design of a building and the relationship between the exterior and interior. The majority of windows are required to relate to the scale of a person.

(1) Windows should be at eye level.

(2) Where buildings are adjacent to pedestrian walkways, transparent windows must relate the scale of the building and the building’s interior to pedestrians. Where transparent windows may not be desirable, tinted windows, false windows, or glass block are allowed.

(3) Window awnings are an effective way to add detail and variation to a building, emphasize pedestrian scale windows, and create an exciting and inviting environment. When placing awnings:

(a) Use quality materials which are durable and are able to withstand extremes in the weather;

(b) Colors should be complementary to the color of the building on which the awning is located; and

(c) Styles should be compatible with the architectural features and overall architecture of the building on which the awning is located. [Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.120 Site design.

(A) Building Placement. Building placement is integral to the site design and the overall effect any development has on surrounding properties. Building placement is required to comply with the following:

(1) All buildings must be oriented with the main or similar facade facing a principal street to which it has frontage.

(2) Buildings located on corner lots are required to orient main facades to each street and give equal treatment to each.

(3) Buildings located on corner lots should include a prominent architectural feature of greater height than the rest of the roof, or emphasis at the corner where the two public streets meet.

(B) Context. New developments are required to match or complement surrounding developments in order to create a site which relates to its surroundings and adds positively to the overall built environment in the site area.

(C) Miscellaneous. The small details that sometimes become afterthoughts of site planning and design are important factors for making aesthetically attractive sites. The following are required during initial site planning, along with any other requirements within this code:

(1) Landscaped areas and walls will be designed to decrease noise levels and separate loading and service bays from customer parking. Service and loading bays (automotive, service, tire, etc.) should be oriented away from neighboring residential areas. Further, they cannot have direct access to major public streets; access shall be provided via internal site plan circulation. The general public should be restricted from accessing such areas.

(2) Approved outdoor storage areas are required to be fully screened from view using the same materials as the building or approved masonry fencing. Enclosures are also required to be surrounded by landscaping to further soften their visual impact. Public access to these areas should be restricted.

(3) Outdoor refuse and garbage collection containers are required to be fully screened from view using the same materials as the building or approved masonry fencing. Enclosures are required to be surrounded by landscaping to further soften their visual impact. Public access to these areas should be restricted.

(4) Shopping cart corrals are highly visible and needed to keep development sites safe and orderly. Corrals are required to be in fixed position.

(5) Generators are required for businesses that the ARC determines will provide essential services to the public during inclement weather or natural disasters. Generators and other large auxiliary equipment are required to be placed at locations where they will be least intrusive in terms of noise, appearance, and odors, particularly for occupants of neighboring properties. Site plans will include public utilities equipment placement. Generators and other large auxiliary equipment:

(a) Should be kept low to the ground;

(b) If they include exhaust systems may not have exhaust systems protrude above the equipment; and

(c) Are required to be surrounded by walls, landscaping, and other screening.

(6) Site plans will be designed to conform to all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ARC shall review the site plan for adequate handicap parking and access to buildings.

(D) Landscaping. Landscaping is required as a tool to enhance and beautify the site, and the building’s architecture and design. To aid in the design process, designers are encouraged to refer to the Syracuse City Commercial Design Standards and Guidelines Manual.

(1) The portion of a development site devoted to landscaping exclusive of parkstrips and walkways will be calculated by the zone requirements for the parcel. Additional landscaping should be provided to achieve compatibility between differing, adjacent land uses such as residential and commercial, as required in the buffering table.

(2) Landscaping is required to be integrated into the design, placement, and enhancement of pedestrian plazas, sitting areas, walkways, flag poles, and signs and will comply with zoning requirements.

(3) Vegetative ground cover must be utilized for at least 80 percent of a development site’s frontage along any public right-of-way and in required landscape areas between a building and the parkstrip not including sidewalks, trails, and entry points.

(4) Drought resistant shrubs and trees will be used in conjunction with efficient low water use irrigation systems. A list of low water use plants is available from the Community Development Department.

(E) Lighting. Carefully planned lighting schemes can create safe environments for pedestrians and motorists. Lighting is an integral design element which adds to the overall site plan and building design. Lighting must be designed in compliance with Chapter 10.45 SCC (Sign and Lighting Regulations).

(1) Lighting schemes will include coordinating parking, wall, and pedestrian scaled fixtures which compliment building architecture and site features.

(2) Parking and Circulation. Lifestyle, separated land uses, and lack of sufficient public transit have created the need for parking and access for automobiles onto most commercial sites. Lighting in required parking areas must be designed to have a minimal impact on the surrounding environment.

(F) Traffic. Developments which generate significant increases in traffic will include an analysis of the proposed development’s impact on the current and future transportation system, and methods to control traffic.

(1) Major internal circulation roadways that provide access from the public right-of-way or between buildings on the same site must be separated from parking areas using curb and gutter and a combination of any of the following methods:

(a) Landscaping;

(b) Pedestrian walkways; or

(c) Lighting.

(2) Concrete “deadmen” wheel stoppers are required for parking spaces adjacent to a pedestrian walkway or amenity.

(3) Cross access for automobiles and pedestrians to future and existing commercial developments is required during initial site planning and construction.

(4) The design and location of loading areas and dock facilities must minimize the interaction between trucks and visitors’ automobiles. Access to loading and delivery areas must be separated from parking areas.

(5) The design and location of loading facilities must take into consideration the specific dimensions required for the maneuvering of large trucks and trailers into and out of loading position at docks or in stalls and driveways.

(G) Pedestrians. Site layout and design must equally address the needs of pedestrians and automobiles. Pedestrian access and safety on the site should be ensured.

(1) Pedestrian access from the public right-of-way through the site to main entrances is required. These walkways are required to be constructed of dissimilar materials to the roadway or parking area, and provide for clearly defined crossings where there are points of conflict with automobiles.

(2) Dissimilar roadway materials within parking lots are required to be used directly in front of entrances to slow motorists and create a safer environment for pedestrians.

(3) Pedestrian drop-off locations, when incorporated within overall circulation patterns, are required to be convenient and safe for pedestrians.

(H) Security. Security of the site is required to be addressed in site design. The developer is required to submit documents that demonstrate the security measures of the site design in relation to private, semi-public and public areas, by utilizing natural surveillance, access control and proper maintenance. [Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.200 Industrial developments.

The design guidelines in SCC 10.28.210 through 10.28.230 are applicable to all new industrial and warehouse developments in the City as well as additions to and exterior remodeling of existing buildings where the improvements are visible from a public right-of-way. [Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.210 Industrial site planning.

Site planning considers how the various components of a development (e.g., buildings, circulation, parking, open space, etc.) relate to adjacent streets and existing development, and how the various components relate to each other within the development site.

(A) Building and Facilities Location. The main elements of a well-designed industrial site include:

(1) Controlled site access with appropriate maneuvering areas for trucks separated from general vehicle circulation (1 in figure below).

(2) Employee parking areas located apart from loading and service areas (2 in figure below).

(3) Convenient public access and short-term visitor parking at the front of the building (3 in figure below).

(4) Screening of storage, work areas, and mechanical equipment and buffering of adjacent land uses (4 in figure below).

(5) Emphasis on a well-designed main building entry and landscaping (5 in figure below).
[IMAGE]


Example of appropriate industrial site layout

(6) Site elements, such as buildings, parking, driveways, and outdoor activities, should be arranged to emphasize the more aesthetically pleasing components of the site (e.g., landscaping and superior architectural features) and disguise less attractive elements (e.g., service facilities, outside storage, equipment areas, and refuse enclosures) through proper placement and design of buildings, screen walls, and landscaping.


[IMAGE]


(7) Industrial and warehouse development must be screened and buffered from any adjacent uses that are less intensive in compliance with the code. Intensified landscaping, increased setbacks, and appropriate building location will be utilized as a means of providing adequate separation between land uses of varied intensity.

Outdoor storage areas – screened from view


[IMAGE]


(8) Noise generating functions must be located in a way that minimizes any impact on adjacent nonindustrial properties. Sound attenuation walls should be used where appropriate to mitigate/reduce noise.

(9) The number of site access points are to be located at distances from street intersections that will minimize points of potential vehicle conflict, especially between automobiles and trucks.

(10) Primary entry drives for automobiles, especially visitors, must be enhanced with: ornamental landscaping, low-level decorative walls, monument-type signs, or decorative paving to emphasize site access locations.

(B) Vehicular Circulation.

(1) Site access and internal circulation must promote safety, efficiency, convenience, and minimize conflict between trucks and other vehicles. Appropriate maneuvering and stacking areas for trucks should be a primary consideration in the overall design of the circulation system.

(2) Uses where trucks are anticipated, such as distribution centers, should be planned to accommodate safety and maximize visibility for both truck maneuvering and other traffic.

(3) The design and location of loading areas and dock facilities must minimize the interaction between trucks and other automobiles. Access to loading and delivery areas must be separated from parking areas.

(4) The design and location of loading facilities must take into consideration the specific dimensions required for the maneuvering of large trucks and trailers into and out of loading position at docks or in stalls and driveways.

(C) Parking Location.

(1) Parking lots are not to be the dominant visual element at the front of the site. Expansive paved areas located between the street and the building are prohibited.

(2) Large parking areas (over 100 spaces) must be divided into smaller multiple lots and provided with trees located throughout the parking area to reduce the visual impact.

(3) Visitor parking spaces should be located to produce the shortest route of travel to a building entrance.

(4) Pedestrian walkways must provide safe, convenient, and well-defined access between parking areas and the public sidewalk and the main public access to the building.

(5) Pedestrian circulation should be clearly delineated and separate from vehicle circulation. The use of landscaping, walkways, or decorative paving to delineate pedestrian circulation must be used. [Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.220 Industrial architecture.

The architectural design of a structure must consider many variables, from the functional use of the building, to its aesthetic design, to its “fit” within the context of existing development. The following standards help buildings achieve the appropriate level of design detail on all facades, avoid blank/uninteresting facades, and provide for the proper screening of equipment and refuse areas:

(A) Architectural Form and Detail.

(1) If adjacent to a residential zoning district, in addition to the buffer requirements of this code, additional building setbacks of 10 feet must be provided adjacent to the residential use to reduce the visual impact of large-scale industrial buildings.

(2) The mass and scale of large, box-like industrial buildings are to be reduced through the incorporation of varying building heights and setbacks along the front and street sides of building facades.

(3) Front and street sides of facades of large buildings visible from a public street must include: architectural features such as reveals, windows and openings, changes in color, texture, or material to add interest to the building elevation and reduce its visual mass.

(4) Primary building entries must be readily identifiable and well defined through the use of projections, recesses, columns, roof structures, or other design elements.

(B) Color and Materials.

(1) A comprehensive material and color scheme must be developed for each site. Material and color variations in multi-building complexes must be complementary and compatible among buildings.

(2) Primary Materials. Fifteen percent of the front exterior walls and 10 percent of street facing exterior walls must be finished with brick, concrete formliner, architectural block, stone, or glass. Unfinished gray concrete block is not permitted. The use of noninsulated metal siding exclusively on any wall is prohibited. All finish material shall be durable to the effects of weather and soiling.

(3) All projects are required to submit a sample board containing physical samples of all exterior surface materials, including roofing materials, in all the colors they will be used. Photos alone are not sufficient.

(4) Large expanses of precast concrete (including cast in place concrete tilt-up panels), metal wall panels, or other uniform material must be broken up with pop outs, recesses, awnings, staggered facades, metal structures, trellis, change in color and texture, or the addition of other designed three dimensional architectural features, every 100 feet.

(5) Bright, contrasting colors should be used for small areas of building accents only.

(6) Design and colors of wall signs must be compatible with the main buildings on the site.

(7) Materials, design, and colors of monument signs must be compatible with the main buildings on the site.

(C) Accessory Buildings.

(1) The design of accessory buildings (e.g., security kiosks, maintenance buildings, and outdoor equipment enclosures) must be incorporated into and be compatible with the overall design of the project and the main buildings on the site.

(2) Temporary buildings are not to be located where they will be visible from adjoining public streets.

(3) Modular buildings must be skirted with material and color that is compatible with the modular unit and the main buildings on the site. [Ord. 16-28 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 15-27 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 13-11 § 1.]


10.28.230 Industrial landscape design.

Landscaping has a variety of functions, including softening the hard edges of development, screening unattractive views, buffering less intensive uses, providing shade, and increasing the overall aesthetic appeal of a project.

(A) Landscape Design.

(1) Landscape design must follow an overall concept and link various site components together.

(2) Landscaped areas incorporate a three-tiered planting system: (a) grasses, ground covers, or flowers; (b) shrubs or vines; and (c) trees.

(3) The use of a variety of trees, especially in parking areas and pedestrian open space areas, is required.

(4) More intense landscaping and special landscape features are to be provided at major focal points, such as entries and pedestrian gathering areas.

(5) The front, public portions of buildings must be separated from parking areas by landscaping and pedestrian walkways.

(B) Walls and Fences.

(1) The colors, materials, and appearance of walls and fences, including walls for screening purposes, must be compatible with the overall design character/style of the development.

(2) Landscaping must be used in combination with walls and fences to visually soften blank surfaces.

(3) When security fencing is required adjacent to streets, it must consist of wrought iron, tubular steel, or similar material supported by masonry piers.

(C) Outdoor Lighting.

(1) The design and location of outdoor lighting fixtures must preclude direct glare onto adjoining property and streets in compliance with the development code. Illumination devices must be installed, directed, and shielded to confine light rays within the property.

(2) Outdoor lighting (e.g., location, height, and number) must be designed to foster security. Site and building entries must have enhanced illumination to increase visibility and safety.

(D) Refuse Storage and Utility Equipment.

(1) Refuse storage areas should be located at the rear of the development and screened from public view in compliance with the development code.

(2) If refuse storage areas, fuel tanks, generators, and fire check safety valves cannot be located out of public view, the design of refuse storage areas should incorporate architectural screening elements and landscaping compatible with the design of buildings and landscaping on the site.

(C) Spacing. The spacing of street trees will be in accordance with the three species size classes listed above, and no one may plant trees closer together than the following: small trees, 30 feet; medium trees, 40 feet; and large trees, 50 feet; except that special plantings designed or approved by a landscape architect are exempt from these spacing requirements.

(D) Distance from Curb and Sidewalk. The distance trees may be planted from curbs or curb lines and sidewalks will be in accordance with the three species-sized classes listed above, and no one may plant trees closer to any curb or sidewalk than the following: small trees, two feet; medium trees, three feet; and large trees, four feet.

(E) Distance from Street Corners and Fire Hydrants. No one may plant a street tree closer than 35 feet from any street corner, measured from the point of nearest intersecting curbs or curb lines. No one may plant a street tree closer than 10 feet from any fire hydrant.

(F) Utilities. No one may plant street trees, other than those species listed as small trees, under or within 10 lateral feet of any overhead utility wire or over or within five lateral feet of any underground water line, sewer line, transmission line, or other utility.

(G) Public Tree Care. The City shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain, and remove trees, plants, and shrubs within the lines of all streets and public grounds as may be necessary to ensure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds and may require property owners to do the same.

(H) Removal of Trees. The City, through its City Forester, shall condemn and remove or order the removal of any tree, tree stump, shrub, or plant upon any public street or public property within this City where the same is dead, diseased, or deemed, for any reason, a nuisance or is not in compliance with adopted ordinances. The City, through its City Forester, shall have authority to condemn and remove, or order the removal of, any tree, tree stump, shrub, or plant upon private property when the City Forester finds such action necessary for public safety, to prevent the spread of disease or insects, or to prevent the upheaval of any public street, curb, or sidewalk. The City Forester shall have the authority, after exercising due diligence, to notify abutting property owners, to remove or order the removal of any tree, shrub, or plant upon any public right-of-way or on any public property in violation of this section or any other ordinance. The City Forester shall have the authority to report any violations of this section to the City Council for its action. Trees, shrubs, or plants removed under the provisions of this title shall be so removed at the property owner’s expense or at the expense of the abutting property owner if said plants are in the street right-of-way.

(I) Tree Topping. It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm, or City department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property. The definition of “topping” is the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree’s crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempt from this section at the determination of the City Tree Board.

(J) Pruning – Corner Clearance. Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the City shall prune the branches so that such branches shall not obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct the view of any street intersection and so that there shall be a minimum clear space of 11 feet above the surface of the street and a minimum clear space of seven feet above the surface of the sidewalk. Said owners shall remove all unhealthy, dead, diseased, or dangerous trees, or tree limbs that constitute a menace to the safety of the public or prevent the City from maintaining City sidewalks, curb, or streets. The City shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street from a street light or interferes with visibility of any traffic control device, traffic sign, or street maintenance equipment.

(K) Willful Injury to Trees. No person shall willfully injure or destroy any tree on public streets, public parks, or other public property of the City by any means including, but not limited to, the following:

[Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-11 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 2000, 1997; Code 1971 § 10-6-070.]


10.30.080 Buffer yards.

(A) Purpose. A buffer yard is a landscaped area between different land uses that is designed to reduce or eliminate nuisances such as dust, litter, noise, glare, unsightly areas, odor, and danger from fire or explosions.

(B) Location of Buffer Yards. Buffer yards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel adjacent to a different use and shall extend along the entire boundary of the property adjacent to that use. Fencing associated with buffer yards shall be located on property lines except as described in subsection (G) of this section.

(C) Determination and Approval of Buffer Yards Required. To determine the type of buffer yard required between two adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street, the following procedure shall apply:

(1) Identify the land use category of the existing land uses found in Table 1. The Planning Commission may determine the land use category if it is not clearly described in Table 1.

(2) Determine the buffer yard type required for the proposed development by using Table 2. The Planning Commission may determine the buffer type if it is not clearly described in Table 2.

(3) Using Table 3, identify the description of the required buffer type. The Planning Commission may make a recommendation to alter, include, or exclude elements within the applicable buffer type after evaluating the adjacent current and future land uses as designated by current zoning and/or the general plan. Any alteration to the standard buffer yard requirements shall be approved by the City Council.

(D) Use of Buffer Yards. The buffer yard may be used to provide for passive recreation and may contain pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails; provided, that:

(1) The buffer yard does not eliminate any plant material;

(2) Provisions are in place to ensure maintenance of the total width of the buffer yard; and

(3) All other requirements of this title are met. In no event, however, shall buffer yards contain the following uses: ice skating rinks, play fields, ski hills, stables, swimming pools, and tennis courts.

(E) Ownership of Buffer Yards. Buffer yards may remain in the ownership of the original developer of the land use or be subject to deed restrictions and subsequently freely conveyed, or the proprietor may transfer ownership to any consenting grantees, such as adjoining land owners or homeowners’ association, or deed the same to the City; provided, that any such conveyance adequately guarantees the protection of the buffer yard for the purposes of this title.

(F) General Landscaping Requirements. Buffer Types A through G identify details for landscaping requirements and specify the number and types of plants required in 50-foot increments.

(G) Alternative to Fencing Requirements. The fence and landscape buffer location may be switched if adjacent to a collector/arterial road or otherwise advantageous to reduce the potential for nuisance.

10.30.090 Agriculture protection areas.

(A) Purpose. An agriculture protection area is a geographic area created under the authority of the state of Utah and Syracuse City that is granted specific legal protection for agricultural production, which includes the production of crops, livestock, and livestock products or other agricultural production activities as determined by the Davis County agriculture protection area advisory board and the Syracuse City Planning Commission, acting as the Land Use Authority.

(B) Proposal to Create. An applicant proposing to create an agriculture protection area within Syracuse City boundaries shall submit to the Community Development Department an agriculture area request form and a submittal fee for processing. The City Council shall establish the submittal fee from time to time by resolution. The request shall identify the boundaries of the land proposed to become part of an agriculture protection area, any limits on the types of agriculture production that will be an allowed use within the agriculture protection area, and the names of the owners of record of the land and the tax parcel number identifying each parcel. Agriculture protection areas must have a minimum of 10 acres to be eligible for consideration of protection. The City Council shall provide notice of the proposal by publishing notice in a newspaper having general circulation within the community. The notice shall contain a statement that an applicant filed a proposal for the creation of an agriculture protection area with the City, the proposal is open for public inspection, and any entity affected by the proposal may file objections or modifications to the proposal.

(C) Review and Approval. After 15 days from the date of the notice, the City Council shall refer the proposal, with any objections and proposed modifications, to the county advisory board and the City Planning Commission for their review, comments, and recommendations. Within 45 days after receipt of the proposal, the county advisory board and City Planning Commission shall submit a written report to the City Council that recommends any modifications to the proposal, indicates whether or not the land is currently being used for agricultural production, states whether the zoning is appropriate for agriculture and whether the land is viable for agricultural production, the extent and nature of existing or proposed farm improvements, advisement of land use activities on adjoining property, and anticipated trends in agricultural and technological conditions. The Planning Commission will evaluate any objections to the proposal and make a recommendation to the City Council to accept, accept and modify, or reject the proposal. After receipt of the written reports from the advisory board and Planning Commission, or after 45 days, whichever is earlier, the City Council shall schedule a public hearing through notice in a newspaper having general circulation within the community. The City Council shall convene the public hearing at the time, date, and place specified in the notice and take verbal or written testimony from interested persons. Upon completion of the public hearing, the City Council shall approve, modify and approve, or reject the agriculture protection area proposal. [Ord. 11-02 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh.

(f) The spending of in-lieu fees shall be limited to the determined off-site receiving location and for no other civic or private use.

(g) If the City Council does not accept the request for in-lieu fees based off the qualifiers stated herein, the development shall build the on-site common space as required by the RPC zone.

(h) If a fee is accepted in lieu of common space, the project will nevertheless be required to build at a minimum: one on-site common amenity such as a tot lot, sport courts, and/or pool occupying at least five percent of the total project land area.

(i) The fee money will be due to the City prior to recording of the final subdivision plat proportionate to each phase as applicable.

(j) Development may be allowed on the land that has been accounted for through the collection of in-lieu fees at a density not to exceed the maximum units per acre prescribed by the zone.

(k) In-lieu fees shall be calculated on an individual basis. In-lieu fee amount shall be roughly equivalent to the value of forgone on-site common space area(s) and improvements.

(E) Front Yard. Twenty feet.

(F) Side Yards. A minimum of 10 feet between primary structures and five feet from the property line. If the height of the structure exceeds two stories, then the minimum side yard shall then be 16 feet between primary structures and eight feet from the property line.

(G) Rear Yard. A minimum of 15 feet.

(H) Building Height. As allowed by current adopted building code, with a maximum height of 35 feet to the top of the roof structure.

10.75.090 Land use approval process.

(A) Due to the unique nature of planned residential developments, an alternate approval process is hereby adopted. This process is adopted to ensure that the land use authority has a clear understanding of the nature of the proposed development prior to giving zone approval, and then expediting development after approval is given. It also calls for more detailed plans as the project develops, so that a property owner will have opportunities to receive input from the City Council on the project prior to investing in detailed plans.

(B) Requests for general plan map amendment, pursuant to SCC 10.20.060, shall be accompanied by the documents required for a subdivision concept plan, as provided in Chapter 8.20 SCC, for the entire development. These items shall be considered concurrently, with input provided by the Planning Commission and City Council to the property owner during the approval process. The City Council is the land use authority for this joint application, with the Planning Commission acting in a recommending capacity.

(C) Requests for an amendment to the zoning map, pursuant to SCC 10.20.070, shall be accompanied by the documents required for a preliminary subdivision review, as provided in Chapter 8.25 SCC, for the entire development. The application shall also be accompanied, to the extent Chapter 8.25 SCC does not require it, by:

(1) Master plan, including lot sizes and densities for each lot; 

(2) Circulation plan;

(3) Architectural theme plan; and

(4) Landscaping theme plan.

(D) The preliminary subdivision plat shall be considered concurrently with the zoning map amendment. The City Council is the land use authority for this joint application, with the Planning Commission acting in a recommending capacity. Once approved, the preliminary subdivision plat shall be considered a binding zoning document. The applicant must also execute a development agreement in connection to the zoning map amendment.

(E) Final subdivision approval for each phase of development for a master planned community shall proceed as provided in Chapter 8.30 SCC.

(F) The entirety of the proposed project must be presented and approved in one approval process. After the City Council grants preliminary approval of a development, no additional phases may be added.

(G) PRD zone entitlement is contingent upon the developer following the concurrently approved preliminary subdivision plat and the required development agreement. The development agreement shall run with the land and remain in force for the original developer. All subsequent owners of at least five percent of the land originally proposed to be developed shall be bound to the terms of the original agreement and plat until the conclusion of development. Failure of the developer to comply with the terms of the development agreement or preliminary subdivision plat may result in the Council reverting zoning back to the designation that existed prior to the zoning map amendment.

(A) Due to the unique nature of master planned community developments, an alternate approval process is hereby adopted. This process is adopted to ensure that the land use authority has a clear understanding of the nature of the proposed development prior to giving zone approval, and then expediting development after approval is given. It also calls for more detailed plans as the project develops, so that a property owner will have opportunities to receive input from the City Council on the project prior to investing in detailed plans.

(B) Requests for general plan map amendment, pursuant to SCC 10.20.060, shall be accompanied by the documents required for a subdivision concept plan, as provided in Chapter 8.20 SCC, for the entire development. These items shall be considered concurrently, with input provided by the Planning Commission and City Council to the property owner during the approval process. The City Council is the land use authority for this joint application, with the Planning Commission acting in a recommending capacity.

(C) Requests for an amendment to the zoning map, pursuant to SCC 10.20.070, shall be accompanied by the documents required for a preliminary subdivision review, as provided in Chapter 8.25 SCC, for the entire development. The application shall also be accompanied, to the extent Chapter 8.25 SCC does not require it, by:

(1) Master plan, including lot sizes and densities for each lot;

(2) Circulation plan;

(3) Architectural theme plan; and

(4) Landscaping theme plan.

(D) The preliminary subdivision plat shall be considered concurrently with the zoning map amendment. The City Council is the land use authority for this joint application, with the Planning Commission acting in a recommending capacity. Once approved, the preliminary subdivision plat shall be considered a binding zoning document. The applicant must also execute a development agreement in connection to the zoning map amendment.

(E) Final subdivision approval for each phase of development for a master planned community shall proceed as provided in Chapter 8.30 SCC.

(F) The entirety of the proposed project must be presented and approved in one approval process. After the City Council grants preliminary approval of a development, no additional phases may be added. 

(G) RPC zone entitlement is contingent upon the developer following the concurrently approved preliminary subdivision plat and the required development agreement. The development agreement shall run with the land and remain in force for the original developer. All subsequent owners of at least five percent of the land originally proposed to be developed shall be bound to the terms of the original agreement and plat until the conclusion of development. Failure of the developer to comply with the terms of the development agreement or preliminary subdivision plat may result in the Council reverting zoning back to the designation that existed prior to the zoning map amendment. [Ord. 18-21 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 16-27 § 1 (Exh. A).]

(1) One hundred percent residential projects are prohibited. 

(2) Apartment complex sales offices may not be the project’s sole commercial space. 

(3) The development agreement shall require that the commercial component of the project cannot be omitted and shall run with the land.

(4) The developer may partner with owners of off-site commercial projects to develop the required commercial square feet of the proposed project. This may be accomplished by building new buildings on empty pad spaces, attracting tenants that sign long-term leases in empty building space, enhancing circulation with cross access agreements, or assisting in the enhancement of the partner site in other mutually beneficial ways. City Council, with recommendation from Planning Commission, must find a direct benefit between the proposed residential units and the commercial project to exercise this option. This option is available at the developer’s request with the consent, desire, and agreement to partner from the owners of the existing commercial project. The agreed to enhancements to the partner site in this option must be completed before the first residential unit receives final occupancy. Details of the partnership obligations are to be included in the development agreement and shall be binding.

(a) The commercial component of the project may be split on and off site. The combined total commercial square footage provided shall be greater than or equal to the required square footage of commercial which is based upon the height of the proposed buildings. Distribution of on- and off-site commercial square footages shall be based on the assessment of unique site characteristics that lends itself to commercial viability and by the following:

(i) Properties within the town center overlay zone may build on- and off-site commercial in any combination, but no more than 70 percent of the required commercial may be located off site. The partner site must be located next door, sharing a property line with the proposed mixed use project.

(ii) Properties outside the town center overlay may build on- and off-site commercial in any combination. The partner site must be within one-quarter mile of the proposed mixed-use project.

(5) For a space to qualify as counting toward the required commercial square footage, it must not be accessory to the residential units, meaning to have separate utility connections, dedicated parking that is near the business entrance, a separate entrance, separate restroom, and appropriate fire separation between differing uses. Office, medical office, assisted living, retail space, or other uses deemed beneficial by City Council are to be considered commercial. Industrial uses like warehousing or storage units are not considered to be commercial uses. Also, parking areas, trash, outdoor dining, or other outdoor storage areas do not count towards the required commercial square footage.

(D) On-Site Amenities and Landscaping.

(1) Common Space Amenities. The project shall develop common space amenities proportionate to and in relation to the scale and resident demographics of the proposed project. Amenities shall be privately owned and managed by an HOA. Amenities must be chosen from the following list as required in the following table:

	Number of Units	Amenities Required

	0 – 20	1

	20 – 40	2

	40 – 60	3

	60 – 80	4

	80 – 100	5

	100 +	6

(5) Buffering between land uses as required in SCC 10.30.080. 

(6) In-Lieu Fee for Required Open Space or Amenity. An in-lieu fee may be accepted for the development of a nearby City park under the following conditions:

(a) The developer initiates a request to pay a fee in lieu of required common space by petitioning the City at the same time that the concept plan is under review.

(b) The proposed project shall be located within one-half mile (measured in a straight line) of an existing or future Syracuse City park as identified in the adopted parks master plan. Measurement shall be made from the nearest property line of the park to the nearest property line of the development project.

(i) The in-lieu fee shall not be approved if any portion of the proposed development is further than one mile from the nearest receiving park property boundary.

(ii) The park property to receive the fee money shall be identified and approved in conjunction with the concept plan.

(c) Qualification of an off-site location to receive in-lieu-of-common-space fees shall be approved by City Council based upon the development needs and priorities stated in the adopted parks master plan, and such qualification shall be decided at the time that the Council reviews the concept plan.

(d) The spending of in-lieu fees shall be limited to the determined off-site receiving location and for no other civic or private use.

(e) If the City Council does not accept the request for in-lieu fees based off the qualifiers stated herein, the development shall build the on-site common space as required by the MXD zone.

(h) Development may be allowed on the land that has been accounted for through the collection of in-lieu fees at a density not to exceed the maximum prescribed by the zone.

(i) In-lieu fees shall be calculated on an individual basis. In-lieu fee amount shall be roughly equivalent to the value of forgone on-site common space area(s) and improvements. Fees shall be determined using mutually accepted methods for cost estimating the dollar amount needed to build the equivalent park improvements and acquire the land needed for said park space. Credit for on-site common space developed beyond the minimum 15 percent identified in subsection (D)(6)(f) of this section, and actually built within the development, may be subtracted from the estimated fee due.

(j) The agreed-upon fee amount, percentage of provided on-site and off-site in-lieu fee, and park development cost per square foot shall be included in a development agreement.

(E) Site Design.

(1) Buildings shall be positioned on the site so that all first-floor front doors face the public road or private drive.

(B) Industrial Performance Standards. The following performance standards are intended to ensure that all industries will provide reasonable modern control methods to protect the City from hazards and nuisances; to set objective, quantitative standards for the maximum tolerated levels of frequently hazardous or annoying emissions; and to protect any industry from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based solely on the characteristics of that type of industry’s past uncontrolled operation.

(1) General.

(a) No land or building devoted to uses authorized by this chapter shall be used or occupied in any manner that violates subsection (B)(2) of this section.

(b) Traditional practices are allowed to support each specific type of business. This includes, but is not limited to, transportation, hours of operation, maintenance, etc.

(c) In addition to meeting other application requirements for site plan approval or a conditional use permit, parties seeking approval for a neighborhood services zone use shall include in the application a description of the proposed machinery, products, and processes to be located at the development. If, in its opinion, the proposed use may violate subsection (B)(2) of this section, the Planning Commission may refer the application for investigation and report to one or more expert consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to the applicable performance standards specified in subsection (B) of this section. Such consultant shall report as promptly as possible. A copy of such report shall be promptly furnished to the applicant. The cost of such expert report shall be borne by the applicant.

(d) Within 20 days after the Commission receives the aforesaid application or report, if a report was required, or within such period as agreed to by the applicant, the Commission shall determine whether reasonable measures are being employed to assure compliance with the applicable performance standards. On such basis, the Commission may approve or refuse to approve the use or may require a modification of the proposed plans, construction specifications, device or operation, and shall so inform the Building Official.

(e) Any approval so issued shall evidence only that reasonable measures are being taken. It shall not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of meeting such standards when the business is actually in operation; and, in case of a failure to perform in accordance with standards, whatever additional devices or modifications in process shall be necessary to achieve full compliance with the standards shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant.

(f) The Land Use Administrator shall investigate any purported violation of performance standards as set forth in subsection (B)(2) of this section; and, if necessary for such investigation, may request that the Planning Commission employ qualified experts. If, after public hearing and due notice, the Planning Commission finds that a violation has existed or does exist, it shall order the Land Use Administrator to serve notice that compliance with the performance standards must be achieved within a specified period of time or the business will be shut down. Should a violation of performance standards occur, the Planning Commission may order the offending plant to cease operation until proper steps are taken to correct the conditions causing the violation. The service of any qualified experts, employed by the Planning Commission to advise in establishing a violation, shall be paid by the violator if said violation is established, otherwise by the City.

(2) Performance Standards. The determination of the existence of any of the following elements shall be measured at the lot line of the establishment or use.

(a) Noise. No use shall emit or cause the emission of sound from a stationary source or ground transportation creating a ninetieth percentile sound pressure level (L90) for any measured period (not less than 60 minutes) that exceeds 70 dB(a) from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. or 55 dB(a) from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.

No emission of odorous gases or other odorous matter shall be permitted in such quantities as to be readily detectable when diluted in the ratio of one volume of odorous air to four volumes of clean air at the points of measurement specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section or at the point of greatest concentration. Any process which may involve the creation or emission of any odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard system, so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard system should fail.

(d) Glare. No direct or sky-reflected glare, whether from flood lights or from high temperature processes such as combustion or welding or otherwise, shall be permitted to be visible at the points of measurement specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section. This restriction shall not apply to signs or lighting of buildings or grounds for advertising or protection otherwise permitted by the provisions of this chapter.

(e) Fire and Explosion Hazards. All activities involving, and all storage of, flammable and explosive materials shall be provided at any point with adequate safety devices against the hazard of fire and explosion and adequate fire fighting and fire suppression equipment and devices as required by the Uniform Fire Code, Uniform Fire Code Standards, and Life Safety Code.

10.120.070 Special provisions.

(A) Landscaping. All lots, parcels, or sites shall have a minimum 10 percent of the total area landscaped, including all required front yards, and permanently maintained in good condition.

(B) Industrial Performance Standards. The following performance standards shall ensure that all industries will provide necessary modern control methods to protect the City from hazards and nuisances; set objective, quantitative standards for the maximum tolerated levels of frequently hazardous or annoying emissions; and protect any industry from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based solely on the characteristics of that type of industry’s past uncontrolled operation.

(1) General.

(a) No one shall use or occupy any land or building devoted to uses authorized by this chapter in any manner so as to create a dangerous, injurious, noxious, or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive, or other hazard; noise or vibration; smoke, dust, odor, or other form of air pollution; heat, cold, dampness, glare, electrical, or other disturbance; liquid or solid refuse or waste; or other substance, condition, or element in such a manner or in such an amount as to affect adversely the surrounding area or adjoining premises. The foregoing are hereinafter referred to as “dangerous or objectionable elements.”

(b) In addition to meeting other application requirements for site plan approval or a conditional use permit, parties seeking approval for an industrial use shall include in the application a description of the proposed machinery, products, and processes to be located at the development. The application shall include an investigation and report from a qualified consultant outlining all possible environmental impacts the industrial use may have. The cost of such expert report shall be borne by the applicant.

(c) Within 20 days after the Commission receives the aforesaid application and report, the Commission shall determine whether the plans would employ reasonable measures to assure compliance with the applicable performance standards. On such basis, the Commission may approve or refuse to approve the use or may require a modification of the proposed plans.

(2) Dangerous and Objectionable Elements.

(a) Noise. No use shall emit or cause the emission of sound from a stationary source such that the one-hour equivalent sound level (Leq) of resultant sound measurement, at the lot line of the establishment or use, exceeds, by six dB(a) or more, the one-hour equivalent sound level (Leq) caused by ground transportation as estimated for that point of measurement and that time of day, pursuant to FHWA-RD-77-108 Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model, or by other techniques at least as accurate. The sound level measuring instrumentation shall conform with ANSI S1.4-1971 Type 1 and compatible measurement procedures, according to ANSI S1.13-1971, with the following adjustments:

(i) Adjustment for Temporal and Tonal Characteristics of Sound. If the sound has a pronounced audible-tonal quality, such as a whine, screech, buzz, or hum, or an audible cyclic variation in sound level, such as beating or other amplitude modulation, the measured sound level shall increase by five dB to allow for more subjective response to the sound.

(ii) Quasi-Steady Impulsive Sound. Where the sound is of a repetitive impulse nature, providing a steady reading using the “slow response” setting on the sound level meter, the measured value shall increase by 10 dB to allow for more subjective response to the sound.

Only one of the subsections (B)(2)(A)(i) or (B)(2)(A)(ii) of this section may apply to qualify for an adjustment. In a case where both subsections apply, subsection (B)(2)(A)(ii) of this section takes precedence.

No use shall emit, cause, or permit the emission of sound of an impulsive nature from a stationary source such that it results in an impulsive sound level at a point of measurement in excess of 80 dB or, in a one-hour equivalent level (Leq), exceeding that one-hour equivalent level (Leq) caused by ground transportation as estimated for that point of measurement and that time of day, pursuant to FHWA-RD-77-108 or equivalent method.

(b) Vibration. No use shall create or permit a vibration (other than from transportation facilities or temporary construction work) that is discernible without instruments at the points of measurement specified in subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section.

(c) Odors. No use shall emit odorous gases or other odorous matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable when diluted in the ratio of one volume of odorous air to four volumes of clean air at the points of measurement specified in subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section or at the point of greatest concentration. Any process that may involve the creation or emission of any odors shall provide a secondary safeguard system in order to maintain control should the primary safeguard system fail.

(d) Glare. No use shall permit direct or sky-reflected glare that penetrates beyond the property upon which the light source is located, whether from flood lights or from high-temperature processes such as combustion or welding or otherwise, in a manner constituting a nuisance or hazard.

(e) Fire and Explosion Hazards. All activities and all storage of flammable and explosive materials shall include adequate safety, fire-fighting, and fire suppression equipment and devices standard in the industry to protect against the hazard of fire and explosion. No use shall permit the burning of waste materials in open fires at any point.

(f) Air Pollution. No use shall emit particulate or gaseous pollutants into the air in violation of the Utah State Air Conservation Act, its amendments, or resulting regulations.

(g) Liquid or Solid Wastes. No use shall discharge, at any point, into a public sewer, public waste disposal system, private sewage system, or stream, or into the ground contrary to the Utah State Water Pollution Control Act, its amendments, the subsequent Wastewater Disposal Regulations, or the Utah Code of Solid Waste Disposal Regulations.

(C) Enforcement. The Land Use Administrator shall investigate any purported violation of performance standards; and, if necessary for such investigation, may request the Planning Commission to employ qualified experts. If, after public hearing and due notice, the Planning Commission finds that a violation existed or does exist, it shall order the Land Use Administrator to serve notice that compliance with the performance standards must be achieved within a specified period of time or the plant will be closed. Should the violation of performance standards threaten the public health, convenience, or welfare, the Planning Commission may order the offending plant to cease operation until proper steps are taken to correct the conditions which cause the violation. The violator shall pay for services of any qualified experts, employed by the Planning Commission to advise in establishing a violation, upon establishment of said violation or the City shall pay otherwise. The determination of the existence of dangerous and objectionable elements shall be made at any point; provided, however, the measurements of the noise, vibration, odors, or glare are taken at the lot line of the establishment or use.

In addition to the City’s standard conditional use permit considerations, the City shall consider the following factors when deciding whether to grant a conditional use permit for a personal wireless services facility:

(A) Compatibility. The facility or antenna shall be compatible with the height, mass, and design of buildings, structures, neighborhood aesthetics, and uses in the vicinity of the facility.

(B) Screening. The facility or antenna shall use existing or proposed vegetation, topography, or structures in a manner that effectively screens the facility.

(C) Disguise. The facility or antenna shall include a disguise that mitigates potential negative impacts on surrounding properties.

(D) Parcel Size. The parcel upon which the facility or antenna will be located shall be of sufficient size to adequately support the facility.

(E) Location on Parcel. The structure or antenna shall be located on the parcel in a manner that can best protect the interests of surrounding property owners but still accommodate other appropriate uses of the parcel.

(F) Co-Location. The applicant shall be willing to allow co-location on its facility by other personal wireless services providers on such terms as are common in the industry. [Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; Ord. 03-08; Code 1971 § 10-23-090.]

Monopoles and towers shall be located at least 1,000 feet from each other except upon showing of necessity by the applicant, or upon a finding by the City that a closer distance would adequately protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community. This distance requirement shall apply to stealth facilities or to antennas attached to lawful structures such as transmission towers, utility poles, outdoor lighting structures, and water tanks.

(B) Location on Parcel. Monopoles shall be located as unobtrusively on a parcel as possible, given the location of existing structures, nearby residential areas, and service needs of the applicant. Monopoles shall not be located in a required landscaped area, buffer area, or parking area. [Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 2001; Code 1971 § 10-23-100.]

All operators of personal wireless services facilities shall demonstrate compliance with applicable Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, including FCC radio frequency regulations, at the time of application and periodically thereafter as requested by the City. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations shall be grounds for revoking a site plan or conditional use permit approval.

(B) Protection Against Climbing. Monopoles shall be protected against unauthorized climbing by removal of the climbing pegs from the lower 20 feet of the monopole.



(C) Fencing. Applicant shall fully enclose all monopoles and towers with a minimum six-foot-tall fence or wall, as directed by the City.

(D) Security Lighting Requirements. Monopoles and towers shall comply with the FAA requirements for lighting. As part of the conditional use permit consideration, the City may also require security lighting for the site. If using security lighting, the applicant shall minimize the lighting impact on surrounding residential areas by using indirect lighting, where appropriate. [Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 2001; Code 1971 § 10-23-110.]

(A) Notice. Notice to remove shall be given in writing by personal service or by certified mail addressed to the last known applicant.

(B) Violation. Failure to remove the antennas and monopoles as instructed after receiving written notice to remove the same is a violation of the terms of this chapter. The City may initiate criminal and/or civil legal proceedings against any person, firm, or corporation, whether acting as principal, agent, property owner, lessee, lessor, tenant, landlord, employee, employer, or otherwise, for failure to remove antennas and monopoles in accordance with this chapter. Any lease agreement with the City shall also stipulate that failure to remove the antennas and monopoles after receiving written notice to do so pursuant to this chapter automatically transfers ownership of the antennas, monopoles, support buildings, and all other structures on the site to the City. [Ord. 08-07 § 1 (Exh. A); Ord. 06-27; Ord. 06-17; amended 2001; Code 1971 § 10-23-120.]

When a new structure is necessary to house such equipment, the structure shall blend with the natural features, buildings, and structures in the zone wherein the facility will be located.

(3) Accessory Buildings. Freestanding accessory buildings used with a personal wireless services facility shall not exceed 450 square feet and shall comply with the setback requirements for structures in the zone wherein the facility will be located.

(B) Parking. The City may require a minimum of one parking stall for sites containing a monopole, tower, and/or accessory buildings, if there is insufficient parking available on the site.

(C) Landscaping. Applicants shall landscape all sites with personal wireless services facilities per conditions of approval by the City Planning Commission.

The City Council shall thereafter render its decision on the appeal no later than 30 days after the challenge to the impact fee is filed.

(C) Within 90 days of a decision regarding an impact fee by the City Council, any party to the appeal that is adversely affected by the City Council’s decision may petition the District Court for review of the decision. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-8.]


13.55.090 Collection of impact fees.

Impact fees for all new development activity shall be collected in conjunction with the application for a building permit. [Ord. 14-19; Ord. 13-18 § 1; Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-9.]


13.55.100 Fund accounting for impact fees.

(A) The City Council shall establish a separate interest-bearing accounting fund for each type of planned facility for which an impact fee is collected. The City shall invest such fees and the yield on such fees, at the actual rate of return to the City, shall be credited to such accounting fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies of the City, subject to a deduction by the City of a reasonable cash management fee. Such funds need not be segregated from other City moneys for banking purposes. Interfund loans may be made between such accounting funds.

(B) Any yield on such accounting fund into which the fees are deposited shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes specified for such fund.

(C) The City shall maintain and keep financial records for each such accounting fund showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned and received by the fund, and each expenditure from such fund, in accordance with normal City accounting practices, and at the end of each fiscal year shall prepare a report on each such fund showing such information. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the same manner as other financial records of the City.

(D) Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within six years after their receipt, unless the Council identifies, in writing, an extraordinary and compelling reason to hold the impact fees longer than six years. Under such circumstances, the Council shall establish an absolute date by which the impact fees shall be expended. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-10.]


13.55.110 Refunds.

(A) If the City fails to expend or encumber the impact fees as required by SCC 13.55.100(D), all current owners of the property on which impact fees have been paid shall receive a pro rata refund of such impact fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis.

(B) The City shall notify the owner or owners of property for which such a refund may be made, by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service, at the last known address of such property owners.

(C) In order to receive such a refund, the owner or owners of the subject property must, within 12 months after the mailing of such notice by the City, make a written request for a refund to the City Council, including a certification that such person is a record owner of the property and that he or she is entitled to the refund. The City Council may rely on such certification, in the absence of a written certification by another person asserting that the proposed payee is not the proper payee. If in doubt as to whom to pay such funds, the City may deposit the funds with an appropriate court for disposition as the court may determine. In that event, the City may deduct from the funds deposited an amount equal to the reasonable costs, including attorneys’ fees, of causing the funds to be deposited with the court.

(D) Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within such one-year period shall be retained by the City and expended on appropriate planned facilities.

(E) Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned.

(F) When the City Council seeks to terminate any or all components of the impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered impact fees from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. The City Council shall publish notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all owners of property for which a refund may be made by first class mail at the last known address of such property owners. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of 12 months following the second publication. At the end of that period, any remaining funds shall be retained by the City, but must be expended for appropriate planned facilities. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the impact fee account(s) being terminated.

(G) The City shall refund to a developer any impact fees paid by that developer, plus interest earned on the impact fees, if:

(1) The developer does not proceed with the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed;

(2) The developer files with the City Council a written request for the refund not later than 30 calendar days after the expiration of the building permit (or any extension thereof) in connection with which the impact fees were assessed; and

(3) The City Council determines that no impact has resulted from the contemplated development activity.

(H) The City shall charge an administrative fee for verifying and computing the refund equal to the lesser of three percent of the amount of the refund or the City’s actual cost of such verification and computing. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-11.]


13.55.120 Use of funds.

(A) Impact fees shall be used solely for the purposes for which they were received.

(B) Impact fees shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in existing facilities serving existing developments.

(C) Impact fees shall not be used for maintenance or operation.

(D) Impact fees may be spent for planned facilities, including but not limited to planning, land acquisition, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, mitigation costs, capital equipment pertaining to planned facilities, and any other similar expenses that can be capitalized pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.

(E) Impact fees may also be used to recoup improvement costs previously incurred by the City to the extent that new growth and development activity will be served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs.

(F) Impact fees may be used to recoup the cost of studying, analyzing, and preparing the impact fees.

(G) Impact fees may be used to pay debt service on bonds or similar debt instruments issued to finance planned facilities to the extent such planned facilities serve the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-12.]


13.55.130 Impact fee as supplemental regulation to other financing methods.

Except as otherwise provided herein, impact fees are in addition to any other requirements, taxes, fees, or assessments imposed by the City on development activity or the issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. Impact fees are intended to be consistent with the City’s general plan, capital facilities plan, land development ordinances, and other City policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the City seeks to ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development activity.

In addition to the use of impact fees, the City may finance qualifying capital improvements through the issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-13.]


13.55.140 Adjustments.

(A) The City Council is authorized, upon a proper showing, to adjust the standard impact fee at the time the fee is charged:

(1) To respond to unusual circumstances in specific cases, where, if no adjustments were made, an inequitable collection of impact fees would result;

(2) To ensure that the impact fee is imposed fairly and in such a manner that people in similar situations paid a substantially similar impact fee;

(3) Based upon studies and data submitted by the developer that justify recalculating the amount of the impact fee on a particular lot or development; or

(4) To allow credits as approved by the City Council for dedication of land for, improvement to, or new construction of system improvements provided by the developer, if the facilities are identified in the capital facilities plan and are required by the City as a condition of approving the development activity.

(B) As used herein, “system improvements” means:

(1) Existing public facilities that are designed to provide services to service areas within the community at large; and

(2) Future public facilities identified in a capital facilities plan that are intended to provide service to service areas within the community at large. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-14.]


13.55.150 Independent impact fee calculations.

(A) If a fee payer desires not to have an impact fee determined according to an impact fee enactment set forth in the appendices to this chapter, on file in the office of the City Recorder, then the fee payer shall prepare and submit to the City Council an independent impact fee calculation for the development activity. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent impact fee calculation was made. The appropriate department staff persons shall review the independent impact fee calculation and provide an analysis to the City Council concerning whether the independent impact fee calculation should be accepted, rejected, or accepted in part. The City Council may adopt, reject, or adopt in part the independent impact fee calculation based on the department’s analysis and based on the specific characteristics of the development activity. The impact fee or alternative impact fee and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer.

(B) Any fee payer submitting an independent impact fee calculation must pay to the City a fee to cover the cost of reviewing the independent impact fee calculation. The fee shall be an amount equal to the actual review costs incurred by the City, including the cost of any consultant services deemed necessary by the City Council. The City shall require the fee payer to post a cash deposit of $150.00 prior to initiating the review, subject to refunding to the fee payer any portion of such deposit that exceeds actual costs of review.

(C) The City Council shall consider the documentation submitted by the fee payer and the analysis prepared by the appropriate department staff persons, but is not required to accept such documentation or analysis. The City Council may require the fee payer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The City Council may adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent impact fee calculation and the specific characteristics of the development activity. The impact fees or alternative impact fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-15.]


13.55.160 Penalty.

A violation of this chapter is a Class B misdemeanor. Upon conviction, the violator shall be punishable according to law; however, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the City Council shall have the power to sue in civil court to enforce the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 02-01; Code 1971 § 3-11-16.]
