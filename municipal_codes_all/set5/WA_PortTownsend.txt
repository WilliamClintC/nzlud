Article I. General Provisions


1.20.001 Policy.

It is the general policy of the city of Port Townsend to emphasize code compliance by education and prevention as a first step. This policy is designed to ensure code compliance and timely action that is available to all persons and is uniform in its implementation. While warnings and voluntary compliance are desirable as a first step, enforcement and civil penalties should be used, consistent with the criteria set forth below, for remedial purposes as needed to assure and effect code compliance. Abatement or remediation, including restoration of a situation to pre-activity condition, is a primary goal in all cases and pursued when appropriate and feasible.

Abatement or remediation occurs where an owner subsequently brings the activity into code compliance by obtaining required permits and completing work consistent with the permits (however, the owner is still subject to other judicial or administrative remedies, including penalties). There are situations where restoration of a situation to pre-activity condition will not be feasible, for example, damage to or destruction of an older, larger, significant tree. In such situations, remediation based on reasonable replacement criteria would apply (and the owner is still subject to other judicial or administrative remedies, including penalties). 

Uniform and efficient procedures, with consistent application tailored by regulation, should be used to accomplish this policy. 

Without having attempted to secure voluntary compliance, or where voluntary compliance occurs after a violation, the director shall consider issuing a notice and order with civil penalties and/or a civil infraction with civil penalties under the following circumstances:

A. When an emergency exists; or

B. When a repeat violation occurs (whether or not the same or a similar violation, and whether or not the violation occurred on the project or site in question or occurred on another project or site); or

C. When the director finds the violation to be flagrant or severe; or where the actions have compromised the city’s ability to make reasonable determinations concerning the violation; or

D. When the violation creates a situation or condition that cannot be corrected; or

E. When the person knows or reasonably should have known that the action is in violation of a city regulation. A currently or previously licensed professional, for example, contractor or subcontractor, or person currently or previously involved in the building trades, is presumed to have known that an action is in violation of a city regulation; or

F. The person cannot be contacted or refuses to communicate or cooperate with the city in promptly correcting the violation; or

No provision of this chapter is intended to impose any duty upon the city or any of its officers or employees, which would subject them to damage in a civil action. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.010 Authorization.

The directors are authorized to use procedures of this chapter in order to enforce against violations of any land use or other ordinance within their administrative jurisdiction. Such procedures are not exclusive but are supplemental to the civil and/or criminal enforcement provisions of applicable state or federal law. Further, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the building official or fire chief from following the enforcement process and provisions of the International Building Code, the International Fire Code, or any other standardized code duly adopted by the city. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.020 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the words and phrases designated in this section shall be defined as follows:

A. “Director” or “directors” means the department directors with authority to administer code within their respective departments, including director(s) of the department of development services, the department of public works, finance director, and police chief, and shall also include any duly authorized representative of such director(s).

B. If such building, structure, property or portion thereof is occupied, the inspector shall present identification credentials, state the reasons for the inspection and request entry.

C. If such building, structure, property or portion thereof is unoccupied, the inspector shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the building, structure, property or portion thereof and request entry. If the inspector is unable to locate the owner or such other persons, or he or she has reason to believe that conditions therein create an immediate and irreparable land use or safety hazard, he or she shall make entry.

D. It is unlawful for any owner or occupant or any other person having charge, care or control of any building, structure, property or portion thereof to fail or neglect after proper request has been given to permit prompt entry where the inspector has reason to believe that conditions therein create an immediate and irreparable land use or safety hazard.

E. Unless entry is consented to by the owner or person in control of any building, structure, property or portion thereof or conditions are believed to exist which create an immediate and irreparable land use or safety hazard, the inspector, prior to entry, shall obtain a search warrant as authorized by applicable law.

F. Any person submitting an application for any land use permit shall be deemed to have consented to on-site inspection of their property for the purpose of assessing compliance with city land use ordinances. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.040 Abatement, remediation, and restoration proceedings – Authorized.

A. In addition to or as an alternative to any other judicial or administrative remedy provided in this chapter or by law or other ordinance, a director is authorized to and should order a land use or other ordinance violation to be abated, remediated and/or corrected or restored. A director is authorized to and should order any person who creates or maintains a violation to commence corrective work and to complete the work within such time as the director determines reasonable under the circumstances. If the required corrective work is not commenced or completed within the time specified, the director is authorized to and should proceed to abate the violation and cause the work to be done.

In cases involving a violation of the city’s critical areas regulations (Chapter 19.05 PTMC) or shoreline management plan (adopted by Ordinance 2938), including any amendments, a director shall order a violation to be abated, remediated and/or corrected or restored. In cases involving a violation of the city’s critical areas regulations (Chapter 19.05 PTMC) or shoreline management plan (adopted by Ordinance 2938), including any amendments, a director is authorized to and shall order any person who creates or maintains a violation to commence corrective work and to complete the work within such time as the director determines reasonable under the circumstances. In cases involving a violation of the city’s critical areas regulations (Chapter 19.05 PTMC) or shoreline management plan (adopted by Ordinance 2938), including any amendments, if the required corrective work is not commenced or completed within the time specified, the director is authorized to and shall proceed to abate the violation and cause the work to be done.

B. Whenever any condition on or use of property causes or constitutes or reasonably appears to cause or constitute an imminent or immediate danger to the health or safety of the public or a significant portion thereof, or to the environment, the director shall have the authority to summarily and without prior notice abate the same. Notice of such abatement shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.

C. The city may seek a judicial abatement order from the Jefferson County superior court to abate a condition which continues to be a violation where other methods of remedial action have failed to produce compliance. 

D. In any abatement action, the city shall be entitled to recover the costs and expenses of such abatement, including those costs specified in PTMC 1.20.075. The obligation constitutes a lien against the property, and is both a joint and/or separate obligation of the owner and/or any person who is in violation. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.050 Provisions not exclusive – Additional relief.

The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive, and may be used cumulatively and in addition to other enforcement provisions authorized by the Port Townsend Municipal Code except as precluded by law. 

The payment of a civil penalty pursuant to this chapter does not relieve a person of the duty to correct or remediate the violation as ordered by a director.

Notwithstanding the existence or use of any other remedy, a director may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices or abate any conditions which constitute or will constitute a violation of any land use or other ordinance or rules and regulations adopted under such ordinance when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.055 Separate violations.

Each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation is committed, continued, allowed or not corrected shall be deemed a violation for purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.060 Criminal penalty.

As an alternative to and in addition to any other judicial or administrative remedy provided in this chapter, any person who willfully or knowingly violates or fails to comply with any stop work order or emergency order, issued by a director pursuant to this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day such violation or failure to comply continues shall be considered an additional misdemeanor offense. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.065 Civil infraction.

As an alternative to and in addition to any other judicial or administrative remedy provided in this chapter, the applicable department director may issue a notice of civil infraction pursuant to Chapter 7.80 RCW. Civil infractions are not crimes. The provisions of Chapter 7.80 RCW, including any amendments thereto, are adopted by reference as and for a portion of the code of the city as if set forth in full. “Enforcement officer” in Chapter 7.80 RCW is the director defined in this chapter, and also includes the chief of police (and shall also include any duly authorized representative of such director or chief of police). (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.075 Penalties – Civil assessment schedule – Expenses and costs – Double permit fees.

A. Civil penalty: $250.00 for each day of violation.

B. Criminal penalty: $1,000 and/or 180 days in jail. See PTMC 1.20.060.

C. Expenses and Costs. Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall, in addition to the remedies, sanctions and penalties provided herein, be liable for and shall promptly reimburse the city for any and all expenses incurred by the city in attempting to obtain the violator’s compliance with applicable city regulations. Said expenses include, but are not limited to, administrative staff time, photocopying charges and vehicle mileage, expert, consultant, or contractor fees, equipment rental charges, attorneys’ fees, photocopying charges, legal costs, recording fees, filing fees, mailing and postage charges, and vehicle mileage. All city costs and expenses shall include a 20 percent city overhead fee. 

1. Reimbursement rates for administrative staff time, photocopying charges and vehicle mileage shall be as established by internal city policy based on the staff person’s salary plus benefits, plus 20 percent city overhead fee. 

2. Reimbursement rates for postage charges, recording fees and filing expenses shall be at actual cost, plus 20 percent city overhead fee. 

3. Reimbursement rates for equipment rental and for any expert, consultant or contractor, or attorney retained by the city to assist in compliance monitoring, site analysis, abatement or other enforcement-related function shall be at the rate actually charged to the city therefor, plus 20 percent city overhead fee.

D. Double Permit Fees – Work Commencing Before Permit Issuance. Any person who commences work where a permit is required under a land use or other ordinance before obtaining the necessary permit(s) shall be subject to payment of double the required permit fee. The director may waive payment of the double permit fees if the director determines the factors set forth in PTMC 1.20.001 do not apply.

E. Additional Penalty. In addition to the civil assessments and penalties set forth in this section, violations may also be assessed penalties at an amount reasonably determined by a director to be equivalent to:

1. The economic benefit that the violator derives from the violation, as measured by the greater of the resulting increase in market value of the property or the value received by the violator; and/or 

2. Savings of construction costs realized by the violator; and/or

3. Reasonable value of property damaged.

F. Enhanced Penalty. In addition to other penalties and civil assessments set forth in this section, additional daily penalties, according to the following schedule, may be added where there is:

	(A) Public health or safety risk; emergency	Plus $500.00 – $2,500 depending on severity

	(B) Environmental damage (1)	Plus $500.00 – $2,500 depending on severity

	(C) Damage to property	Plus $500.00 – $2,500 depending on severity

	(D) History of similar violations (less than three)	Plus $1,000

	(E) History of similar violations (three or more)	Plus $2,500

	(F) Economic benefit to person responsible for violation	Plus $1,000

	(G) Flagrant or severe violation	Plus $500.00 – $2,500 depending on severity

	(H) When the violation causes a situation or condition that cannot be corrected	Plus $500.00 – $2,500 depending on severity

	The above penalties may be offset by the following credits for efforts to comply:

	(A) Entering into a voluntary compliance agreement	25% of enhanced penalty 

	(B) Full compliance with voluntary compliance agreement and no history of prior violations	Plus 50% of enhanced penalty [Total of (A) and (B) equals 75% of enhanced penalty] 

	(C) Full compliance with voluntary compliance agreement and a history of prior violations	Plus 25% of enhanced penalty [Total of (A) and (C) equals 50% of enhanced penalty] 

	The enhanced penalties are further cumulative; for example, a violation which constitutes (B) environmental damages and (E) history of similar violations may have added additional daily penalties under both categories. 

	(1) Environmental damage means a violation of the city’s critical areas regulations (Chapter 19.05 PTMC) or shoreline management plan (adopted by Ordinance 2938), including any amendments; and damage to vegetation within city rights-of-way and property.

G. Other.

1. Imposition or payment of a civil penalty pursuant to this chapter does not relieve a person of the duty to correct or remediate the violation as ordered by a director. See PTMC 1.20.040, Abatement, remediation, and restoration proceedings – Authorized.

2. In addition to any other penalty under this section, a director is authorized to suspend or revoke any permits issued pursuant to any land use ordinance as further set forth in this chapter. 

3. A civil assessment or penalty may be imposed and constitutes a separate penalty for each day or portion of a day during which a violation occurs or exists. Civil penalties for violation of any formal notice and order to correct the violation, stop work order, emergency order or any other order issued by a director pursuant to this chapter (except an order to secure voluntary correction) shall begin to accrue on the first day the order is served and shall cease on the day the violation is actually stopped or the correction is completed, or arrangements are made for completion that are satisfactory to the director (for example, if correction includes plantings, but planting should not occur until later due to season). 

H. Monetary Penalty – Significant Trees. The monetary penalty for damaging, cutting or removing significant trees as defined in PTMC 12.04.150 shall be the greater of:

1. Five hundred dollars for each tree damaged, cut or removed; or 

2. The value of each tree damaged, cut or removed, with the value to be determined under methods described in the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers’ “Guide for Plant Appraisal,” published by the International Society of Arboriculture, as now or hereafter amended, using the value method (replacement value method, trunk-formula method, or other recognized method) that in the opinion of the public works director represents a fair and appropriate valuation. 

The monetary penalty is in addition to other penalties and assessments set forth in this section. (Ord. 2988 § 2, 2008; Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.080 Stop work order.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, whenever a continuing violation of any land use or other ordinance will materially impair a director’s ability to secure compliance with the ordinance, when the continuing violation threatens the health or safety of the public, or when the continuing violation threatens or harms the environment, the director shall issue a stop work order specifying the violation and prohibiting any work or other activity at the site related to the violation. If other work at the site can continue without interfering with the director’s ability to secure compliance and avoid threat to the health or safety of the public or threat or harm to the environment, the director need not stop work of the entire site where work is occurring in accordance with city codes and regulations.

The order should be posted on the subject property or served on persons engaged in any work in violation of this chapter, and a copy provided to the owner. The effect of such order shall be to require the immediate cessation of such work or activity, unless and until authorized by the director to proceed. In the event the director issues a stop work order, the voluntary correction procedures of PTMC 1.20.110 and the formal notice and order provisions of PTMC 1.20.120 shall not apply. A failure to comply with a stop work order shall constitute a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.090 Emergency order.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, whenever any use or activity in violation of any land use or other ordinance threatens the health and safety of the occupants of the premises or property, any member of the public or the environment, a director shall issue an emergency order directing that the use or activity be discontinued and the condition causing the threat to the public health and safety or threat and harm to the environment be corrected. The emergency order shall specify the time for compliance and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property, if posting is physically possible. In the event the director issues an emergency order, the voluntary correction procedures of PTMC 1.20.110 and the formal notice and order provisions of PTMC 1.20.120 shall not apply. A failure to comply with an emergency order shall constitute a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.100 Public nuisance declared.

Pursuant to the authority granted in RCW 35.23.331 and 35.23.440(10) as well as any other applicable statutory or constitutional provision, all violations of land use or other ordinances or any failure to comply with a notice and order, stop work order or emergency order issued pursuant to this chapter are determined to be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare and are declared public nuisances. All conditions which are determined by a director to be in violation of any land use or other ordinance shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter and shall be corrected by any reasonable and lawful means, as provided in this chapter. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.105 Complaint log.

Each department director responsible to administer the code shall create a log of code violations within his or her administration, with the following information: name; location; violation (or alleged violation); responsible department; outcome; staff comment or explanation of outcome; and source of complaint. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).

A. Issuance. Whenever a director determines that a violation has occurred or is occurring, such director may, if he or she deems it appropriate under the circumstances, and after considering the factors in PTMC 1.20.001, pursue reasonable attempts to secure voluntary correction, failing which he/she may order correction and pursue civil penalties pursuant to PTMC 1.20.120.

1.20.117 Service – Notices and orders, stop work orders.

A. Service of a notice of violation or notice and order shall be made on a person responsible for code violation by one or more of the following methods:

1. Personal service of a notice of violation or notice and order may be made on the person identified by the city as being responsible for the code violation, or by leaving a copy of the notice of violation or notice and order at the person’s house of usual abode with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides there;

The taxpayer’s address as shown on the tax records of Jefferson County shall be deemed to be the proper address for the purpose of mailing such notice to the landowner of the property where the violation occurred. Service by mail shall be presumed effective upon the third business day following the day upon which the notice of violation or notice and order was placed in the mail.

B. For notice and orders only, when the address of the person responsible for the code violation cannot be reasonably determined, service may be made by publication once in the city’s newspaper of record. Service by publication shall conform to the requirements of Civil Rule 4 of the Rules for Superior Court.

C. Service of a stop work order on a person responsible for a code violation may be made by posting the stop work order in a conspicuous place on the property where the violation occurred or by serving the stop work order in any other manner permitted by this chapter.

D. The failure of the city to make or attempt service on any person named in the notice of violation, notice and order or stop work order shall not invalidate any proceedings as to any other person duly served. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.120 Notice and order – Issuance.

A. Whenever the voluntary correction process set forth in PTMC 1.20.110 is unsuccessful, or a director believes that the violation will be most promptly and equitably terminated by an immediate administrative notice and order proceeding (also referred to as a “formal notice and order”), he or she shall issue a written notice and order directed either to the owner or operator of the source of the violation, the person in possession of the property where the violation originates or the person otherwise causing or responsible for the violation.

1.20.127 Obligations of persons responsible for code violation.

It shall be the responsibility of any person responsible for the code violation to bring the property into a condition that achieves code compliance as determined by the director. Payment of fines, applications for permits, acknowledgment of stop work orders, and compliance with other remedies does not substitute for performing the corrective work required and having the property brought into compliance as determined by the director.

Persons determined to be responsible for the code violation pursuant to a notice of infraction, notice and order, or stop work order shall be liable for the payment of any civil fines, penalties, and abatement costs.

If a property owner demonstrates that the action that resulted in the violation was taken without the owner’s knowledge or consent or by someone other than the owner or someone acting on the owner’s behalf, then that owner shall be responsible only for bringing the property into compliance to the extent feasible under the circumstances, and no civil fines or penalties shall be assessed against such an owner or his or her property interest for the code violation except as follows: the owner is responsible, in addition to costs of abatement and related expenses and costs, for civil penalties for the owner’s failure, following notice and order to abate, to bring the property into compliance as determined by the director. (Ord. 2988 § 3, 2008).


1.20.130 Appeal to hearing examiner.

A. Appeal. A person to whom a formal notice and order or an abatement order is directed may appeal such order by filing a written notice of appeal with the applicable department within 14 calendar days from the date of the notice and order to the hearing examiner pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1.14 PTMC.

B. Fee. The appeal shall be accompanied by an appeal fee in an amount set forth in PTMC 20.09.010.

C. Stay. Any per-day civil penalty shall not accrue during the pendency of such administrative appeal unless the hearing examiner determines that the appeal is frivolous or intended solely to cause delay. Enforcement of any formal notice and order or abatement order of a director issued pursuant to this chapter shall be stayed during the pendency of any appeal under this chapter, except when the director issues an emergency order and/or stop work order pursuant to PTMC 1.20.080 and 1.20.090.

D. Waiver. Failure to file a timely and complete appeal will constitute a waiver of all rights to an administrative appeal under city code.

E. Administrative Conference – Supplemental Notice and Order. At any time prior to the convening of an appeal hearing of a formal notice and order issued pursuant to PTMC 1.20.120, an informal administrative conference may be conducted by a director for the purposes of bringing communications between concerned parties and providing a forum for efficient resolution of any violation. A director may call a conference on his or her own initiative or in response to a request from the appellant. As a result of information developed at the conference, the director may affirm, modify or revoke the order. If the order is to be modified, a supplemental notice and order shall be issued which shall be subject to the same procedures applicable to all notices and orders contained in this chapter. The administrative conference is optional with a director, and is not a prerequisite to utilization of any of the enforcement provisions described in this chapter. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.140 Final order – Enforcement.

If, after any order duly issued by a director has become final, the person to whom such order is directed fails, neglects or refuses to obey such order, including refusal to pay a civil penalty assessed under such order, the director may:

Any permit or license issued by the city which was not in conformity with provisions of the ordinance then in effect is null and void. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.150 Suspension – Cause.

A. A director may temporarily suspend any permit issued under a land use or other ordinance, and if in the director’s judgment is necessary to secure compliance and does not interfere with a permit required to be issued as a matter of right, and withhold the issuance of additional permits in connection with the property or related to the project which gave rise to the suspension, for:

1. Failure of the holder to comply with the requirements of any land use or other ordinance, or rules or regulations adopted thereunder; or

2. Failure to comply with any order issued pursuant to this chapter; or

Upon correction and compliance as determined by the director, and payment of reinstatement fees, the suspension or withholding of permit(s) would terminate.

B. Such permit suspension shall be carried out through the notice and order provisions of this chapter and shall be effective upon service of the notice and order upon the holder or operator. The holder or operator may appeal the suspension as provided by PTMC 1.20.130.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, whenever a director finds that a violation of any land use or other ordinance, or rules and regulations adopted thereunder, has created immediate and irreparable hazard, he or she may, without service of a written notice and order, immediately suspend and terminate operations under the permit. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).


1.20.160 Revocation – Cause.

A. A director may permanently revoke any permit issued by such director for:

1. Failure of the holder to comply with the requirements of any land use or other ordinance, or rules or regulations promulgated thereunder; or

2. Failure of the holder to comply with any order issued pursuant to this chapter; or

3. Interference with a director in the performance of his/her duties; or

4. Discovery by a director that a permit was issued in error or on the basis of materially incorrect information supplied to the city;

5. Permit fees, costs, penalties were paid to the city by check and returned from a financial institution marked insufficient funds or cancelled, or are otherwise unpaid and due and owing.

In addition, for any of the reasons listed above, the finance director may revoke the business license of a person. 

In the event of a license suspension under this chapter, the applicant or license holder shall be responsible to pay administrative reinstatement fees of $100.00 prior to reinstatement of the business license and/or issuance of a new license to the business (or successor business) of the person responsible for the code violation.

B. Such permit revocation shall be carried out through the notice and order provisions of this chapter and shall be effective upon service of the notice and order upon the holder or operator. The holder or operator may appeal such revocation as provided by PTMC 1.20.130.

C. A permit may be suspended pending its revocation or a related hearing. (Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008).

The committee shall submit a written recommendation to the Port Townsend city council within 45 days of receiving the proposal from the city council.

2.76.010 Records available for public inspection – Exemptions.

All public records shall be available for public inspection and copying as provided for, and subject to, the exemptions contained in Chapter 42.56 RCW (the “Public Records Act”). (Ord. 3180 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3169 § 14 (Exh. J), 2017).

2.76.050 Public records index.

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4)(a), the city of Port Townsend is not required to maintain an all-inclusive index of public records based on the following findings:

A. The Revised Code of Washington (RCW) requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of all public records.

B. The RCW also states that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, or interfere with agency operation, a city must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

C. When such an order is made, all indexes maintained by the city must be made available to provide identifying information on those records which are available for inspection and/or copying.

D. The city of Port Townsend is comprised of multiple departments, their divisions and subdivisions, which maintain separate databases and/or record-keeping systems for the indexing of records and information.

E. Because the city has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems and databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a central index of records.

F. The city will fully comply with the provisions of the RCW as they relate to the Public Disclosure Act, under Chapter 42.56 RCW. (Ord. 3180 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3169 § 14 (Exh. J), 2017).

The authority shall commence its existence effective upon issuance of its charter and appointment and confirmation of the initial board of directors as provided in the charter.

The council, if it does not appoint a member recommended by the committee, shall ask the committee for new recommendations.

Except as otherwise provided herein, all members of the board shall continue to serve on the board until a successor is appointed and confirmed.

3.36.011 System development charge, building fees, and utility connection charges – Deferrals for low-income housing.

A. Program Established. The city shall allow deferral of payment of system development charges (SDCs), building fees, and utility connection charges for a private or public nonprofit organization that is developing or constructing housing units for low-income households, as defined in this section. The city manager or designee is authorized and directed to administer the program and in such connection may promulgate forms and administrative regulations from time to time to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter.

B. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to the administration of this section:

1. “Low-income household” means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is at or below 80 percent of the median family income adjusted for family size, for the county where the project is located, as reported by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

2. “Private or public nonprofit organizations” means nonprofit corporations, municipal corporations, and other organizations formally established for the charitable purpose of providing low-income or affordable housing, recognized under the United States Internal Revenue Code as qualified recipients of tax deductible charitable contributions, including but not limited to organizations having received approval from the Internal Revenue Service of such status upon the filing of all forms as required for recognition as a 501(c)(3) corporation. For an entity to qualify as a private or public nonprofit organization under the provisions of this section, upon making a written request for deferral, the entity shall provide sufficient proof of such status, including such documentation as the city manager may deem necessary. For purposes of this section, municipal public housing authorities established pursuant to Washington law shall be considered public nonprofit organizations.

3. “Building fee” means the building permit base fee, including related inspections, plan review, demolition, mechanical, plumbing, energy, addressing and street development permits.

“Building fee” does not mean or include state building permit fee, fire code fees (including fire alarm/fire sprinkler fees), land use fees (including, but not limited to, related to permits or approvals for platting, environmental, shoreline, critical area, conditional use or variance, design review, or requests for waiver), technology or record retention fees.

4. “Utility connection charges” means charges to connect to the water or sewer utility.

C. SDC, Building Fees, and Utility Connection Charge Deferral Requests – Qualified Applicants. Upon the approval of the city manager or designee, collection of system development charges, building fees, and utility connection charges to serve single-family or multifamily residences shall be deferred at the request of a private or public nonprofit organization which is developing or constructing housing units for low-income households. To qualify for such deferral, deferral requests shall be made on forms provided by the city.

For mixed-income/mixed-use development, the amount of the fees deferred shall be a percentage proportionate to the low-income housing provided; e.g., if 20 percent of the square-footage of the project is dedicated to low-income housing, 20 percent of the total fees would be eligible for deferral up to the limit specified in subsection F of this section.

D. Recording. All deferrals granted shall be recorded as a real property lien until the deferral has been repaid to the city, or waived as provided in this chapter. The lien shall run with the land and apply to subsequent owners.

E. Repayment of Deferrals. All amounts deferred for low-income single-family or multifamily housing applicants pursuant to this section shall be reimbursed to the city in the applicable utility, as follows:

1. The applicant (“private or public nonprofit organizations”) shall record a real property lien, in a form approved by the city, agreeing and covenanting that the property will be sold or rented to a person or persons who meet, at the time of certificate of occupancy, the eligibility requirements of this section. The agreement shall specify the waiver/repayment period, criteria for waiver, reporting requirements and shall acknowledge the city’s right to audit (pursuant to subsection  G of this section).

a. For projects subject to an equivalent housing program: If the applicant conclusively demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the city manager, that the units will be monitored by a federal, state, or city program that requires units be reserved for low-income households for a minimum of 20 years, the city manager may waive the lien, city reporting requirement and eligible fees.

b. For all other projects: If, after 20 years from the date of certificate of occupancy, the applicant demonstrates the property has been consistently sold/rented to households meeting the eligibility requirements in this code, then no repayment is required, subject to subsection (E)(1)(c) of this section.

c. If within 20 years of the date of the certificate of occupancy the property is sold or rented, and the new buyer or tenant does not meet the eligibility requirements of this section, then repayment of the deferred fee is required in full with interest thereon at a rate commensurate with the annual one-year U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, computed annually on unpaid balances. Interest calculated pursuant to this section shall not be compounded.

Repayment of deferred fees shall be secured with a real estate security instrument as approved by the city attorney. Such instrument shall be senior to all other security instruments securing loans on the property to the extent allowed by law.

F. Limitation.

1. The program is limited as follows:

a. For eligible single-family units: For building fees and utility connection charges, four dwelling units per applicant per year; for SDCs, no limit.

b. For eligible multifamily units: For building fees and utility connection charges, up to $10,000 per project; for SDCs, no limit.

2. Requests for deferrals above the limit are subject to approval by the city council on a case-by-case basis. The council would evaluate, among other things, number of entities expected to request deferrals within the current budget cycle, the impact to city department budgets from processing an increased number of deferral requests.

G. Reporting.

1. Fee Deferral Report Content. Within the time periods specified in subsection (G)(2) of this section, the owners of property with an active fee deferral shall submit to the city finance director:

a. A signed affidavit that units are occupied in accordance with the terms of the lien.

b. Any additional information deemed necessary by the finance director to determine compliance with the terms of the lien.

c. Acknowledgment that the city retains the right to audit as per the terms of the lien.

Chapter 3.44 DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS PROPERTY – LONG-TERM LEASES

Sections:

3.44.010    Purpose – Decision-making process.

3.44.020    Definitions.

3.44.030    Policies for determining that property is surplus or should be designated for affordable housing purposes.

3.44.040    Procedures for determining that property is surplus – Real and utility property.

3.44.050    Process for disposition of surplus property.

3.44.060    Exceptions.


3.44.010 Purpose – Decision-making process.

The city of Port Townsend owns and operates real and personal property needed for the effective provision and management of municipal services, including but not limited to parks, recreation and utility services. The city council recognizes that unlike private enterprises, the city owns and manages public property for many purposes, including many activities which do not produce revenues or profits for the city. It is the policy of the city of Port Townsend to provide the best possible stewardship and management of municipal assets in the best interests of the citizens of Port Townsend and for the enhancement and protection of the natural and built environment. 

Furthermore, the city council recognizes and supports the public benefits derived from the provision of affordable housing. Affordable housing needs and opportunities shall be considered before surplusing public lands, and consideration shall be given to disposing property for affordable housing needs or retaining properties in order to meet affordable housing needs. Pursuant to RCW 35.21.687, it is the city’s intent to identify and catalog real property owned by the city that is no longer required for its purposes and is or may be suitable for the development of affordable housing for very low-income, low-income, and moderate-income households as defined in RCW 43.63A.510. The identification and cataloging of such properties would be considered a preliminary identification and cataloging pending completion of the processes outlined in this chapter.

A. City Council Decisions. The city council shall make all decisions that real property is surplus to the city’s needs in accordance with Chapters 35.94 and 39.33 RCW, or whether property should be designated to meet affordable housing needs and surplused or retained for that purpose. Decisions should be based upon established criteria, and only after seeking public review and comment regarding all proposed determinations that property which is subject to this chapter is surplus to city needs, or whether property should be designated to meet affordable housing needs and surplused or retained for that purpose. This chapter requires that, with the exception of leases of city-owned real property of less than one year (including property management agreements), the city council shall hold a public hearing prior to disposing of real property or designating that the property may meet affordable housing needs and be surplused or retained for that purpose. 

B. City Manager Decisions. The city manager shall be authorized to make all decisions that personal property is surplus to the city’s needs, based upon the criteria established in this chapter. Items which cannot be used or re-assigned to another department shall be recommended to the city manager for disposal in accordance with this chapter. If the surplus personal property exceeds $10,000 in value or the personal property was acquired by the city for utility purposes, the city manager shall hold an administrative hearing prior to disposal pursuant to RCW 39.33.020 and this chapter. The city manager shall be authorized to make decisions to lease real property and to negotiate property management agreements for lease terms not to exceed one year, without holding an administrative hearing. (Ord. 3174 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3055 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 2741 § 2, 2000; Ord. 2682 § 1, 1999).


3.44.020 Definitions.

A. “Commercially reasonable sale” means a sale or other conveyance that is an “arms length” arrangement, for the fair market value of the property. A commercially reasonable sale or conveyance may be by auction, private sale, trade-in as a component of replacement of obsolete property for new property, sealed bids, or by broker or agent listing. City employees and elected officials shall be prohibited from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any city surplus property.

B. “Disposition” means the lease or sale of property or other disposition as defined in this chapter.

C. “Housing, affordable,” “housing, very low-income,” “housing, low-income” and “housing, moderate-income,” as used in this chapter, shall be as defined in RCW 43.63A.510 as stated herein, or as hereafter amended by the state legislature: 

1. “Affordable housing” means residential housing that is rented or owned by a person who qualifies as a very low-income, low-income, or moderate-income household or who is from a special needs population, and whose monthly housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, do not exceed 30 percent of the household’s monthly income.

2. “Very low-income household” means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose income is at or below 50 percent of the median income, adjusted for household size, for the county where the affordable housing is located.

3. “Low-income household” means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose income is more than 50 percent but is at or below 80 percent of the median income where the affordable housing is located.

4. “Moderate-income household” means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose income is more than 80 percent but is at or below 115 percent of the median income where the affordable housing is located.

D. “Nonprofit corporation, qualified” as used in this chapter means private or public corporations duly organized according to the laws of the state of Washington, which non-profit corporations are exempt from taxation under USC 501(c) as amended, and which have a proven ability to provide affordable housing or can otherwise show an ability to do so and meet obligations that may be imposed in a conveyance of property to meet affordable housing needs. For purposes of donation of surplus personal property, this term shall also mean a nonprofit corporation that serves or benefits low-income or very low-income persons or persons with disabilities.

E. “Property” as defined by this chapter means all real property (real estate) owned in fee simple title by the city of Port Townsend, located both within the city’s incorporated municipal boundaries and outside city limits. “Property” shall also mean all personal property (non-real estate) and all real and personal property originally acquired for public utility purposes. “Property” shall not include public streets, alleys and rights-of-way which are subject to vacation and disposition in accordance with Chapter 12.20 PTMC. “Property” shall not include any equity interest in real or personal property held or owned by the city except for real estate security interests taken or released to secure the installation of development improvements. (Ord. 3174 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3055 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 2741 § 2, 2000; Ord. 2682 § 1, 1999).


3.44.030 Policies for determining that property is surplus or should be designated for affordable housing purposes.

A. Real Property. The city council shall review, every three years, or on another regular basis, the city ownership of real property. The intent of this review shall be to ensure the optimum utilization of the capital assets of the city of Port Townsend. All determinations by the city council in accordance with this chapter shall be within the discretion of the city council, acting within its legislative, proprietary authority as provided in Chapter 35A.11 RCW. With the exception of leases not to exceed one year, and the negotiation of property management agreements, determinations that real property is surplus to city needs or whether property should be designated to meet affordable housing needs and surplused or retained for that purpose shall be made after holding a duly noticed public hearing, and shall be based, at a minimum, upon the city council’s consideration of the following criteria:

1. Real property should perform a valuable public function. In making this determination, the council should consider both current use and any foreseeable future use. Property may serve a valuable public function if the property provides both tangible and intangible returns to the city, including but not limited to preservation of sensitive natural habitat, stormwater or flood management and control, current or future utility-related needs, passive or active open space and recreation enjoyment, implementation of comprehensive plan goals and policies, and future investment potential.

2. If the property is determined to serve a valuable public function, the city council should determine if this function could be served more effectively, and/or more appropriately, by another property in current city ownership.

3. If the property is determined not to serve a valuable public function, the city council should determine if a potential future use, or other compelling reason exists to retain this property, based upon the following nonexclusive criteria:

a. The council should determine if the property has been identified in the Port Townsend comprehensive plan or any functional or subarea plans, as having potential future value to the city;

b. The council should request that the city manager and/or department heads review and identify whether there are any previously unidentified potential future uses of the property;

c. The council should determine whether there are contractual or other restraints on the title to the property which would limit or preclude sale. If such restraints exist, upon consultation with the city attorney, the council should determine the difficulty in removing such restraints;

d. The council should determine whether the net future value of the property, based upon current appreciation, is greater than what would be reasonably expected through fund returns;

e. The council should determine whether the return on investment would be greater through management of the property, and/or property development for city use, rather than through sale; and

f. The council should determine all tax consequences of the decision to retain the property versus a decision to declare the property to be surplus and dispose of the property.

4. The city council should determine if the property may be suitable for affordable housing and, if so, whether it should be designated to meet affordable housing needs. “Suitable for affordable housing” means the property is located within the city’s urban growth area (UGA), is generally suitable for development, and housing development is compatible with the neighborhood. 

If the property may be suitable for affordable housing, the city council shall hold a hearing on whether the property should be designated to meet affordable housing needs and surplused or retained for that purpose, or whether the property should be retained for some other public purpose, or surplused without making provision for affordable housing. If the property is designated to meet affordable housing needs, then the city would follow the disposition process in PTMC 3.44.050.

B. Personal Property – Interdepartmental Transfers. If a department head or authorized city representative has city personal property under his or her control or supervision which is deemed surplus to the department’s use, the employee shall notify the city manager, who shall in turn notify interested department heads, supervisors or other city representatives, and give them an opportunity to review their need for the property. If any of such persons desire to acquire and use the proposed surplus property for their department, unless the manager disagrees, the property may be transferred to the requesting department head, or other authorized representative, for use by that department, for city business. Personal property originally acquired with utility funds may be transferred to and used by a non-utility department if the property is of de minimis monetary value. If no request for use of proposed surplus property is received, the city manager shall consider whether to declare the property surplus to the city’s needs under the criteria stated in this section. Upon finding that the property is surplus to the city’s needs, the city manager may then proceed to direct the disposal of the same by a commercially reasonable sale (including live or electronic auction), or as otherwise provided for in this chapter.

C. Personal Property – Criteria for Declaring Surplus. Upon recommendation of the department head, and after determining that there is no need for the use of the property by another department, the city manager shall hold a duly noticed administrative hearing, as required by this chapter. The city manager may declare property surplus based upon one or more of the following criteria:

1. The city has or soon will have no practical, efficient, or appropriate use for the property, nor will it have such a use for the property in the near future;

2. The purpose served by the property can be accomplished by use of a better, less costly, or more efficient alternative;

3. The purpose served by the property or its use no longer exists as determined by a change of policy evidenced by an ordinance or resolution of the city council;

4. The property is damaged, worn out, or otherwise inoperable and the cost of repairing the same is unwise or impractical.

D. Personal Property – Public Utility Property. In addition to the general criteria for finding that personal property is surplus to the city’s needs, upon the recommendation of the public works director or designee, and after conclusion of a duly noticed administrative hearing, the city manager shall consider whether personal property owned by the city and originally acquired for utility purposes is obsolete or not required for providing continued utility service. (Ord. 3174 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3055 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 2741 § 2, 2000; Ord. 2682 § 1, 1999).


3.44.040 Procedures for determining that property is surplus – Real and utility property. 

All final determinations of the city to declare real property, real and personal property acquired for utility purposes, and personal property with an estimated value in excess of $10,000 as surplus to the city’s needs, or whether real property should be designated to meet affordable housing needs and surplused or retained for that purpose, and whether the sale of surplus property shall be undertaken, are made only after conclusion of the public process as provided in this section; provided, however, this chapter shall not be construed as limiting the authority of the city council to conduct executive sessions as authorized by Washington law:

A. Prior to making any final determinations that property owned by the city is surplus to the city’s needs, or whether real property should be designated to meet affordable housing needs and surplused or retained for that purpose, and prior to negotiating any conveyance, the city shall hold a public hearing. The public hearing shall be held prior to undertaking any brokerage or real estate agent listing arrangements. The city manager is authorized to hold administrative hearings;

B. At least 10 days and not more than 25 days before the hearing, the city shall publish a public notice in display advertising form, setting forth the date, time and place of the public hearing, published at least once, in the official newspaper. Notice should also be mailed to the Peninsula Housing Authority and other housing providers serving the community. The city shall also circulate a news release;

C. The public hearing notices shall identify the property by an easily understood description (i.e., not exclusively by metes and bounds legal description), and shall describe any proposed use of the land involved, if any is contemplated;

D. After the public hearing, if the city council determines that the property is surplus to the city’s needs, the city council or city manager shall adopt a resolution (or administrative decision) making findings that the property is surplus to the city’s needs, and finding conformity with the adopted policies of the city which govern disposition of surplus property. The resolution or administrative decision shall state the estimated fair market value of the property; and

E. The resolution or administrative decision should state the terms and conditions for the actual disposition of the property which the council finds to be in the best public interest. With real property, the resolution shall state the property shall not be sold for less than the property’s appraised value; provided, the city council may approve an exchange of property without an appraisal based on a determination that the value of property received will be of equal or greater value than the property being surplused, and may approve a sale without an appraisal if it determines an appraisal is not necessary because there is other reliable indication of value (for example, assessed value, or other market transactions). The value received in a property exchange may include intangible values or benefits received by the city through implementation of comprehensive plan goals and policies (including goals and policies of the city’s functional and subarea plans) and provision of other public health, safety and welfare benefits to the city. (Ord. 3174 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3055 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 2741 § 2, 2000; Ord. 2682 § 1, 1999).


3.44.050 Process for disposition of surplus property.

A. Commercially Reasonable Sale or Conveyance. Unless otherwise excepted in subsection B of this section, the actual sale or other conveyance of property shall be commercially reasonable. Real property will require an independent appraisal, except as provided in PTMC 3.44.040(E) and this section.

B. Special Disposition. If the council finds, following a hearing, that property should be designated to meet affordable housing needs and surplused or retained for that purpose, the council may direct the city manager to proceed with special disposition (which may include disposition at less than market or appraised value, and without appraisal), under any one of the following conditions:

1. Intergovernmental transfers (see subsection D of this section);

2. Transfer to qualified public or private nonprofit entities;

3. Transfer to the Port Townsend Public Development Authority or other public development authority created to develop or manage affordable housing. 

Conveyance by special disposition may include (without limitation) sale, lease, options to purchase, lease purchase transactions, or public-private partnership, and may occur by use of negotiations or bidding, as the council deems desirable, fair and appropriate. The council may direct publishing or other distribution of a request for proposal (“RFP”) and/or request for qualifications (“RFQ”). Following review and recommendation by the city manager concerning a proposed special disposition, the council shall determine whether the proposed special disposition should be approved, not approved, or approved with conditions. The council reserves the right to reject any and all proposals. If a disposition for affordable housing is not approved, the council may determine whether to request other proposals or solicitations, retain the property for affordable housing in order to consider a disposition in the future, or (following a hearing) determine to designate the property for another public use (other than affordable housing) and/or to surplus the property.

The city manager may determine that personal property has little or no commercial value, or that the cost to sell or dispose of the property exceeds the estimate net proceeds. In that case, surplus personal property may be disposed of by salvage contract, donation to a qualified nonprofit, or safely disposed of as trash. 

C. Lease of Public Property. The city may authorize the lease or sublease of any property, including real property, under such terms and conditions as the city may deem desirable, fair and appropriate, either by use of negotiations or bidding in the best interest of the city. Generally, leases of real property shall not be granted for a period of more than five years, although leases of longer terms may be appropriate. Leases of real property may be granted for a period of more than five years when appraisal or economic data demonstrate a sufficient assurance that the city will receive fair market rental value, including through monetary payment and in-kind services, and the lease arrangement will allow rental adjustments in the future as market conditions change.

D. Intergovernmental Transfers of Property. For all intergovernmental transfers of property, the council shall make its determination that the property is surplus to the city’s needs in accordance with this chapter, and all transfers shall be made pursuant to Chapter 39.44 RCW, or such other state statute as may be applicable. With all intergovernmental transfers of property, the city council shall consider conveying the property subject to a restrictive covenant which describes the allowed intended use of the property and prohibits the acquiring municipality from conveying the property to nongovernmental parties or entities.

E. Utility Property. In the event property declared surplus was originally acquired for public utility purposes, the revenues must be used for utility-related purposes, related to the utility which funded the original purchase, or in the event there shall remain no such utility, said funds shall be otherwise distributed as allowed by state law. All revenues from the sale of utility property shall be deposited in the appropriate utility account or fund. Proceeds from the sale of capital property shall be used for capital purposes.

F. Disposition of Proceeds – Nonutility Property. Proceeds from the sale of nonutility property shall be deposited and appropriated as determined by the city council. Proceeds from the sale of capital property shall be used for capital purposes.

G. Restrictive Covenants. Prior to disposing of real property, the city council shall consider the need to impose restrictive covenants for the purpose of protecting important public interests, including but not limited to provision of affordable housing, preservation and protection of environmentally sensitive areas identified on properties, stormwater control, open space protection, shoreline development use, and other restrictions controlling land use to implement city policy or to ensure that the property is used and developed in a manner which is compatible with the neighborhood character.

H. Release and Hold Harmless Agreement. Prior to disposing of any personal property, the city shall require the transferee to execute an acknowledgment of risks, release and waiver and hold harmless agreement, including a provision that the property is accepted “as is,” without express or implied warranties as to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. This agreement shall be made on a form approved by the city attorney. (Ord. 3174 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3055 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 2741 § 2, 2000; Ord. 2682 § 1, 1999).


3.44.060 Exceptions. 

This chapter does not apply where other city code provisions apply, or provisions of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) impose special conditions for the disposition of municipal property. Exceptions include, but are not limited to, the following: disposition of public art, disposition of library material, equipment rentals, and disposition of abandoned or junk vehicles. (Ord. 3174 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 3055 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011).

Upon the city manager’s adoption of an appropriate administrative procedure, in accordance with RCW 39.30.040, local sales tax and other locally generated tax revenues may be considered in determining the lowest bid for the purchase of supplies, materials and equipment.

Where possible, three quotations shall be sufficient to determine a competitive price for any such purchase except for items which, for a practical matter, can only be obtained from a single source. Said purchases shall be awarded to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder.

C. Small Works Roster.

1. The city manager may establish a small works roster, in accordance with the requirements set forth in RCW 35.22.620 and adopted administrative policies and procedures, for contracts within the dollar amounts set forth in RCW 39.04.155 and as hereafter amended.

All purchases of overall electronic data processing and telecommunication systems, including equipment, software, and services, shall be made pursuant to the competitive negotiation process, rather than through competitive bidding, as authorized and described in RCW 39.04.270, as now adopted and hereafter amended.

3.46.080 Competitive bidding procedures.

The city manager shall call for competitive bids where required.

B. Rejection of Bids. The city manager may reject without cause all bids and may re-advertise for bids pursuant to the procedures herein described.

2. When the contract is let, all bid bonds shall be returned to the bidders except that of the successful bidder which shall be retained until a contract is entered into and a bond to perform the work furnished as provided above. If the successful bidder fails to enter into the contract in accordance with the bid and furnish such bond within 10 days from the date at which the bidder is notified of bid award, the bid bond shall be forfeited.

E. Award of Bid. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city shall accept the bid of the lowest responsive, responsible bidder, and subject to supplemental bidder responsibility authorized in RCW 39.04.350, including any amendments which the city makes part of the bidding documents. “Responsible” includes criteria established in RCW 39.04.350, including any amendments.

(Ord. 3106 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2715 § 2, 2000).


3.46.090 Exemptions to competitive bidding requirements.

A. Sole Source Purchases and Special Market Conditions. Purchases which by their nature are not adapted to competitive bidding, such as purchases of repairs and purchases of items which may, as a practical matter, only be purchased from a single source, shall not be subject to the competitive bidding requirements of this chapter. Purchases for materials, supplies, equipment or repairs which are made under special market conditions, e.g., where the item is offered to the city at a highly favorable price and will be sold before the city has the time to comply with formal bidding requirements, or where the city must act quickly or through a specific channel to take advantage of special circumstances to achieve a lower cost, shall not be subject to the competitive bidding requirements of this chapter. Where the city makes sole source purchases or special market condition purchases without formal bidding compliance, the city council shall pass a resolution, or the city manager shall prepare a statement in cases within the manager’s authority, reciting the situation and setting forth the reasons for invoking this section.

B. Auctions, Closeout and Bankruptcy Sales. If an authorized purchasing coordinator determines that supplies, material, or equipment can be purchased by any public auction, closeout sale, bankruptcy sale or other similar sale, and makes a finding that a purchase at any such auction or sale will be made at a cost below the market cost, the city manager may authorize said purchases.

C. Exchanges. The city may by agreement exchange supplies, materials or equipment with other public agencies.

D. Interlocal Agreements in Letting of Contracts for Commodities or Services. In accordance with RCW 35.77.020, 36.75.200, 39.34.080, and 47.24.050, the city manager may enter into joint purchase agreements with any and all other public agencies within the state for the purchase of any commodity or service as permitted by state law, where it is determined by the manager to be in the best interest of the city, without individual approval of the city council, and so long as the contract is consistent with the approved annual budget. Prior to commencing a bid process for significant purchases, the city manager shall make reasonable efforts to find opportunities for joint purchases with other public agencies in accordance with this section. 

E. Emergency Purchases. Under emergency conditions as provided herein, the public bidding requirements are suspended. Publication notices may be waived for emergency purchases and other contracts as provided by law. However, where the conditions allow sufficient time, authorized employees shall demonstrate a reasonable effort to contact two or more vendors for price quotations, and/or to follow bidding procedures to the best extent possible under the circumstances. 

1. Emergencies Occurring After Regular Business Hours. In the event that an emergency should arise after office hours, which emergency requires immediate action on the part of the city department involved for the protection of the best interests of the city, or should such a situation arise on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday and where it is not possible or convenient to reach the city manager, any necessary purchase shall be made by the city department for which the purchase is necessary. The purchase shall be reported to the city manager at the first of the next business day.

2. Other Emergencies. In the event of a natural disaster or manmade disaster or emergency, and where it is necessary to the health, safety or welfare of the community that immediate action and execution of a public work be undertaken, public bidding requirements shall be suspended during the pendency of the emergency condition.

3. City Council Action. Where public works projects are undertaken in emergency conditions, and without public bidding compliance, the city manager shall report the condition to the city council as soon as practicable. As soon as practicable, the city council shall pass a resolution declaring the emergency, reciting the facts constituting the emergency, and waiving the public bidding requirements.

F. Petty Cash.

1. Petty cash purchase shall not exceed $100.00 per project, except in emergencies. All requests for petty cash funds or reimbursement of petty expenditures shall be reconciled by a receipt or paid invoice along with a completed petty cash form.

2. Reimbursements and reconciliations of petty cash funds shall be made within 30 days of the transaction. No personal checks shall be cashed out of the petty cash fund. 

3. Purchasing Cards. Purchasing cards may be used for purchases; provided, however purchasing cards shall not be used until the city manager adopts policies and procedures governing their use, in accordance with Washington law. 

G. Real Property. Acquisition of real property is exempt from the competitive bidding requirements of this policy. Upon approval of the city council, the city manager may proceed to acquire real property through negotiation. The city council shall authorize all real property purchases. Negotiations to purchase real property shall be based upon an independent appraisal of the property. The city shall not pay more than fair market value for any real property without prior council approval. All property acquisition negotiations shall be conducted in accordance with the city’s property acquisition policies and procedures and shall comply with Chapter 8.26 RCW (the State Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Act, as amended). (Ord. 2715 § 2, 2000).


3.46.100 Prohibited practices. 

A. Collusion Among Bidders. Any agreement or collusion among bidders or prospective bidders to either buy or sell, in restraint of freedom of competition, be it agreement to bid a fixed price, or otherwise, shall render the bids of such bidders void. Such bidders may be subject to possible exclusion from future bidding with the city when determined by the city manager to be in the best interest of the city.

B. Disclosure of Formal Bid Contents. Any disclosure in advance of the opening bids, of any information contained in the sealed or formal bid, made or permitted by a city officer or employee may render each bid void either by the city or the parties submitting bids. Appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against both the persons revealing the information and the persons using the information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all bids submitted by bidders taking advantage of any information revealed contrary to this section shall at once become null and void. The city manager shall adopt policies and procedures to ensure that all bids remain secure and confidential prior to bid opening.

C. Gratuities. With the exception of normal business and social courtesies, or donations publicly given and accepted, the acceptance of any gift or gratuity in the form of cash, merchandise or any other thing of significant value, as determined by the Attorney General’s opinion, by an official or employee of the city from any vendor or contractor, or prospective vendor or contractor, shall be prohibited. 

D. Employee or City Official-Owned Businesses. In accordance with Chapter 42.23 RCW, Code of Ethics for Municipal Officers – Contract Interests, city goods or services shall not be obtained from businesses in which city officials, employees or their immediate family members have a majority ownership interest, or in any situation where the city official or employee shall be beneficially interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction. This prohibition is subject to all exceptions pursuant to RCW 42.23.030. 

E. Sale of Materials and Supplies. Except as provided by state law, including RCW 35.21.275, the city shall not use its purchasing power or lend its credit to acquire goods or services for any private party, nor shall the city sell its materials or supplies to the public except when said materials have been declared surplus and disposed of as provided in Chapter 3.44 PTMC. (Ord. 2715 § 2, 2000).

3. The city council determines to establish the level of funding at such time as substantial construction plans for municipal construction projects have been prepared and approved by the city council; provided, the city council, in its sole discretion, may choose to limit or eliminate funding in the event of a significant budget overrun for a particular project, if it believes such action to be in the public interest.

The city council indicates its intention to use a selection process and public process which incorporates members of the city’s arts commission, and which provides opportunity to citizens to comment on any aspect of funding, purchase, erection, siting and installation of works of public art. 

For public art proposed for installation in an area subject to design review, the city council will process the installation through the city’s design review processes. 

Once installed, art work is solely owned and maintained by the city. City council has final authority to relocate, remove, or destroy artwork, following recommendation from the arts commission.

A), 2019; Ord. 2959 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2882 § 1, 2004).

5.04A.030 Definitions.

In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall be applied. Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular. 

“Business” includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the taxpayer or to another person or class, directly or indirectly.

“Business and occupation tax” or “gross receipts tax” means a tax imposed on or measured by the value of products, the gross income of the business, or the gross proceeds of sales, as the case may be, and that is the legal liability of the business.

“Commercial or industrial use” means the following uses of products, including byproducts, by the extractor or manufacturer thereof:

A. Any use as a consumer; and

B. The manufacturing of articles, substances or commodities.

“Delivery” means the transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the seller and the buyer or the buyer’s representative. Delivery to an employee of a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer’s representative first takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over the property. “Dominion and control” means the buyer has the ability to put the property to the buyer’s own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer’s representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer has no right to return the property to the seller other than under a warranty contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to itself. A buyer’s representative is a person, other than an employee of the buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a buyer’s representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (Title 62A RCW) do not determine when or where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of taxation.

“Digital automated service,” “digital code,” and “digital goods” have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.192.

“Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(b).

“Eligible gross receipts tax” means a tax which:

A. Is imposed on the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within PTMC 5.04A.050; and

B. Is measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts and is not an income tax or value-added tax; and

C. Is not, pursuant to law or custom, separately stated from the sales price; and

D. Is not a sales or use tax, business license fee, franchise fee, royalty or severance tax measured by volume or weight, or concession charge, or payment for the use and enjoyment of property, property right or a privilege; and

E. Is a tax imposed by a local jurisdiction, whether within or without the state of Washington, and not by a country, state, province, or any other non-local jurisdiction above the county level.

Engaging in Business.

A. The term “engaging in business” means commencing, conducting, or continuing in business, and also the exercise of corporate or franchise powers, as well as liquidating a business when the liquidators thereof hold themselves out to the public as conducting such business.

B. This section sets forth examples of activities that constitute engaging in business in the city, and establishes safe harbors for certain of those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimis business activities in the city without having to register and obtain a business license or pay city business and occupation taxes. The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business” in subsection A of this definition. If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the city shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and applicable law.

C. Without being all inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted within the city by a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker or another acting on its behalf constitutes engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business license:

2. Owning, renting, leasing, using, or maintaining an office, place of business, or other establishment in the city.

7. Soliciting, negotiating, or approving franchise, license, or other similar agreements.

8. Collecting current or delinquent accounts.

10. Providing disinfecting and pest control services, employment and labor pool services, home nursing care, janitorial services, appraising, landscape architectural services, security system services, surveying, and real estate services including the listing of homes and managing real property.

11. Rendering professional services such as those provided by accountants, architects, attorneys, auctioneers, consultants, engineers, professional athletes, barbers, baseball clubs and other sports organizations, chemists, consultants, psychologists, court reporters, dentists, doctors, detectives, laboratory operators, teachers, veterinarians.

12. Meeting with customers or potential customers, even when no sales or orders are solicited at the meetings.

1. Meeting with suppliers of goods and services as a customer.

2. Meeting with government representatives in their official capacity, other than those performing contracting or purchasing functions.

3. Attending meetings, such as board meetings, retreats, seminars, and conferences, or other meetings wherein the person does not provide training in connection with tangible personal property sold by the person or on its behalf. This provision does not apply to any board of directors member or attendee engaging in business such as a member of a board of directors who attends a board meeting.

4. Renting tangible or intangible property as a customer when the property is not used in the city.

5. Attending, but not participating in, a “trade show” or “multiple vendor events.” Persons participating at a trade show shall review the city’s trade show or multiple vendor event ordinances.

6. Conducting advertising through the mail.

7. Soliciting sales by phone from a location outside the city.

E. A seller located outside the city merely delivering goods into the city by means of common carrier is not required to register and obtain a business license; provided, that it engages in no other business activities in the city. Such activities do not include those in subsection D of this definition.

The city expressly intends that engaging in business include any activity sufficient to establish nexus for purposes of applying the tax under the law and the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Washington. Nexus is presumed to continue as long as the taxpayer benefits from the activity that constituted the original nexus generating contact or subsequent contacts.

“Extracting” is the activity engaged in by an extractor and is reportable under the extracting classification.

B. Where such products, including byproducts, are extracted or manufactured for commercial or industrial use; and where such products, including byproducts, are shipped, transported or transferred out of the city, or to another person, without prior sale or are sold under circumstances such that the gross proceeds from the sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale; the value shall correspond as nearly as possible to the gross proceeds from sales in this state of similar products of like quality and character, and in similar quantities by other taxpayers, plus the amount of subsidies or bonuses ordinarily payable by the purchaser or by any third person with respect to the extraction, manufacture, or sale of such products. In the absence of sales of similar products as a guide to value, such value may be determined upon a cost basis. In such cases, there shall be included every item of cost attributable to the particular article or article extracted or manufactured, including direct and indirect overhead costs. The director may prescribe rules for the purpose of ascertaining such values.

1. Upon every person engaging within the city in business as an extractor; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products, including byproducts, extracted within the city for sale or for commercial or industrial use, multiplied by the rate of 0.2 of one percent. The measure of the tax is the value of the products, including byproducts, so extracted, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the city.

2. Upon every person engaging within the city in business as a manufacturer, as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products, including byproducts, manufactured within the city, multiplied by the rate of 0.2 of one percent.

3. Upon every person engaging within the city in the business of making sales at wholesale, except persons taxable under subsection (A)(4) of this section; as to such persons, the amount of tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the gross proceeds of such sales of the business without regard to the place of delivery of articles, commodities or merchandise sold, multiplied by the rate of 0.2 of one percent.

4. Upon every person engaging within the city in the business of making sales at retail, as to such persons, the amount of tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the gross proceeds of such sales of the business, without regard to the place of delivery of articles, commodities or merchandise sold, multiplied by the rate of 0.2 of one percent.

6. Upon every person engaging within the city in the business of making sales of retail services; as to such persons, the amount of tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the gross proceeds of sales multiplied by the rate of 0.2 of one percent.

7. Upon every other person engaging within the city in any business activity other than or in addition to those enumerated in the above subsections; as to such persons, the amount of tax on account of such activities shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of 0.2 of one percent.

A. Persons who engage in business activities that are within the purview of two or more subsections of PTMC 5.04A.050 shall be taxable under each applicable subsection.

B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if imposition of the city’s tax would place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or violate constitutional requirements a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit to the extent necessary to preserve the validity of the city’s tax, and still apply the city tax to as much of the taxpayer’s activities as may be subject to the city’s taxing authority.

C. To take the credit authorized by this section, a taxpayer must be able to document that the amount of tax sought to be credited was paid upon the same gross receipts used in computing the tax against which the credit is applied.

A), 2019; Ord. 2959 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2882 § 1, 2004).


5.04A.075 Deductions to prevent multiple taxation of manufacturing activities and prior to January 1, 2008, transactions involving more than one city with an eligible gross receipts tax.

A. Amounts Subject to an Eligible Gross Receipts Tax in Another City That Also Maintains Nexus over the Same Activity. For taxes due prior to January 1, 2008, a taxpayer that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax on the same activity in more than one jurisdiction may be entitled to a deduction as follows:

1. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax, with respect to a sale of goods or services, to a jurisdiction in which the goods are delivered or the services are provided may deduct an amount equal to the gross receipts used to measure that tax from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

2. Notwithstanding the above, a person that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax in more than one jurisdiction on the gross income derived from intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall assign those gross receipts to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located).

3. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax on the privilege of accepting or executing a contract with another city may deduct an amount equal to the contract price used to measure the tax due to the other city from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

B. Person Manufacturing Products Within and Without. A person manufacturing products within the city using products manufactured by the same person outside the city may deduct from the measure of the manufacturing tax the value of products manufactured outside the city and included in the measure of an eligible gross receipts tax paid to the other jurisdiction with respect to manufacturing such products. (Ord. 3242 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 2959 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2882 § 1, 2004).


5.04A.076 Assignment of gross income derived from intangibles.

Gross income derived from the sale of intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall be assigned to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located). (Ord. 3242 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 2959 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2882 § 1, 2004).


5.04A.077 Allocation and apportionment of income when activities take place in more than one jurisdiction.

Effective January 1, 2008, gross income, other than persons subject to the provisions of Chapter 82.14A RCW, shall be allocated and apportioned as follows:

A. Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as service or royalties under PTMC 5.04.050(A)(7) shall be allocated to the location where the activity takes place.

B. In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.

C. In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:

1. The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller’s place of business;

2. If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;

3. If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;

4. If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and

5. If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.

D. If none of the methods in subsection C of this section for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (C)(5) of this section, then the city and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the city to use an alternative method under subsection (C)(4) of this section. The city may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (C)(5) of this section are not available and the taxpayer and the city are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.

E. For purposes of subsections (C)(1) through (C)(5) of this section, the following definitions apply:

1. “Digital automated services,” “digital codes,” and “digital goods” have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.192;

2. “Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(c); and

3. “Receive” has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.730.

F. Gross income derived from activities taxed as services and other activities taxed under PTMC 5.04A.050(A)(7) shall be apportioned to the city by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service income factor and the denominator of which is two.

1. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:

a. The individual is primarily assigned within the city;

b. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs 50 percent or more of his or her service for the tax period in the city; or

c. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform 50 percent or more of his or her service in the city and the employee resides in the city.

2. The service income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service income is in the city if the customer location is in the city.

3. Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service income factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the city, and the gross income is attributable under subsection (F)(2) of this section to a city or unincorporated area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (F)(3), “not taxable” means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under the standards in RCW 35.102.050 regardless of whether that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes such a tax.

4. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:

a. Separate accounting;

b. The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

c. The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; or

d. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

5. The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection (F)(4) of this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:

a. That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; and

b. That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable. The same burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

6. If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the tax administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F.

7. A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.

G. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

1. “Apportionable income” means the gross income of the business taxable under the service classifications of a city’s gross receipts tax, including income received from activities outside the city if the income would be taxable under the service classification if received from activities within the city, less any exemptions or deductions available.

2. “Business activities tax” means a tax measured by the amount of, or economic results of, business activity conducted in a city or county within the United States or within a foreign country.

3. “Compensation” means wages, salaries, commissions, and any other form of remuneration paid to individuals for personal services that are or would be included in the individual’s gross income under the Federal Internal Revenue Code.

4. “Customer” means a person or entity to whom the taxpayer makes a sale or renders services or from whom the taxpayer otherwise received gross income of the business.

5. “Customer location” means the following:

b. For a customer not engaged in business, if the service does not require the customer to be physically present:

i. The customer’s residence; or

ii. If the customer’s residence is not known, the customer’s billing/mailing address.

iii. At the customer’s commercial domicile if none of the above are known.

6. “Individual” means any individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee of that taxpayer.

7. “Primarily assigned” means the business location of the taxpayer where the individual performs his or her duties.

8. “Service-taxable income” or “service income” means gross income of the business subject to tax under either the service or royalty classification.

9. “Tax period” means the calendar year during which tax liability is accrued. If taxes are reported by a taxpayer on a basis more frequent than once per year, taxpayers shall calculate the factors for the previous calendar year for reporting in the current calendar year and correct the reporting for the previous year when the factors are calculated for that year, but not later than the end of the first quarter of the following year.

H. Assignment or apportionment of revenue under this section shall be made in accordance with and in full compliance with the provisions of the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution where applicable. (Ord. 3242 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3085 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2959 § 1, 2007).

As used in this section, the activities of printing, and of publishing newspapers, periodicals, or magazines, have the same meanings as attributed to those terms in RCW 82.04.280(1) by the Department of Revenue.

In computing tax, there may be deducted from the measure of tax under retailing or wholesaling amounts derived from the sale of tangible personal property that is delivered by the seller to the buyer or the buyer’s representative at a location outside the state of Washington.

B. Cash Discount Taken by Purchaser. In computing tax, there may be deducted from the measure of tax the cash discount amounts actually taken by the purchaser. This deduction is not allowed in arriving at the taxable amount under the extracting or manufacturing classifications with respect to articles produced or manufactured, the reported values of which, for the purposes of this tax, have been computed according to the “value of product” provisions.

C. Credit Losses of Accrual Basis Taxpayers. In computing tax, there may be deducted from the measure of tax the amount of credit losses actually sustained by taxpayers whose regular books of account are kept upon an accrual basis.

D. Constitutional Prohibitions. In computing tax, there may be deducted from the measure of the tax amounts derived from business which the city is prohibited from taxing under the Constitution of the State of Washington or the Constitution of the United States.

E. Receipts from the Sale of Tangible Personal Property and Retail Services Delivered Outside the City but Within Washington. Effective January 1, 2008, amounts included in the gross receipts reported on the tax return derived from the sale of tangible personal property delivered to the buyer or the buyers representative outside the city but within the state of Washington may be deducted from the measure of tax under the retailing, retail services, or wholesaling classification.

F. Professional Employer Services. In computing the tax, a professional employer organization may deduct from the calculation of gross income the gross income of the business derived from performing professional employer services that is equal to the portion of the fee charged to a client that represents the actual cost of wages and salaries, benefits, workers’ compensation, payroll taxes, withholding, or other assessments paid to or on behalf of a covered employee by the professional employer organization under a professional employer agreement.

G. Interest on Investments or Loans Secured by Mortgages or Deeds of Trust. In computing tax, to the extent permitted by Chapter 82.14A RCW, there may be deducted from the measure of tax by those engaged in banking, loan, security or other financial businesses, amounts derived from interest received on investments or loans primarily secured by first mortgages or trust deeds on nontransient residential properties.

5.04A.120 Tax part of overhead.

It is not the intention of this chapter that the taxes or fees herein levied upon persons engaging in business be construed as taxes or fees upon the purchasers or customer, but that such taxes or fees shall be levied upon, and collectible from, the person engaging in the business activities herein designated and that such taxes or fees shall constitute a part of the cost of doing business of such persons. (Ord. 3242 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 2959 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2882 § 1, 2004).

5.04B.040 When due and payable – Reporting periods – Monthly, quarterly, and annual returns – Threshold provisions or relief from filing requirements – Computing time periods – Failure to file returns.

A. Other than any annual license fee or registration fee assessed under this chapter, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in quarterly installments for businesses whose gross receipts are equal to or exceeded $100,000 in the previous year, or that are estimated to equal or exceed $100,000 in the current year. At the director’s discretion, businesses may be assigned to a monthly or annual reporting period depending on the tax amount owing or type of tax. Until December 31, 2020, tax payments are due on or before the last day of the next month following the end of the assigned reporting period covered by the return. Effective January 1, 2021, tax payments are due on or before the time as provided in RCW 82.32.045(1), (2), and (3).

B. Taxes shall be paid as provided in this chapter and accompanied by a return on forms as prescribed by the director. The return shall be signed by the taxpayer personally or by a responsible officer or agent of the taxpayer. The individual signing the return shall swear or affirm that the information in the return is complete and true.

C. For businesses whose gross receipts are equal to or exceed $100,000, returns must be filed and returned by the due date whether or not any tax is owed.

D. For purposes of the tax imposed by Chapter 5.04A PTMC, any person whose value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business, subject to tax after all allowable deductions, is less than $100,000 in the current calendar year shall not be required to file a return.

E. A taxpayer that commences to engage in business activity shall file a return and pay the tax or fee for the portion of the reporting period during which the taxpayer is engaged in business activity.

F. Except as otherwise specifically provided by any other provision of this chapter, in computing any period of days prescribed by this chapter the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time runs shall not be included. The last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or city or federal legal holiday, in which case the last day of such period shall be the next succeeding day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or city or federal legal holiday.

G. If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to make a return as and when required in this chapter, the director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the director’s estimate of the tax or fees due. Such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 3184 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.050 Payment methods – Mailing returns or remittances – Time extension – Deposits – Recording payments – Payment must accompany return – NSF checks.

A. Taxes shall be paid to the director in United States currency by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, personal check, money order, cash, or by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic payment is authorized by the director. If payment so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered, shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the same as if such payment had not been tendered.

Acceptance of any sum by the director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.

B. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the city by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the post office upon the envelope containing it. The director may allow electronic filing of returns or remittances from any taxpayer. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the city electronically shall be deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the director.

C. If a written request is received prior to the due date, the director, for good cause, may grant, in writing, additional time within which to make and file returns.

D. The director shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received or refunded. The director shall apply payments first against all penalties and interest owing, and then upon the tax, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer.

E. For any return not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and shall be subject to the penalties and interest provided in this chapter.

F. Any payment made that is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for any other reason will not be considered received until payment by certified check, money order, or cash of the original amount due, plus a nonsufficient funds (NSF) charge of $20.00 is received by the director. Any license issued upon payment with an NSF check will be considered void, and shall be returned to the director. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the $20.00 NSF fee) is received.

G. The director is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or fees, when and as due under this chapter. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.060 Records to be preserved – Examination – Estoppel to question assessment.

Every person liable for any fee or tax imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of five years after filing a tax return, such records as may be necessary to determine the amount of any fee or tax for which the person may be liable; which records shall include copies of all federal income tax and state tax returns and reports made by the person. All books, records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other data including federal income tax and state tax returns and reports shall be open for examination at any time by the director or a duly authorized agent. Every person’s business premises shall be open for inspection or examination by the director or a duly authorized agent.

A. If a person does not keep the necessary books and records within the city, it shall be sufficient if such person (1) produces within the city such books and records as may be required by the director, or (2) bears the cost of examination by the director’s agent at the place where such books and records are kept; provided, that the person electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance to the director the estimated amount thereof including round-trip fare, lodging, meals and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon completion of the examination.

B. Any person who fails, or refuses a department request, to provide or make available records, or to allow inspection or examination of the business premises, shall be forever barred from questioning in any court action, the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the city for any period for which such records have not been provided, made available or kept and preserved, or in respect of which inspection or examination of the business premises has been denied. The director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.070 Accounting methods.

A. A taxpayer may file tax returns in each reporting period with amounts based upon cash receipts only if the taxpayer’s books of account are kept on a cash receipts basis. A taxpayer that does not regularly keep books of account on a cash receipts basis must file returns with amounts based on the accrual method.

B. The taxes imposed and the returns required hereunder shall be upon a calendar-year basis. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.080 Public work contracts – Payment of fee and tax before final payment for work.

The director may, before issuing any final payment to any person performing any public work contract for the city, require such person to pay in full all license fees or taxes due under this title from such person on account of such contract or otherwise, and may require such taxpayer to file with the director a verified list of all subcontractors supplying labor and/or materials to the person in connection with said public work. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.090 Underpayment of tax, interest, or penalty – Interest.

A. If, upon examination of any returns, or from other information obtained by the director, it appears that a tax or penalty less than that properly due has been paid, the director shall assess the additional amount found to be due and shall add thereto interest on the tax only. The director shall notify the person by mail of the additional amount, which shall become due and shall be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice, or within such time as the director may provide in writing.

B. 1. Interest imposed before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be computed from the last day of the month following the end of the reporting period and will continue to accrue until payment is made. In case of an audit the interest shall be computed from the first day of the month following each calendar year or portion thereof included in the audit period.

3. If subsection (B)(2) of this section is held to be invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.050 existing at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.095 Time in which assessment may be made.

The director shall not assess, or correct an assessment for, additional taxes, penalties, or interest due more than four years after the close of the calendar year in which they were incurred, except that the director may issue an assessment:

A. Against a person who is not currently registered or licensed or has not filed a tax return as required by this chapter for taxes due within the period commencing 10 years prior to the close of the calendar year in which the person was contacted in writing by the director;

B. Against a person that has committed fraud or who misrepresented a material fact; or

C. Against a person that has executed a written waiver of such limitations. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.100 Overpayment of tax, penalty, or interest – Credit or refund – Interest rate – Statute of limitations.

A. If, upon receipt of an application for a refund, or during an audit or examination of the taxpayer’s records and tax returns, the director determines that the amount of tax, penalty, or interest paid is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be credited to the taxpayer’s account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

B. The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying for, or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the director discovers that a refund or credit is due.

C. Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the director and by the issuance of a city check or warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the city may provide.

D. Any final judgment for which a recovery is granted by any court of competent jurisdiction for tax, penalties, interest, or costs paid by any person shall be paid in the same manner, as provided in subsection C of this section, upon the filing with the director a certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.

E. 1. Interest on overpayments of taxes for periods for any period before January 1, 2005, shall be the average federal short-term interest rate as outlined for assessments under PTMC 5.04B.090(B)(3) plus two percentage points.

2. For tax periods after December 31, 2004, the director shall compute interest on refunds or credits of amounts paid or other recovery allowed a taxpayer in accordance with RCW 82.32.060 as it now exists or as it may be amended.

3. If subsection (E)(2) of this section is held to be invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.060 existing at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.110 Late payment – Disregard of written instructions – Evasion – Penalties. 

A. If payment of any tax due on a return to be filed by a taxpayer is not received by the director by the due date, the director shall add a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(1), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

B. If the director determines that any tax has been substantially underpaid as defined in RCW 82.32.090(2), there shall be added a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(2), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

C. If a citation or criminal complaint is issued by the director for the collection of taxes, fees, assessments, interest or penalties, there shall be added thereto a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(3), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

D. If the director finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the director a license as required by Chapter 5.08 PTMC, the director shall impose a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(4), as it now exists or as it may be amended. No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection D if the person who has engaged in business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the director of the need to be licensed.

E. If the director determines that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from the taxpayer’s failure to follow specific written tax reporting instructions, there shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(5), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

F. If the director finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable, the director shall assess a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(6), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

G. The penalties imposed under subsections A through E of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.

H. The director shall not impose both the evasion penalty and the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions on the same tax found to be due.

I. For the purposes of this section, “return” means any document a person is required by the city of Port Townsend to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the city, and that has a statutorily defined due date.

J. If incorporation into the Port Townsend Municipal Code of future changes to RCW 82.32.090 is deemed invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.090 existing at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter is effective shall apply. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.120 Cancellation of penalties. 

A. The director may cancel any penalties imposed under PTMC 5.04B.110(A) if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Willful neglect is presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was, nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, unable to file or pay by the due date. The director has no authority to cancel any other penalties or to cancel penalties for any other reason except as provided in subsection C of this section.

B. A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the director within 30 days after the date the department mails the notice that the penalties are due. The request must be in writing and contain competent proof of all pertinent facts supporting a reasonable cause determination. In all cases the burden of proving the facts rests upon the taxpayer.

C. The director may cancel the penalties in PTMC 5.04B.110(A) one time if a person:

1. Is not currently licensed and filing returns;

2. Was unaware of its responsibility to file and pay tax; and

3. Obtained business licenses and filed past due tax returns within 30 days after being notified by the department.

D. The director shall not cancel any interest charged upon amounts due. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.130 Taxpayer quitting business – Liability of successor.

A. Whenever any taxpayer quits business, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of his business or his stock of goods, any tax payable hereunder shall become immediately due and payable. Such taxpayer shall, within 10 days thereafter, make a return and pay the tax due.

B. Any person who becomes a successor shall become liable for the full amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the city from the taxpayer until such time as: (1) the taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the city showing payment in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due, or (2) more than six months has passed since the successor notified the director of the acquisition and the director has not issued and notified the successor of an assessment.

C. Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the taxpayer.

D. Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the director of the acquisition, and the department does not within six months of the date it received the notice issue an assessment against the taxpayer and mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be liable for the tax. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.140 Administrative appeal. 

Any person, except one who has failed to comply with PTMC 5.04B.060, aggrieved by the amount of the fee or tax determined by the director to be required under the provisions of this chapter may pay the amount due and appeal from such determination by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within 30 days from the date written notice of such amount was mailed to the taxpayer. A $100.00 filing fee shall be submitted with the appeal, which filing fee is required to process the appeal. The appeal shall be heard, as soon as practical, by the hearing examiner, who shall fix a time and place for the hearing of such appeal, and shall cause a notice of the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the parties. The decision of the hearing examiner shall indicate the correct amount of the fee or tax owing. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.150 Judicial review of administrative appeal decision. 

The taxpayer or the city may obtain judicial review of the hearing examiner’s administrative decision by applying for a writ of review in the Jefferson County superior court within 15 days from the date of the hearing examiner’s decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in Chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable law, and court rules. The city shall have the same right of review from the administrative decision as does a taxpayer. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.160 Director to make rules.

The director shall have the power, from time to time, to adopt, publish and enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter or with law for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and it shall be unlawful to violate or fail to comply with any such rule or regulation. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).


5.04B.170 Ancillary allocation authority of director.

The director is authorized to enter into agreements with other Washington cities which impose an eligible gross receipts tax:

A. To conduct an audit or joint audit of a taxpayer by using an auditor employed by the city of Port Townsend, another city, or a contract auditor; provided, that such contract auditor’s pay is not in any way based upon the amount of tax assessed;

B. To allocate or apportion in a manner that fairly reflects the gross receipts earned from activities conducted within the respective cities the gross proceeds of sales, gross receipts, or gross income of the business, or taxes due from any person that is required to pay an eligible gross receipts tax to more than one Washington city;

C. To apply the city’s tax prospectively where a taxpayer has no office or place of business within the city and has paid tax on all gross income to another Washington city where the taxpayer is located; provided, that the other city maintains an eligible gross receipts tax, and the income was not derived from contracts with the city. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).

Any notice required by this chapter to be mailed to any taxpayer or licensee shall be sent by ordinary mail, addressed to the address of the taxpayer or licensee as shown by the records of the director.

5.04B.200 Public disclosure – Confidentiality – Information sharing. 

For purposes of this section, defined terms shall be as set forth in PTMC 5.04A.030 and 5.04B.020; in addition, unless a different meaning is clearly established by context, the following definitions also apply:

A. “Disclose” means to make known to any person in any manner whatever a return or tax information.

B. “Tax information” means:

1. A taxpayer’s identity;

2. The nature, source, or amount of the taxpayer’s income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemption, credits, assets, liability, net worth, tax liability deficiencies, over assessments, or tax payments, whether taken from the taxpayer’s books and records or any other source;

3. Whether the taxpayer’s return was, is being, or will be examined or subject to other investigation or processing; or

4. Other data received by, recorded by, prepared by, or provided to the director with respect to the determination of the existence, or possible existence, of liability, or the amount thereof, of a person under the city code for a tax, penalty, interest, fine, forfeiture, or other imposition, or offense. However, data, material, or documents that do not disclose information related to a specific or identifiable taxpayer do not constitute tax information under this section. Nothing in this chapter requires any person possessing data, material, or documents made confidential and privileged by this section to delete information from such data, material or documents so as to permit its disclosure.

5. “City agency” means every city office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or other city agency.

6. “Taxpayer identity” means the taxpayer’s name, address, telephone number, registration number, or any combination thereof, or any other information disclosing the identity of the taxpayer.

C. Returns and tax information are confidential and privileged, and except as authorized by this section, neither the director nor any other person may disclose any return or tax information.

D. This section does not prohibit the director from:

1. Disclosing such return or tax information in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or an administrative proceeding:

a. In respect of any tax imposed under city code if the taxpayer or its officer or other person liable under this title is a party in the proceeding; or

b. In which the taxpayer about whom such return or tax information is sought and another state agency are adverse parties in the proceeding;

2. Disclosing, subject to such requirements and conditions as the director prescribes by rules adopted pursuant to city code, such return or tax information regarding a taxpayer to such taxpayer or to such person or persons as that taxpayer may designate in a request for, or consent to, such disclosure, or to any other person, at the taxpayer’s request, to the extent necessary to comply with a request for information or assistance made by the taxpayer to such other person. However, tax information not received from the taxpayer must not be so disclosed if the director determines that such disclosure would compromise any investigation or litigation by any federal, state, or local government agency in connection with the civil or criminal liability of the taxpayer or another person, or that such disclosure would identify a confidential informant, or that such disclosure is contrary to any agreement entered into by the department that provides for the reciprocal exchange of information with other government agencies which agreement requires confidentiality with respect to such information unless such information is required to be disclosed to the taxpayer by the order of any court;

3. Publishing statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or reports or items thereof;

4. Disclosing such return or tax information, for official purposes only, to the mayor or city attorney, or to any city agency, or to any member of the city council or their authorized designees dealing with matters of taxation, revenue, trade, commerce, the control of industry or the professions;

7. Disclosing any such return or tax information to the proper officer of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States, the Canadian government or provincial governments of Canada, or to the proper officer of the tax department of any state or city or town or county, for official purposes, but only if the statutes of the United States, Canada or its provincial governments, or of such other state or city or town or county, as the case may be, grants substantially similar privileges to the proper officers of the city;

8. Disclosing any such return or tax information to the United States Department of Justice, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Defense, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Customs and Border Protection Agencies of the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States Coast Guard, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the United States Department of Treasury, and the United States Department of Transportation, or any authorized representative of these federal agencies or their successors, for official purposes;

9. Publishing or otherwise disclosing the text of a written determination designated by the director as a precedent pursuant to RCW 82.32.410;

E. 1. The director may disclose return or taxpayer information to a person under investigation or during any court or administrative proceeding against a person under investigation as provided in this subsection E. The disclosure must be in connection with the department’s official duties under this title, or a civil or criminal investigation. The disclosure may occur only when the person under investigation and the person in possession of data, materials, or documents are parties to the return or tax information to be disclosed. The department may disclose return or tax information such as invoices, contracts, bills, statements, resale or exemption certificates, or checks. However, the department may not disclose general ledgers, sales or cash receipt journals, check registers, accounts receivable/payable ledgers, general journals, financial statements, expert’s workpapers, income tax returns, state tax returns, tax return workpapers, or other similar data, materials, or documents.

2. Before disclosure of any tax return or tax information under this subsection E, the director must, through written correspondence, inform the person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed. The correspondence must clearly identify the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed. The director may not disclose any tax return or tax information under this subsection E until the time period allowed in subsection (E)(3) of this section has expired or until the court has ruled on any challenge brought under subsection (E)(3) of this section.

3. The person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed by the department has 20 days from the receipt of the written request required under subsection (E)(2) of this section to petition the superior court of the county in which the petitioner resides for injunctive relief. The court must limit or deny the request of the director if the court determines that:

a. The data, materials, or documents sought for disclosure are cumulative or duplicative, or are obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;

b. The production of the data, materials, or documents sought would be unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the department, the amount in controversy, limitations on the petitioner’s resources, and the importance of the issues at stake; or

c. The data, materials, or documents sought for disclosure contain trade secret information that, if disclosed, could harm the petitioner.

4. The director must reimburse reasonable expenses for the production of data, materials, or documents incurred by the person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed.

5. Requesting information under subsection (E)(2) of this section that may indicate that a taxpayer is under investigation does not constitute a disclosure of tax return or tax information under this section.

F. Service of a subpoena issued by the court or under applicable city code does not constitute a disclosure of a return or tax information under this section. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this section, a person served with a subpoena issued by the court or under applicable city code may disclose the existence or content of the subpoena to that person’s legal counsel.

G. Any person acquiring knowledge of any return or tax information in the course of his or her employment with the city and any person acquiring knowledge of any return or tax information as provided under subsection (D)(4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) or (11) of this section, who discloses any such return or tax information to another person not entitled to knowledge of such return or tax information under the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. If the person guilty of such violation is an officer or employee of the city, such person must forfeit such office or employment and is incapable of holding any public office or employment in this city for a period of two years thereafter.

5.04B.210 Tax constitutes debt.

Any license fee or tax due and unpaid under this chapter, and all interest and penalties thereon, shall constitute a debt to the city of Port Townsend and may be collected in the same manner as any other debt in like amount, which remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies. (Ord. 3242 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 2960 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2883 § 1, 2004).

In addition, the city finance director may deny any application for a business license where the applicant is not in compliance with all other city ordinances or state statutes, as now or later amended.

B. Other Reasons for Denial. In addition, if, after investigation, the city finance director finds that the applicant has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or other crime which relates to the activity for which the license is sought or finds good reason to believe that issuance of a license to the applicant would be otherwise adverse to or unreasonably jeopardize the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the city of Port Townsend, the city finance director may deny the application. The city finance director shall, upon denial, inform the applicant in writing of the reason for denial, citing any applicable ordinance or statute violated; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing any duty or obligation on the city to conduct an investigation prior to granting a business license under this chapter. (Ord. 3043 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3040 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2460 § 1, 1995).

In any area of the city in which telephone, electric power wires and cables have been placed underground, or in any area where the city requires above ground telephone, electric power and cables to be placed underground, a franchisee may not erect poles or run or suspend wires, cables or other conductors thereon, but must lay or move such wires, cables or conductors underground in the manner required by the city at a franchisee’s sole cost. If an ordinance is passed creating a local improvement district which involves placing underground certain utilities including that of a franchisee which are then located overhead on poles and suspended wires, a franchisee shall remove poles, cables and wires from the surface of the streets within such district and shall place the same underground in conformity with the requirements of the public works director. When property owners pay the costs of placing facilities underground by the local improvement district method or otherwise, franchisee shall share pro rata in such funding.

D. Pole Installation and Attachment – Joint Use. All poles, cables, wires, antennae, conduits or appurtenances shall be constructed and erected in a neat, workmanlike manner and shall be at a height and position as approved by the public works director. A franchisee erecting or maintaining poles shall allow anyone constructing under the authority of this master ordinance and the city, joint use of its poles upon payment of a reasonable proportion of the cost of such poles installed and shall obey any order issued by the public works director relative to the joint use of poles.

E. Building Moving. Whenever a person obtains city permission to use any street for the purpose of moving any building, a franchisee, upon 14 days’ written notice from the city, shall raise or remove, at the expense of the person moving the building, any of a franchisee’s cable which may obstruct the removal of such building in accordance with regulations and general city ordinances. Where more than one street is available for the moving of such building, the building shall be moved on the street that causes the least interference, as determined by the public works director.

F. Location of Facilities. A franchisee shall provide the city with maps which show the horizontal location of its facilities within the city limits. When so directed by the city, a franchisee shall submit plans on a digital geographical information system (GIS) and on a computer based format compatible with AutoCAD. In addition, a franchisee shall consult with the public works department to specify the vertical location of its facilities within city limits, in a manner and format agreed to by the city and the franchisee. Future projects shall be coordinated with the city’s capital facilities plan (CFP).

G. Relocation of Facilities. A franchisee shall, unless an emergency arises, upon 60 days’ notice, at its own cost and expense, move any underground, surface or overhead construction which interferes with any local improvement district work or with any construction for public purposes authorized or ordered by the city. When the cost of such relocation is paid by property owners through a local improvement district or otherwise, franchisee shall share in this compensation on a pro rata basis.

H. Abandonment of Facilities. A franchisee accepting a franchise under the terms of this master ordinance for the installation of ducts, utility tunnels, vaults, maintenance holes, poles, wires or any other appurtenances shall remove such installation when it is no longer required or used as ordered by the public works director. A franchisee agrees to notify the public works director immediately upon any abandonment of facilities.

I. Tree Trimming. Upon approval of the public works director, a franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging streets, public ways and public places in the franchise area so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with a franchisee’s wires and cables. A franchisee shall be responsible for debris removal from such activities, and transport, where possible, to the city compost facility. It is understood that, for the most part, a cable franchisee uses existing poles and does not engage in extensive tree trimming. However, to the extent that it does engage in tree trimming, a franchisee shall:

1. Provide the public works director with a plan of actual work areas including a map and scheduled dates before any work is done;

2. Refrain from applying herbicides or pesticides to trees or shrubs unless the application is first approved by the public works director and is consistent with city policy;

3. Designate a contact person to be available for citizen inquiry and information and to follow-up to review problems or concerns with the public works department;

4. Maintain a file for all customer contacts regarding tree trimming; and

5. Continue an outgoing cooperative effort with the city with regards to present and future maintenance work, including a cooperative replanting plan as necessary; provided, however, that nothing in this section prevents a franchisee from taking immediate action when an emergency exists and the vegetation poses a threat to the public health and safety or its facilities.

J. Dangerous Conditions – Authority of City to Abate. Whenever a franchisee’s construction, installation or excavation of facilities authorized by this master ordinance has caused or contributed to a condition that appears to substantially impair the lateral support of the adjoining street or public places, streets, utilities or city property, or endangers the public, the public works director in his/her sole judgement may direct a franchisee, at its own expense, to take actions to protect the public, adjacent public places, city property or street utilities, and such action may include compliance within a prescribed time.

In the event that a franchisee fails or refuses to promptly take the actions directed by the city, or fails to fully comply with such directions, or if emergency conditions exist which require immediate action, the city may enter upon the property and take such actions as are necessary to protect the public, the adjacent streets, or street utilities, or to maintain the lateral support thereof, or actions regarded as necessary safety precautions, and a franchisee shall be liable to the city for the costs thereof.

K. Restoration of Streets. After construction, installation, maintenance or repair of the facilities authorized by this master ordinance or any permit obtained by virtue of a franchise granted under this master ordinance, a franchisee shall leave all streets, avenues, highways or public places in as good and safe condition in all respects as they were before the commencement of such work by a franchisee and in accordance with all city ordinances, regulations and street standards. The public works director shall have final approval of the condition of such streets and public places after completion of construction. A franchisee’s responsibility under this section shall extend for 12 months after completion of construction, installation, maintenance or repair of such facilities for inadequate restoration of streets that was not apparent at the time of any such final approval.

L. Reimbursement. Franchisee shall reimburse the city for all actual administrative expenses incurred by the city that are directly related to receiving and approving a permit or license and to inspect plans and construction. Where the city incurs actual administrative expenses for review or inspection of activities undertaken through the authority granted in this master ordinance, franchisee shall pay such expenses directly to the city.

M. Underground Utilities Council. A franchisee shall be a member of and operate within the policies established by both the Jefferson County underground utility coordinating council and the statewide One Call Underground Utility Locate Center. (Ord. 2811 § 3, 2002; Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).

B. Schedule of Rates – Notice of Any Change. Within 30 days after the grant of any franchise hereunder a franchisee shall file with the city a complete schedule of all rates to be charged to customers. Prior to implementation of any change in rates or charges for any service or equipment provided by a franchisee, a franchisee shall provide to the city and all customers a minimum of 30 days’ written notice of the new schedule of rates to be charged. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).


5.14.150 Nondiscrimination.

A franchisee shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules, regulations or in any other respect, make or grant any preferences or advantage to any person nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage; provided, that nothing in this master ordinance shall be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules including discounts to senior citizens and disabled persons of low income to which any customer coming within such classification would be entitled; and provided further, that connection and/or service charges may be waived or modified during promotional campaigns of a franchisee. A franchisee will not deny access to cable communications service to any group of potential residential customers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which the group resides. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).


5.14.160 Equalization of civic contributions.

A. Payment of Propositional Franchising Costs. In the event of one or more franchises being granted the city may require that such subsequential franchisees pay to the city an amount proportionally equal to franchising costs contributed by the initial franchisee. These costs may include but are not limited to such features as PEG access equipment and facilities, contributions to any PEG access fund, institutional network costs, and bi-directional or equivalent cable installed to municipal buildings or institutions and similar expenses. On the anniversary of the grant of each later awarded franchise, such franchisees shall pay to the city an amount proportional to the amount contributed by the original franchisee, based upon the amount of customers held by such franchisees.

B. Provision of PEG Access Channels and Emergency Override System. Additional franchisees shall provide all PEG access channel(s) and the emergency override system currently available to the customers of existing franchisees. In order to provide these access channels, additional franchisees may be required to interconnect, at their cost, with existing franchisees cable systems, subject to any reasonable terms and conditions that the existing franchisee providing the interconnection may require. These interconnection agreements shall be made directly between the franchisees. The city council, in such cases of dispute regarding costs, may be called upon to arbitrate regarding these arrangements. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).


5.14.170 Subordinate to city and prior lawful occupancy.

Any privilege claimed under any such franchise by a franchisee in a street or other public property shall be subordinate to the city’s police powers and to any prior occupancy of the streets or other public property. In addition to the inherent powers of the city to regulate and control any franchise the city issues, the authority granted to it by the Act, and those powers expressly reserved by the city, or agreed to and provided for in a franchise, the right and power is reserved to the city to promulgate such additional regulations of general applicability as it may find necessary in the exercise of its powers. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).


5.14.180 No recourse against the city for loss or expense.

A franchisee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense or damages arising out of the issuance of a franchise under this master ordinance or because of the city’s related enforcement actions. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).


5.14.190 Subsequent action by state or federal agencies.

If any subsequent federal, state or local law, ordinance or regulation shall require or permit a franchisee to perform any act which may be in conflict with the terms of this master ordinance, or shall prohibit a franchisee from performing any act in conformance with the terms of this master ordinance, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, a franchisee shall so notify the city. If the city council determines that a material provision of this master ordinance is affected by such changed or new law, ordinance or regulation, the city and a franchisee shall enter into good faith negotiations to modify this master ordinance to conform with such changed requirements. Failure to complete these negotiations to the satisfaction of both parties within a reasonable time shall constitute a material breach of the franchise, but in no event shall a period of less than 180 days be deemed unreasonable pursuant to this section. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).


5.14.200 Cable system evaluation.

In addition to periodic meetings, the city may require reasonable evaluation sessions at any time during the term of a franchise. It is intended that such evaluations cover areas such as customer service, response to the community’s cable-related needs, and a franchisee’s performance under and compliance with the terms of a franchise. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).


5.14.210 Record inspection.

Subject to statutory and constitutional limits and two working days’ advance notice, the city reserves the right to inspect the records of a franchisee necessary for the enforcement of a franchise and verification of the accuracy of franchise fee payments at any time during normal business hours; provided, that the city shall maintain the confidentiality of any trade secrets or other proprietary information in the possession of a franchisee. Such documents shall include such information as financial records, customer records within the context of Section 631 of the Act, and plans pertaining to a franchisee’s operation in the city.

The city may elect, in lieu of the above and without any prejudice to any of its other legal rights and remedies, to obtain an order from the superior court having jurisdiction compelling a franchisee to comply with the provisions of the franchise and recover damages and costs incurred by the city by reason of a franchisee’s failure to comply. (Ord. 2537 § 1, 1996).

In addition to any other remedy provided herein, the city reserves the right to pursue any lawful remedy to compel or force a franchisee and/or its successors and assigns to comply with the terms hereof, and the pursuit of any right or remedy by the city shall not prevent the city from thereafter initiating the termination or revocation procedures established in this master ordinance.

“Cable operator” means any person or group of persons: 

1. Who provides cable service over a cable system and directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such cable system; or 

2. Who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any arrangement, the management and operation of such a cable system. 

In this chapter, Summit Communications, Inc., and all other cable television franchise holders operating in the city in the future, shall be collectively referred to as “the cable operator,” unless specifically stated otherwise. (Ord. 2378 § 1, 1993). 


5.15.040 Initial review of basic cable rates.

A. Notice. Upon the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter and the certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify the cable operator by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and charges as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 

B. Cable Operator Response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the city, the cable operator shall file with the city its current rates for basic service and charges and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates, in accordance with the FCC rate regulations. 

C. Expedited Determination and Public Hearing. 

1. Unless it elects to proceed under subsection D of this section, the city shall hold a public hearing within 30 days of the city’s receipt of the request for rate review of basic service and charges, at which interested persons may testify and/or shall allow interested persons to submit written comments to the city clerk-treasurer prior to the scheduled hearing. 

2. Public notice of the hearing will be given by advertisement once in the official newspaper of the city. The city may give notice of the public hearing on the basic service rates and charges prior to actual receipt of the cable operator’s rate schedule in order to meet the 30-day deadline of subsection C.1 of this section. 

3. If the city council takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic service rates and charges with the city, and has not availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days permitted in subsection D of this section, the proposed rates will continue in effect.

D. Extended Review Period. 

1. If the city council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic service rates and charges with the city, issue a brief order notifying the cable operator that it is invoking the following additional periods of time to make a final determination: 

a. Ninety days if the city council needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or 

b. One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 

2. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing, at which interested persons may express their views by testifying at the hearing, or by submitting written comments to the city clerk-treasurer prior to the scheduled hearing. Public notice of the hearing will be given by advertisement once in the official newspaper of the city. 

3. If the city council has taken no action within the 90-day or 150-day period, then the proposed rates will go into effect, or existing rates will remain in effect, subject to refunds in accordance with the FCC rate regulations if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates. To preserve its right to make a subsequent decision ordering refunds, the city must issue a brief written order by the expiration of the 90-day or 150-day period directing the cable operator to keep records of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rates and the identity of the subscriber accounts on whose behalf such amounts were paid.

E. Benchmark Analysis. If the cable operator submits its current basic service rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, the city council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council’s findings, the initial basic service rates and charges shall be established in accordance with the FCC rate regulations. 

F. Cost-of-Service Showings. If the cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, it shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic service rate above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. The city council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review, and may approve initial basic service rates above the benchmark or prescribe new basic service rates in accordance with the FCC regulations. 

G. Decision. 

1. After completion of its review of the cable operator’s proposed rates, the city council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution, with reasons stated, if it:

b. Prescribe a reasonable rate; 

c. Order a rate refund; or 

d. Impose fines or monetary forfeitures as permitted under state or local law.

A. Notice. A cable operator who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service or associated equipment shall file a request with the city and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect.

5.15.060 Automatic rate adjustments.

5.92.010 Purpose.

It is the intended purpose of this chapter to recognize the importance and benefits of freedom of expression to a democratic society. Experience has shown, however, that adult entertainment facilities, as defined herein, are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. Adult entertainment facilities are historically linked with organized crime, prostitution, narcotics, and other unlawful and criminal activity. These activities often lead to the development of public nuisances, including moral nuisances. Therefore, the licensing and operation of adult entertainment facilities should be regulated and monitored through the system of licensing and operating regulations contained in this chapter. (Ord. 2917 § 2, 2006).


5.92.020 Scope.

This chapter governs the licensing and operation of all adult entertainment facilities within the city. The location and siting of adult entertainment facilities is governed by the zoning regulations contained in PTMC Title 17. All adult entertainment facilities shall satisfy the requirements of both this chapter and PTMC Title 17. (Ord. 2917 § 2, 2006).

2. Any dog bite report filed with the shelter or city; or 

3. Actions of the dog witnessed by any animal control officer or law enforcement officer; or 

4. Other substantial evidence.

1. Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant owner;

2. Type, name, age, color, sex, and distinguishing characteristics of the dog;

F. Noncompliance. In the event the owner of a dangerous dog fails to comply with the requirements of this section or RCW 16.08.080, the animal control authority may take immediate action to confiscate the dog pursuant to RCW 16.08.100.

The certificate of registration shall contain its expiration date, and a statement of the applicable criminal penalties. The certificate of registration shall be prominently displayed by the owner of the dangerous dog in an appropriate location, as determined by the animal control authority.

H. Annual Inspections.

Chapter 9.09 NOISE

Sections: 

9.09.010    Declaration of policy.

9.09.015    Noise violation.

9.09.020    Washington Administrative Code adopted.

9.09.030    Public disturbance noise prohibited.

9.09.040    Exemptions and special provisions.

9.09.045    Variances.

9.09.050    Enforcement.

9.09.060    Penalty.

9.09.070    Clerk to maintain copy of adopted statute and regulation.

9.09.080    Public nuisance.


9.09.010 Declaration of policy. 

A. The city council of the city of Port Townsend finds that noise can unreasonably disturb and interfere with the peace and quiet of citizens and visitors, and that it is appropriate and reasonable to balance the rights of citizens who are disturbed by excessive noise with the rights of citizens to free expression and to be free from unreasonable governmental regulation. It is the policy of the city to minimize the exposure of citizens to excessive levels of noise, and to promote and preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare. The regulation of noise in this chapter is based on proscribing only conduct that unreasonably disturbs or interferes with the peace, comfort and repose of others.

B. The intent of the city council is to regulate the level of noise in a manner that promotes commerce, the use, value and enjoyment of property, sleep, repose, and the quality of the environment, recognizing that expression associated with sounds must be protected so long as the manner of expression does not unreasonably interfere with the peace, comfort and repose of others. 

C. In particular, the city’s historic commercial district is associated with uses and places where music is an important aspect of the district. Such music should reasonably be accommodated, and the intent of this chapter is to place reasonable hour limitations on the playing of music so as to protect against excessive noise that disturbs sleep and that do not unduly burden the playing of music in the historic commercial district.

D. While some cities have based noise regulation on decibel-based measures only, the city council believes that public disturbance noise regulations provides an additional reasonable measure to address excessive noise. As stated by the Washington Court of Appeals in Everett v. O’Brien, 31 Wn. App. 319, 641 P. 2d 714 (1982) (upholding Everett’s ordinance proscribing noise which “unreasonably disturb(s) or interfere(s) with the peace, comfort and repose of owners or possessors of real property”): “Requiring a police officer to promptly appear with a sound-metering device whenever a noise complaint is filed unreasonably restricts the City’s ability to control the level of noise in the community.” Also, as stated by the Court in Everett v. O’Brien: “A person of ordinary understanding is capable of determining when noise from his motorcycle is unreasonably disturbing the peace, comfort, and repose of others. This standard is more helpful than decibel levels to the average citizen in determining whether or not conduct is unlawful.” To the same effect is the Court of Appeals statement in Holland v. City of Tacoma, 90 Wn. App. 533, 954 P. 2d 290 (1998) (upholding against constitutional challenge Tacoma’s ordinance which prohibited the playing of car sound systems at a volume that would be “audible” at a distance greater than 50 feet): “This ordinance has clear guidelines. A person of ordinary intelligence knows what it means for sound to be ‘audible’ at more than 50 feet.” 

E. With the exception of sound from motor vehicle sound systems audible at a distance greater than 50 feet, the intent of this chapter is to require notice to the person making or responsible for allowing public disturbance noise or noise in violation of decibel levels warning that continued making of such noise is unlawful, and violations of noise regulations in this chapter should occur only when a person intentionally refuses to cease the disturbing noise after having been requested to do so by a law enforcement officer. (Ord. 2831 § 1, 2003).


9.09.015 Noise violation.

A noise violation can occur based either on creating noise in excess of the limits established by Chapter 173-60 WAC, Maximum Environmental Noise Levels, as adopted by this chapter, or creating a “public disturbance noise” as defined in this chapter. (Ord. 2831 § 1, 2003).

B. The following sections, subsections, and portions of Chapter 173-60 WAC are adopted as modified by the following:

F. “Chapter” refers to the chapter created by this noise ordinance.

G. One copy of Chapter 173-60 WAC, Maximum Environmental Noise Levels, shall be kept by the city clerk on file for use and examination by members of the public. (Ord. 2831 § 1, 2003).

3. Loud and frequent, repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds made by the human voice or voices.

4. The creation of loud and frequent, repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds, including temporary projects for the maintenance of or repair of homes, grounds, and including but not limited to sounds from lawnmowers, powered hand tools, snow removal equipment and composters, which emanate from any building, structure or property within a residential district established pursuant to the city of Port Townsend zoning code. 

5. The creation of loud and frequent, repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds made by the use of a musical instrument, sound amplifier, or other device or combination of devices, capable of producing or reproducing sound. 

6. The creation of loud and frequent, repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds from any sound system, such as radios, compact disc players, or tape players.

7. The use of a sound amplifier or other device capable of producing or reproducing amplified sound upon public streets for the purpose of commercial advertising, sales, or attracting the attention of the public to any person, group of persons, vehicle, structure, or property, except as permitted by law. 

8. The frequent, repetitive or intermittently continuous sounds made by any animal, owned by or in the possession of a person, including but not limited to, barking, howling, yelping, or whining. Animal noise defined in this section is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and is subject to abatement procedures, seizure and impoundment, as prescribed by law. 

9. Frequent or repetitive sounding of false car alarm.

D. Noise from Moving Vehicle. The playing, using, operating or permitting to be played or used or operated of any sound system from a moving motor vehicle, such as radios, compact disc players, or tape players, operated at a volume as to be audible at distances greater than 50 feet from the location of the vehicle is a “public disturbance noise.” The 50-foot requirement does not apply to a motor vehicle that is standing or stopped.

The intent of this section is that it is a violation of this chapter regulating noise if a sound system from a moving vehicle is audible at a distance of 50 feet. As provided by PTMC 9.09.050(B), Enforcement, it is not required that a citizen complaint be made concerning the noise and from a moving vehicle the police officer is not required to give a written warning before a citation is issued. The reason to allow the police to take prompt action concerning a moving vehicle is precisely because the vehicle is moving and prompt action is necessary to alleviate the situation. By the time a citizen makes a complaint, the vehicle has moved on somewhere else. 

The last sentence of this section means that it is a violation of the noise ordinance for a nonmoving vehicle (one that is standing or parked) to make loud noise, without reference to whether it is audible for a distance of 50 feet. The operator of a vehicle that is stopped or standing can only receive a citation if a citizen first complains, and the operator does not cease the noise after a written warning from a police officer. A parked vehicle is like any other noise source. There must first be a citizen complaint and a written warning before a citation issues. Also, it wouldn’t make sense to allow a vehicle to be parked outside a house or business at a distance less than 50 feet and generate loud noise that unreasonably offends the property owner. In that situation, the property owner could complain and the police could respond and give the car operator a warning. (Ord. 2831 § 1, 2003).

After that time, the noise ordinance will be enforced only if the city-port MOA is terminated. 

A copy of the city-port MOA shall be available for public viewing or copying during business hours at the city clerk’s office and the Port of Port Townsend administrative office. (Ord. 3035 § 1, 2010; Ord. 2831 § 1, 2003).

3. The activity is otherwise sufficiently regulated in other chapters of the Port Townsend Municipal Code; 

4. In the judgment of the city manager, the public will derive substantial benefits from the activity, such as tourism promotion, or the promotion of economic development, and in the balance, the activity will have nominal impacts upon public health and welfare; or 

5. Special circumstances rendering compliance unreasonable in light of economic or physical factors, encroachment upon an existing noise source, or because of nonavailability of feasible technology or control methods.

C. The city manager may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, and may condition issuance of a variance on an agreement setting forth conditions, safeguards and assurances. 

D. No variance shall be issued for a period longer than 30 days except upon due notice to the public with opportunity to comment. Public hearings may be held, when substantial public interest is shown, in the discretion of the manager. (Ord. 2831 § 1, 2003).


9.09.050 Enforcement.

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, before any notice of infraction, or arrest/criminal citation or criminal complaint shall be issued or occur:

1. A law enforcement officer shall have received a citizen’s complaint, which may be oral or written.

2. A law enforcement officer shall issue a warning notice advising the person making or causing a noise violation, or person owning or in possession of property who knowingly allows a noise violation to originate from the property, to cease the noise violation, and that failure to comply is a violation of this chapter and subjects the person to notice of infraction or arrest/criminal citation. 

A person who has been advised as provided in this section, and thereafter within a 24-hour period causes or makes a noise violation, need not be advised a second time to cease, and may be issued a notice of infraction or be subject to arrest/criminal citation or complaint for making or allowing a noise violation. A person who, within a 24-hour period, has been issued a notice of infraction or was arrested or issued a criminal citation or complaint for making or allowing a noise violation, need not be given another warning that they are in violation of this chapter before being issued a notice of infraction or becoming subject to arrest or issuance of a criminal citation or complaint for making or allowing a noise violation. A person who has been advised as provided in this section three or more times within a 12-month time period need not be given another warning that they are in violation of this chapter before being issued a notice of infraction.

B. The enforcement procedures in this section do not apply to the following: 

The playing, using, operating or permitting to be played or used or operated of any sound system from a motor vehicle, such as radios, compact disc players, or tape players, operated at a volume as to be audible at distances greater than 50 feet from the location of the vehicle (prohibited by PTMC 9.09.030(D)).

The court may direct any person who has received a notice of infraction or citation/complaint to participate in voluntary resolution of the matter causing the notice of infraction or citation/complaint to be issued, through the procedures provided in Chapter 2.82 PTMC, Dispute Resolution Program. If the court determines voluntary resolution has occurred, then the court shall take that into account in determining a proper order, and the court may waive, reduce, or suspend any finding or monetary penalty based on voluntary resolution.

A separate violation exists if, after a person is issued a citation, a person continues, renews, resumes, or makes or allows a noise violation, notwithstanding the second noise violation is within the same day, or arises from the same type of conduct that caused the first citation to issue. 

B. Where a person has been found to have committed the same offense in violation of this chapter three or more times in a one-year period, a subsequent charge brought within one year of the last adjudication constitutes a misdemeanor punishable, as provided by PTMC 9.02.130, by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment in a jail for not more than 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 

C. Any person charged with a civil infraction under the provisions of this chapter shall respond to the notice of infraction in the manner set forth in Chapter 7.80 RCW, which is adopted for the city.

Section 2. Temporary applicability; Citizen work group to be formed.

The city council directs the city manager to review Chapter 9.24 PTMC and consider further amendments to Chapter 9.24 PTMC, with the assistance of a citizen task force appointed in accordance with the city council rules of procedure. The city council intends that such amendments will establish appropriate exemptions, clarify administrative processes, and establish appropriate regulatory requirements to address public health and safety impacts associated with large gatherings or assemblies, while recognizing that Port Townsend is a preferred destination for conventions, reunions, arts festivals, and other events which draw substantial numbers of tourists and visitors to Port Townsend. The city council directs the city manager to report his recommendations to the city council at such time as the task force has completed its deliberations, and as staff resources enable full consideration of appropriate amendments.

Unless waived by the city manager, a minimum of three such personnel shall be provided for any event coming within the provisions of this chapter.

It shall be the duty of the applicant to record the number of persons admitted to and exited from any event coming within the provisions of this chapter in such a manner that the number of persons present can be reasonably known at any time. Failure to provide a reasonably accurate record of the number of persons present shall give public law enforcement personnel the right to reasonably estimate the number present. Should the number of persons present at any time exceed by 20 percent or more the number for which the permit was granted, it shall be the right and the duty of the public law enforcement agencies to prohibit further access to the event until such time as the number in attendance allows for compliance with the permit.

Chapter 9.46 RIGHT-OF-WAY USE RULES INCLUDING STREETS AND SIDEWALKS

Sections:

9.46.010    Purpose.

9.46.020    Definitions.

9.46.030    Rules of conduct.

9.46.040    Administrative regulations.

9.46.050    Variance.

9.46.060    Interpretation.

9.46.070    Enforcement – Violations.


9.46.010 Purpose.

A. The city council determines it appropriate to set reasonable time, place and manner restrictions, which are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication, and which are content and viewpoint neutral, for use of streets, sidewalks, alleyways and other public places in order to accommodate and balance a variety of public interests, including protected speech and expression.

B. The city council recognizes the value of expressive activities including speech and music to a vibrant and diverse outdoor life, particularly for the downtown area. These rules are not intended to prohibit such expressive activities and in no way seek to regulate content of expression or the viewpoint of the speaker or presenter. Rather, the rules are intended to allow free speech and expressive activities subject to reasonable time, place and manner restrictions, so that a variety of public interests including free speech activities are accommodated.

C. In addition to accommodating expressive activity, these rules and regulations are designed and intended to accommodate these important public interests: (1) maintaining the use of sidewalks for reasonably unimpeded, safe and efficient travel and transportation, and incidental authorized uses (for example, sidewalk vending, and sidewalk cafes), and other public purposes (events, parade, etc.), and maintaining streets for pedestrian and vehicular traffic; (2) maintaining the use of sidewalks and streets for safe, efficient and reasonably unimpeded travel and transportation by persons who are infirm, elderly or disabled and to accommodate transportation assistance devices such as wheelchairs, walkers, and crutches; (3) protecting the city’s investment in infrastructure designed to promote tourism; (4) respecting the rights of owners and occupants of adjoining properties to light, air, access and view; (5) assisting cleaning and maintenance of the right-of-way; (6) providing for safe and prompt access to utilities and related equipment located in or under rights-of-way; (7) preserving the safety and aesthetic appearance of public places as inviting areas for pedestrians; and (8) providing an opportunity for a diversity of activities, views, or opinions. Limits, including the limits in this chapter, assist in ensuring that public space is freely available to all, including others who may wish to exercise free speech rights. These limits are especially important in the civic district given its unique public aspect in the city.

D. Over the years, the city has engaged in planning efforts and capital projects. Recent projects include investment in the downtown streetscape and Taylor Street improvements which are in part designed to make the area safe and inviting for pedestrians, encourage downtown business activity and encourage tourism. Setting reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on protected speech and expression helps protect this investment in infrastructure and preserve the use of sidewalks for reasonably unimpeded, safe and efficient pedestrian traffic, including for tourists, while at the same time accommodating protected speech.

E. Over the last couple of years, a number of citizens have complained that certain free speech use of the sidewalks in the downtown area is so extensive and intrusive that it interferes with access to Pope Marine Park or has the effect of obstructing substantial portions of the sidewalk. One person in particular displays large and intrusive whiteboards with various messages. These displays run for at least 80 to 100 feet on the sidewalk and substantially interfere with free, open and safe travel by pedestrians and others with disabilities and those using strollers or other accessories. The complaints (with one or two exceptions) do not object to the content of these messages. The complaints have been both written and verbal. Last fall, out of concern that this type of use could create a safety issue if it occurred during the Wooden Boat Festival and the Arts and Crafts Fair, the council adopted temporary regulations prohibiting placing any obstruction on the sidewalk (free speech, vending cart or otherwise) in the “event zone” (area in the immediate vicinity of the festivals).

F. Without reasonable limits, such activities effectively and unreasonably take over substantial portions of sidewalks and substantially interfere with pedestrian use. Such activities can create safety issues for the public, particularly during major tourist events such as the Wooden Boat Festival and the Arts and Crafts Fair which can draw tens of thousands of people to a small area of the city at any one time.

G. Having rules in place serves the important function of providing clear standards for what activities can take place and under what conditions so that users may know in advance of any activity that is allowed.

H. These rules provide the opportunity to anyone to obtain an administrative interpretation of these rules if a user is unclear of the standards and requirements and wishes to obtain an interpretation in advance of engaging in any conduct.

I. These rules also provide an opportunity to seek a variance from the application of the rules if the user believes their application causes unnecessary hardship or interference with a person’s ability to communicate protected speech.

J. These rules build on and supplement – but do not replace – other rules and regulations that allow specified activity in public areas. For example, certain commercial activities on sidewalks, such as sidewalk cafes and vending machines, are subject to the requirements of a street use permit (Chapter 12.10 PTMC). Special events occurring within public rights-of-way are subject to the requirements of a special event permit (Chapter 17.60 PTMC). Assemblies occurring within public rights-of-way are subject to the requirements of assembly regulations (Chapter 9.24 PTMC). Sales on streets and sidewalks are subject to Chapter 5.32 PTMC. Activities in public or private areas are also subject to the city’s noise ordinance (Chapter 9.09 PTMC). Activities in public or private areas can constitute public nuisances under the city’s nuisance code (Chapters 9.08 and 9.10 PTMC). Activities can be subject to traffic and criminal codes, for example, RCW 9A.84.030(1)(c), which makes intentional obstruction of vehicular or pedestrian traffic without lawful authority a misdemeanor.

K. These rules are also necessary to ensure that persons with disabilities have safe and unimpeded access to public streets and sidewalks and to comply with state and federal disabilities laws. As proposed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (“Access Board”), a continuous clear width of pedestrian access routes (exclusive of the width of the curb) must be four feet minimum to accommodate persons with disabilities. (Proposed “Accessibility Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way,” published in the Federal Register on July 26, 2011, 36 CFR Part 1190, Docket No. ATBCB 2011-04.)

L. These rules define the legislative balance of placing reasonable limits on protected speech but allowing ample opportunity for persons to engage in protected speech.

M. These rules are designed to protect the public health, safety, welfare and economic prosperity of the city of Port Townsend.

N. Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be, or shall be, construed to create a duty to enforce this chapter or to form the basis for liability on the part of the city of Port Townsend or its officers, employees, or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of any person to comply with this chapter. No provision of this chapter is intended to impose any duty upon the city or any of its officers or employees, which would subject them to damage in a civil action. (Ord. 3107 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3091 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


9.46.020 Definitions.

A. “Busking” means to play music or otherwise perform for voluntary donations on a public space (for example, right-of-way, sidewalk, or park).

B. “Protected speech” means verbal or written communications intended to convey a noncommercial political, religious, philosophical or other similar message to the public, and includes distributing literature, seeking petition signatures, picketing, demonstrating, carrying or displaying signs, billboards, posters and similar messaging, artistic performance, or other activities recognized by the courts as entitled to protection under federal or Washington constitutions.

C. “Public space” means any part of the city of Port Townsend that is not privately owned and that is controlled, managed or operated by the city and available for use by the public, such as (but without limitation) streets, sidewalks, alleyways, rights-of-way, parks, city buildings or properties.

D. “Use” means the exercise of dominion or control over or occupation of all or part of a public space. It includes construction, storing, erecting, placing upon, maintaining, or operating any inanimate thing or object in, upon, over, or under any public space. “Use” includes the placement of a table, equipment, placard, display or other similar object. “Use” does not include the placement of an inanimate object in such a location and for such a limited duration of time that, under the circumstances, no reasonable persons could conclude that the public’s right to use or enjoy the public space, in whole or in part, had been or potentially could have been interfered with. For example, a person temporarily setting a purse or other item on the sidewalk is not “using” the sidewalk as defined in this section. “Use” includes busking if the busker places objects on the public space (for example, guitar case) and leaves it there in a manner that meets the definition of “use” above.

“Use” does not include a person who, without placing things on the sidewalk, is leafleting, signature gathering, busking, or carrying stick-mounted signs. The person is still subject to the general rules of conduct in PTMC 9.46.030(A), but the person is not limited by the area limitations in PTMC 9.46.030(B). (Ord. 3107 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3091 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


9.46.030 Rules of conduct.

The following rules of conduct apply to any person using (as “use” is defined in PTMC 9.46.020(D)) the public rights-of-way and public spaces including streets and sidewalks for protected speech activity, and permission is allowed subject to these rules. They apply to any person, including those engaged in any of the following activities: leafleting and signature gathering, busking, carrying stick-mounted signs, and using tables, signs, posters, billboard or similar messaging, or other structures for free speech activity.

A. General Rules. This section applies to all persons who engage in protected speech activity on the public rights-of-way and public spaces including streets and sidewalks.

1. No person shall treat any person in an aggressive, menacing, threatening or abusive manner that would place a reasonable person in fear for their property or personal safety.

2. Leafleting and signature gathering, busking, carrying stick-mounted signs, using tables, signs or other structures for free speech activity, and similar free speech activities shall be done in a manner that does not substantially or unduly block the free and unimpeded use of the sidewalk or streets for pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including those with disabilities, or access to building entrances, or that poses a safety hazard.

3. A person wishing to carry signs must ensure that the sign meets the following requirements:

a. No sign may be larger than four square feet, and not be wider than 30 inches.

b. A sign may be attached to a stake which is no more than eight feet in length.

c. Signs may only be constructed of lightweight materials such as cloth, paper, cardboard or plastic (but not including metal).

4. No person shall make use of a loudspeaker or megaphone or other electronic sound-amplification device, or lighting device, without prior approval.

5. The person engaged in the activity is responsible for any injuries and/or damages to persons or property from the activity. The city shall have no liability for the activity.

B. Area Limitations. This section applies to all persons using (as “use” is defined in PTMC 9.46.020(D)) the public rights-of-way and public spaces, including streets and sidewalks, for protected speech activity. As defined in PTMC 9.46.020(D)), “use” includes the placing of objects on the sidewalk in connection with protected speech activity. “Use” does not include, and these area limitations do not apply to, persons who, without placing things on the sidewalk, are leafleting, signature gathering, busking, or carrying stick-mounted signs. Such activity is not restricted as to location (except by the general rules in subsection A of this section).

1. A person wishing to occupy or use (as “use” is defined in PTMC 9.46.020(D)) the sidewalk or other right-of-way for protected speech activity (including busking) must comply with all of the following:

a. Allow a continuous clear width of pedestrian access routes (exclusive of the width of the curb) of five feet minimum to accommodate pedestrian travel and in particular persons with disabilities. To the extent possible, the five-foot “clear space” shall be located in the middle area of the sidewalk, so as to avoid having pedestrians having to weave through structures.

b. At any intersection, not occupy or use any area on the sidewalk or other public area within the following defined area:

i. For any intersection with two marked crosswalks (or other clear markings showing the area for pedestrians to cross), the area that is within an extension of the two lines of perpendicular sidewalks that represent the outer side of the crosswalks (or other clear markings showing the area for pedestrians to cross). The outer side is the one furthest from the intersection.

ii. For an intersection with only one marked crosswalk, then the area that is within (A) an extension of a line that represents the outer side of the crosswalk, and (B) the perpendicular right-of-way line. The outer side is the one furthest from the intersection.

iii. For an intersection with no marked crosswalks, the area that is within an extension of the perpendicular right-of-way lines.

Provided, if there is a bench located within this defined area, nothing prevents a person from using the bench and area within three feet in front of the bench for protected speech activity so long as the rules in subsection (B)(1)(f) of this section are met.

The following illustration provides examples:


[IMAGE]


c. Within the following described areas of the civic district, the following rules apply (these rules overlap):

i. Pope Marine Park – stairs: No use shall occur (no obstructions should be placed) in the area within 10 feet of the top of the stairs or on the stairs.

ii. Pope Marine Park – Madison side of park and corner of Madison and Water Streets (and delineated by the stairs to the park and the concrete wall extending along the back side of the sidewalk on Madison Street and in a circular manner around the corner to where it ends close to Pope Marine Building): No use should occur (no obstructions should be placed) within 10 feet of the stairs or this edge.

iii. Pope Marine Building, City Dock, Wave Viewing Gallery: No use shall occur (no obstructions should be placed) on these structures or within 10 feet of their entrance(s).

iv. No use shall interfere with or block a fire lane.

d. Not occupy or use any area of the sidewalk within 30 inches of a parking area. The 30 inches provides an area to allow persons to enter or exit a vehicle.

e. Not occupy or use any area that physically obstructs or impedes the free passage of a person seeking to enter or depart from a park or public space or private building.

f. Not occupy or use any area that physically obstructs or that interferes with use of a public amenity (for example, a public bench). Placing structures in a manner that constitutes “use” under PTMC 9.46.020 within five feet of the sides or back of a public bench and within 20 feet of the front of a public bench is prohibited, provided, nothing prevents a person carrying a sign from sitting on a bench, and nothing prevents a person who is busking from sitting on a bench, including placing something to collect donations directly in front of the person. Such use shall not have the effect of taking over a bench so others cannot enjoy it. This rule takes precedence over any prohibition on uses at intersections.

g. Maximum sign area is eight square feet per sign face; maximum width of a sign or structure is 30 inches; maximum height of any sign is four feet.

h. Structures may not be placed any closer than 12 inches from any tree grate or other planting.

i. Not occupy or use an area within 10 feet of any public art, except within 20 feet of the Salish Sea Circle (corner of Madison and Water Streets). Examples of public art include the Salish Sea Circle (corner of Madison and Water Streets) and Haller Fountain (Taylor and Washington Streets).

j. Not occupy or use a space larger than four feet wide by six feet long, and no structure may exceed five feet in height. The area is a contiguous area. A person may not use, for example, a portion of the allowed area in one spot and use the balance of the allotted area in another spot outside the four-foot by six-foot area, and move back and forth between the spots.

The area limitation is “per person,” meaning, for example, that two individuals playing music together (and placing structures like guitar cases on the sidewalk) may each occupy an area of four feet by six feet. In other words, a group of musicians is not prevented by the four-foot-by-six-foot area limitation from playing together as a group.

k. To the extent the foregoing rules in subsections (B)(1)(a) through (j) of this section may conflict in specific circumstances, the more restrictive rule shall apply.

2. If any structure or material is located on the sidewalk (for example, table, self-standing sign, placards, displays, boxes, supplies), it must be located in conjunction with related protected speech activities, and is only allowed so long as the structure or material is attended (and not left unattended). For purposes of this section, “attended” means the person who places the structure or material remains next to the structure(s) or material(s); provided, nothing prevents the person from leaving the area for up to five minutes every 60 minutes. “Next to” means being no further than 10 feet from any structure or material.

3. Except as provided in this chapter, no one shall attach, lean or place any sign or structure on or against any city property or other government agency’s property, or private property, without the written permission of the owner of the property. (Ord. 3107 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3091 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


9.46.040 Administrative regulations.

A. The chief of police may adopt administrative regulations that are consistent with and that further or implement the terms and requirements set forth in these rules or the ordinance to which the rules are related. This authority is in recognition that not all situations that constitute substantial and unreasonable interference with pedestrian or vehicular traffic or that constitute a safety hazard can be anticipated or covered by an ordinance or set of rules, and there may be situations where the chief of police needs to act administratively before the city council can act.

Before adopting an administrative regulation, the administrative regulations shall be reviewed with the mayor (or in the mayor’s absence, the deputy mayor), city manager and city attorney.

B. Administrative regulations shall be posted on the city’s website, and kept on file with the chief of police and the city clerk, and shall be available on request by a member of the public for inspection or copying. On adoption, the administrative regulations shall be immediately forwarded to the city council. (Ord. 3107 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3091 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


9.46.050 Variance.

A. Any person may apply in writing to the chief of police for a variance from the requirements of this chapter and these rules, or any administrative regulations, or event or temporary use permit conditions. The person making the request shall include his or her name, address, and other contact information, provide information reasonably related to the request showing a basis for variance or departure from the requirements and, if the variance relates to free speech or expressive activity, why the speech or expressive activities that are restricted by this chapter or otherwise are not reasonable or sufficient to enable the person to communicate the person’s message. The chief of police may attach conditions to any variance that are consistent with the purposes of this chapter and these rules. The chief of police (or designee) shall provide a written response to the request for variance as soon as possible, and no later than one business day following the request.

B. Any applicant for a variance may appeal the decision of the chief of police by filing a written request to the city manager within five business days of the date of the police chief’s written decision. The city manager shall issue a decision within five business days of the request. (Ord. 3107 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3091 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


9.46.060 Interpretation.

A. Any person may apply in writing to the chief of police for an interpretation of the requirements of these rules or the ordinance to which the rules are related, including, to interpret the scope, intent or meaning of any provision of the ordinance or rules, or any administrative regulations, or event or temporary use permit conditions. The chief (or designee) shall provide a written response to the request for interpretation as soon as possible, and no later than one business day.

B. Any applicant for an interpretation of the requirements of these rules or the ordinance to which the rules are related may appeal the decision of the chief of police by filing a written request to the city manager within five business days of the date of the police chief’s written decision. The city manager shall issue a decision within five business days of the request. (Ord. 3107 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3091 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


9.46.070 Enforcement – Violations.

A. All persons must comply with written or oral instructions issued by the chief of police or a police officer to enforce these rules or the ordinance to which the rules are related, or any administrative regulations, or event or temporary use permit conditions adopted pursuant to this chapter.

B. Before enforcing this chapter or these rules, or any administrative regulations, or event or temporary use permit conditions, police officer(s) shall give a verbal warning informing the violator of this chapter and these rules, including any administrative regulations adopted by the chief of police (or designee), and an opportunity to cease the activity. If the violator continues the activity after this warning, the police may proceed with enforcement.

C. Violation of this chapter or these rules, or an administrative regulation issued by the chief of police (or designee), or the terms of any variance, or the terms of any event or temporary use permit conditions, shall constitute a civil infraction, and the chief of police or city police officer may issue a notice of civil infraction pursuant to Chapter 7.80 RCW. Civil infractions are not crimes. The provisions of Chapter 7.80 RCW, including any amendments thereto, are adopted by reference in this chapter and rules as if set forth in full. “Enforcement officer” as set forth in Chapter 7.80 RCW is the chief of police (or designee) or police officer of the police department.

The civil infraction penalty is $100.00 per violation.

D. A person who has been issued a notice of civil infraction for a violation of this chapter or these rules, or an administrative regulation issued by the chief of police, or the terms of any variance, and who willfully and knowingly continues or engages in additional conduct prohibited by this chapter or these rules, or an administrative regulation issued by the chief of police, or the terms of any variance after having been issued a notice of civil infraction for a violation of this chapter or these rules, or an administrative regulation issued by the chief of police, or the terms of any variance, or fails to comply with a directive to cease the activity, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and may be cited and/or arrested in connection with the offense.

E. Unattended structures, materials or obstructions may be picked up and removed without notice by the city. Except in an emergency, the police shall make a reasonable effort to notify the person responsible for the unattended structures, materials or obstructions of attendance requirements (including breaks as provided above) and to advise the person that unattended structures, materials or obstructions are not permitted and are subject to removal. “Reasonable notice” may be leaving a written notice on the structures, materials or obstructions of the requirements of city code. Attended structures, materials or obstructions may be picked up and removed after notice by the city to the violator of the violation and the violator, after being given an opportunity to cease the activity, fails to do so.

9.50.010 Purpose, authority, and applicability.

A. The purpose of this policy is to adopt a legally sound process for being able to exclude from city and other publicly owned property individuals whose behavior is dangerous, unsafe, illegal, or unreasonably disruptive to other users. It is further the purpose of this policy to provide for a specific method to allow for the issuance of trespass warnings to such individuals, including placing limitations on trespass warnings and providing procedures for such individuals to promptly appeal the issuance of trespass warnings to protect their right to engage in legitimate activities protected by the state and federal constitutions.

B. This policy is enacted as an exercise of the city’s authority to protect and preserve the public health, safety and welfare.

C. This policy shall apply to all city and other publicly owned property in the city of Port Townsend (“city”), including property that public entities own in common with each other. This chapter shall not apply to public streets and sidewalks. Enforcement action shall only be taken for conduct violating rules adopted for the location in which the conduct occurs, except that officers of the city police department may take enforcement action based on violations of other city codes, state statutes, and government rules or regulations.

D. This chapter shall be enforced to emphasize voluntary compliance with laws and city (or other governmental entity) property rules and so that inadvertent minor violations of this section can be corrected without resort to a trespass warning.

E. The city manager is authorized to adopt rules and procedures consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 3182 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).


9.50.020 Definitions.

A. Behavior that is “dangerous” is behavior that creates an imminent and unreasonable risk of injury or harm to either persons or property of another or the actor.

B. Behavior that is “illegal” is behavior that is prohibited by the laws of the United States, Washington State, Jefferson County, or the city and that includes, but is not limited to, any of the following types of behavior:

1. Threatening another person by communicating either directly or indirectly to another person the intent to cause bodily injury in the future to the person threatened or to any other person; or

2. Selling or using alcohol or drugs; or

3. Threatening or harassing behavior (e.g., fighting or threatening to fight, brandishing a weapon, stalking, verbally threatening to harm others or their property); or

4. Assaulting staff or other patrons; or

5. Sexual misconduct or harassment (e.g., indecent exposure, offensive touching, sexual acts).

C. Behavior that is “unreasonably disruptive to other users” is behavior that is not constitutionally protected and that, in consideration of the nature, scope, use and purpose of the publicly owned property in question, unreasonably interferes with others’ use and enjoyment of publicly owned property. Examples of behavior that may unreasonably interfere with others’ use and enjoyment of publicly owned property include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

1. Use of unreasonably hostile or aggressive language or gestures; or

2. Unreasonably loud vocal expression or unreasonably boisterous physical behavior; or

3. Using electronic or other communication devices in a manner that is unreasonably disruptive to others; or

4. Unreasonably interfering with the free passage of staff or patrons in or on public property; or

5. Behavior that is unreasonably inconsistent with the normal use for which the publicly owned property was designed and intended to be used (e.g., bathing, shaving, or washing clothes in a public bathroom or skating/skateboarding in a public parking area or plaza).

D. Any constitutionally protected action or speech is excluded from the prohibited behavior listed in this section.

E. “City or publicly owned property” means any part of a building, park, trail, or open space that is owned or controlled by the city or a public agency. (Ord. 3182 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).


9.50.030 Authority to issue trespass warnings – Service.

A. Officers of the city police department are authorized to issue a trespass warning to any individual who the officer has probable cause to believe has violated any city ordinance, state statute, or government rule or regulation, relating to or prohibiting conduct that is dangerous, illegal, or unreasonably disruptive to other users of public property, as defined in this policy, while such individual is on or within any city or other publicly owned facility, building, or outdoor area that is open to the general public.

B. Trespass warnings may be delivered in person to the individual or by first class mail to the individual at the individual’s last known address.

C. The individual need not be charged, tried, or convicted of any crime or infraction for the trespass warning to be issued or be effective. The warning may be based upon observation by a police officer or a city or other government employee or may be based upon a civilian report that would ordinarily be relied upon by police officers in the determination of probable cause. (Ord. 3182 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).


9.50.040 Duration of exclusion.

The duration of exclusion shall be as follows. If the individual:

A. Has not been excluded from city or other publicly owned property by a trespass warning issued within one year prior to the violation, then the warning may exclude the individual for a period not exceeding seven days from the date of the warning.

B. Has been the subject of only one prior trespass warning issued within one year prior to the current violation, then the warning may exclude the individual for a period of more than seven days but not more than 90 days from the date of the current warning.

C. Has been the subject of two or more prior trespass warnings issued within one year prior to the current violation, then the warning may exclude the individual for a period of more than 90 days but not more than one year from the date of the current warning.

D. Has been excluded from city or other publicly owned property by a trespass warning, and a published rule or regulation applicable to such property establishes a different period of time for an individual to be excluded, the time period under such rule or regulation shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of this section. (Ord. 3182 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).


9.50.050 Content of trespass warning.

The trespass warning shall be in writing, shall contain the date of issuance, shall describe the behavior that is the basis for the trespass warning, shall specify the length and place(s) of exclusion, shall be signed by the issuing police officer, and shall state the consequences for failure to comply. A trespass warning for a place or places shall not prohibit access to another place or places that are unrelated to or not a part of the place where the conduct that is the subject of the trespass warning occurred. (Ord. 3182 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).


9.50.060 Review procedure.

A. For good cause, the city manager, or his or her designee, or other government official who is responsible for the property in question may rescind, shorten or modify a trespass warning issued.

1. A written request for review of a trespass warning must be delivered to the city clerk no later than seven business days after it is issued;

2. The city manager or specified designee will, within one business day of receipt of a request for review of any trespass warning that excludes the individual for seven or fewer days, review the decision;

3. The city manager or specified designee will, within two business days of receipt of a request for review of any trespass warning that excludes the individual for more than seven days, review the decision;

4. The city clerk will notify the individual of the date, time, and place or telephone number at which the review will be conducted;

5. The review decision shall be communicated no later than two business days following the review;

6. As a follow-up to verbal communication, specify how a written decision will be served on the individual; and

7. At the end of every written decision, inform the individual that he/she has the right to seek judicial review of the decision and that the time frame for seeking judicial review runs from the date of service of the written decision.

B. For purposes of this section, “good cause” to rescind, shorten or modify a trespass warning shall be found where:

1. The individual demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her conduct was intended to be expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment; or

2. The individual was not given warning that the conduct in question was subject to a trespass warning; or

3. The trespass warning was based solely upon the statement of a third party, was not observed personally by the issuing officer or a city or other government employee, would not ordinarily be relied upon by police officers in the determination of probable cause, and the individual claims that he or she did not commit the action for which he or she was warned; or

4. In the judgment of the city manager or his/her designee, the circumstances warrant a modification or rescission of the trespass warning. The city manager or his/her designee shall rescind the trespass warning if, considering all the circumstances, he or she finds that reasonable minds could differ on the question of whether the conduct in question was unreasonably disruptive to others on the same public property at that time.

C. At the review hearing, the violation must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence to uphold the trespass warning. The city manager or designee shall consider a sworn report or declaration from the officer who issued the trespass warning or upon whose observation the trespass warning was based, without further evidentiary foundation, as prima facie evidence that the individual committed the violation as described. The city manager or designee may consider information that would not be admissible under the evidence rules in a court of law but that the city manager or designee considers relevant and trustworthy. If the warning was issued because of the alleged violation of any criminal law, the individual need not be charged, tried, or convicted for the warning to be upheld.

D. If the city manager or designee rescinds an exclusion, for good cause or because the violation was not proved, the exclusion shall not be considered a prior trespass warning for purposes of this section.

E. The decision of the city manager or designee will be the city’s final decision. An individual seeking judicial review of the city’s final decision must file an application for a writ of review in Jefferson County superior court within 15 days of receipt of the city’s final decision.

F. The trespass warning shall remain in effect during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding.

G. No determination of facts made by the city manager or designee shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding and shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding. (Ord. 3182 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).


9.50.070 Violation – Penalty.

A. Any person who is found on city or other publicly owned property in violation of a trespass warning issued in accordance with this chapter may be arrested for trespassing, except as otherwise provided in this section.

B. The chief of police or designee may upon request authorize an individual who has received a trespass warning in accordance with this chapter to enter city or other publicly owned property to exercise his or her First Amendment rights or to conduct government business, if there is no other reasonable alternative location to exercise such rights or conduct such business. Such authorization must be in writing and specify the duration of the authorization and any conditions thereof.

C. The chief of police or designee shall issue a decision on a request for entry onto public property by the recipient of a trespass warning during a period of exclusion no later than 48 hours after receipt of the request. (Ord. 3182 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).

2. May occur on streets or alleys or within rights-of-way, and on city-owned or controlled property. 

3. May include prescribed methods of parking (for example, angle parking).

10.16.070 Application – Investigation.

Upon receiving any application for a loading zone, the chief of police shall investigate the application to determine the need and feasibility in establishing the loading zone, and is empowered to grant or deny the application. Any person who feels himself aggrieved by reason of the granting or denial of a loading zone, as hereinabove provided, may, within 30 days of the granting or denial thereof, appeal to the city council, and the city council may, by motion, affirm or reverse the decision of the chief of police.

11.01.080    Repealed.

11.01.090    Repealed.


11.01.010 Purpose.

A. The city council determines it appropriate to set reasonable time, place and manner restrictions for use of parks in order to accommodate and balance a variety of public interests, including protected speech.

B. Parks should be open and accessible to enable persons to enjoy these assets.

C. These rules and regulations are designed and intended to accommodate these important public interests: (1) maintaining the use of parks for public enjoyment and other public purposes (temporary events, etc.); (2) maintaining the use of parks for safe, efficient and reasonably unimpeded use and travel by persons who are infirm, elderly or disabled and to accommodate assistance devices such as wheelchairs, walkers, crutches and similar devices; (3) protecting the city’s investment in infrastructure, including parks, designed to promote tourism and economic development; (4) assisting cleaning and maintenance of parks; (5) preserving the safety and aesthetic appearance of public places as inviting areas for pedestrians, and avoiding having parks cluttered with different structures; and (6) providing an opportunity for a diversity of activities, views, or opinions.

D. Without reasonable limits, certain activities effectively and unreasonably take over substantial portions of a park and substantially interfere with free, open and broad use by various groups and individuals, and during events, can create safety issues.

E. Having rules in place serves the important function of providing clear standards for what activities can take place in parks and under what conditions so that users may know in advance of any activity what is allowed.

F. These rules provide the opportunity for anyone to obtain an administrative interpretation of these rules if a user is unclear of the standards and requirements and wishes to obtain an interpretation in advance of engaging in any conduct.

G. These rules also provide an opportunity to seek a variance from the application of the rules if the user believes their application causes unnecessary hardship or interference with a person’s ability to communicate protected speech.

H. These rules build on and supplement – but do not replace – other rules and regulations that allow specified activity in parks and similar public areas. For example, Pope Marine Building Use Regulations (Chapter 11.04 PTMC) and Chetzemoka Park Facility Use (Chapter 11.06 PTMC). Activities in public or private areas are also subject to the city’s noise ordinance (Chapter 9.09 PTMC). Activities in public or private areas can constitute public nuisances under the city’s nuisance code (Chapters 9.08 and 9.10 PTMC). Activities can be subject to traffic and criminal codes, for example, RCW 9A.84.030(1)(c), which makes intentional obstruction of vehicular or pedestrian traffic without lawful authority a misdemeanor.

I. These rules are also necessary to ensure that persons with disabilities have safe and unimpeded access to and through parks and similar places, and to comply with state and federal disabilities laws.

J. These rules define the legislative balance of placing reasonable limits on protected speech but allowing ample opportunity for persons to engage in protected speech and expression in city parks.

K. These rules are designed to protect the public health, safety, welfare and economic prosperity of the city of Port Townsend. (Ord. 3092 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


11.01.020 Definitions.

A. “Busking” means to play music or otherwise perform for voluntary donations on a public space (for example, right-of-way, sidewalk, or park).

B. “Protected speech” means verbal or written communications intended to convey a noncommercial political, religious, philosophical or other similar message to the public, and includes distributing literature, seeking petition signatures, picketing, demonstrating, carrying or displaying signs, billboards, posters and similar messaging, artistic performance, or other activities recognized by the courts as entitled to protection under federal or Washington constitutions.

C. “Public space” means any part of a park or open space that is not privately owned and that is owned, controlled, managed or operated by the city and available for use by the public.

D. “Use” means the exercise of dominion or control over or occupation of all or part of a public space. It includes construction, storing, erecting, placing upon, or maintaining, operating any inanimate thing or object in, upon, over, under any public space. “Use” includes the placement of a table, equipment, or other similar object. “Use” does not include the placement of an inanimate object in such a location and for such a limited duration of time that, under the circumstances, no reasonable persons could conclude that the public’s right to use or enjoy the public space, in whole or in part, had been or potentially could have been interfered with. For a park, “use” does not include a person’s or group of persons’ placement of a picnic basket or blanket or similar objects within a park for the person’s or persons’ enjoyment while at the park, since no reasonable persons could conclude that the public’s right to use or enjoy the public space, in whole or in part, had been or potentially could have been interfered with by such normal park uses. “Use” includes busking if the busker places objects on the public space (for example, guitar case) and leaves it there in a manner that meets the definition of “use” above. (Ord. 3092 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).


11.01.030 Rules of conduct.

Certain park use and activity is allowed pursuant to city regulation and permit (for example, weddings and parties or events permitted by Chapter 11.06 PTMC, Chetzemoka Park Facility Use).

The following rules of conduct apply to park use and activity where no city permit or variance has been obtained. These rules apply to all persons, including those engaged in any of the following activities: leafleting and signature gathering, busking, carrying stick-mounted signs, posters, billboards or similar messaging, or other free speech or expressive activity.

A. No person shall treat any person in an aggressive, menacing, threatening or abusive manner that would place a reasonable person in fear for their property or personal safety.

B. Leafleting and signature gathering, busking, carrying stick-mounted signs, posters, billboards or similar messaging, and similar free speech activities shall be done in a manner that does not substantially or unduly interfere with the use of the park for the public, including those with disabilities, or that poses a safety hazard.

Article I. General Provisions 


12.04.010 Intent – Findings.

A. In accordance with the Growth Management Act (GMA) (Chapter 36.70A RCW), the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan seeks to ensure that appropriate public services and facilities, including transportation facilities, are provided concurrently with development. It is hereby found that the provisions of this title are necessary to implement the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan.

B. It is further found that the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan sets forth the following policy direction and that the provisions of this title are necessary to implement the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan: (1) allow relatively narrow local access streets so as to meet the goals of preserving the small town character of Port Townsend, lowering construction and maintenance costs and reducing impervious surfaces, while at the same time assuring that local access streets are safe and have adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities; (2) adopt standards for local access streets that strike a balance between initial expense and long-term operations and maintenance costs; and (3) promote nonmotorized travel and create an integrated network of bicycle and pedestrian pathways that provide incentives to walk or bicycle across town.

C. It is further found that the acquisition, construction, and improvement of streets and other transportation facilities to serve new developments in the city of Port Townsend imposes a major burden upon city taxpayers; that as an urban growth area, the city expects to experience an increasing intensity of land use and population growth which creates an increased demand for city transportation system services; that existing and projected city funds are inadequate to meet future projected transportation needs; that a failure to ensure that adequate transportation system improvements are made as traffic and street usage increases will cause safety problems, impede commerce and interfere with the comfort and repose of the public; and that alternative methods of travel, including a nonmotorized transportation network, provision for public transit, transportation demand management and other similar improvements are necessary to reduce the demands on and the costs of maintaining the street network.

D. It is further found that the city has the authority under existing law to condition development and require right-of-way and transportation system improvements where reasonably necessary to mitigate the direct impacts of a proposed development or use, and that it is appropriate and desirable to set out standards for development in this title and in an adopted engineering design standards manual.

E. It is further found that it may not be in the best interest of the public to improve all currently platted streets. Therefore, certain rights-of-way may be designated by the city for bicycle- and pedestrian-only connections, public access to vistas and shorelines, stormwater facilities, traffic calming, utility easements, and other uses; provided, however, that this policy shall not be construed as preventing the opening of rights-of-way so as to deprive property owners of reasonable access to their property.

F. It is further found and declared that the regulations contained in this title are necessary to ensure that public health, safety and welfare will be preserved by having an adequate transportation system serving new and existing development by requiring that all development mitigate transportation impacts, which may include constructing improvements, that have been identified as a consequence of a proposed development or use; to provide for the equitable sharing of private improvement costs; to promote the orderly and economic development of the city-maintained transportation network, and to otherwise protect the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.020 Purpose – Authority.

The purpose of this title is to establish:

A. The authority of the city to require any person (1) applying for a building permit or other development permit required under PTMC Titles 16, 17 or 18, (2) seeking to temporarily use a public right-of-way for vehicle access, (3) seeking to open, develop or improve any right-of-way or easement for bicycle or vehicular traffic, or (4) proposing other transportation-related improvements within the right-of-way, to apply for and receive a street development utility permit as a prerequisite to development, to comply with the terms and conditions of such permit, and to conform to the requirements of the engineering design standards manual;

B. Predictable, clear, uniform and consistent procedures and permitting requirements that apply to all developments for the provision of safe and adequate access;

C. Criteria which will be used to determine the nature, extent and location of required right-of-way and transportation system improvements;

D. A procedure for the public works director to grant, on a case-by-case basis, a waiver or modification of, or variance from, the requirements of this chapter. This authority is based on a recognition that variances from the required standards may be necessary or appropriate in certain cases, and that where a proposed deviation from certain engineering design standards is minor or appropriate, it is desirable to give the public works director the discretion to waive or modify technical compliance with such standards; and

E. The authority of the public works director to impose conditions upon development to mitigate the problems caused by a particular development or use. The basis for this authority comes from the following statutes: Article XI, § 11 of the State Constitution; PTMC Title 18 and Chapter 58.17 RCW (Subdivisions), Chapter 19.04 PTMC and Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA), Chapter 19.05 PTMC (ESA ordinance), RCW 35A.63.100 and 35A.47.020, the International Fire Code (adopted in PTMC Title 16), and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws. Mitigation measures made a condition of development under the authority of this chapter are not intended to be, and shall not be construed as, transportation impact fees under RCW 82.02.020. (Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).

“Peak hour trips,” for the purposes of Chapter 12.06 PTMC, means the number of trips by land use type and land use size which are generated during peak hour as determined by the Trip Generation Manual of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other recognized data source.

“Peak hour volume to capacity ratio (V/C),” for the purposes of Chapter 12.06 PTMC, means the volume of actual or projected traffic as measured in number of vehicles per hour in the peak hour divided by the capacity of a roadway or several roadway segments as measured in number of vehicles per hour.

“Pedestrian” has its ordinary meaning and shall include motorized and nonmotorized wheelchairs.

“Person” means any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, organization or entity of any kind.

“Property owner,” for the purposes of Chapter 12.26 PTMC, means the record owner, based on the records of the Jefferson County assessor, on the day the street latecomer agreement is signed by the parties.

“Reasonably funded,” for the purposes of Chapter 12.06 PTMC, means a project in the currently adopted six-year transportation improvement program (TIP) or other project in the capital facilities and utilities element of the comprehensive plan, for which funds are in hand, or the city is expected to have sufficient funds secured for construction within the six-year timeframe of the TIP.

“Right-of-way” means property acquired by or dedicated to the city and available for use in pedestrian, vehicular or other transportation modes. Right-of-way may or may not be accessible for public use, and may or may not contain an opened street.

“Right-of-way improvements” means the installation of all public facilities required to improve the streets to city street standards, including grading, pavement, utilities, curb and gutter, walkways, pathways, sidewalks, bicycle paths and lanes, storm drainage, street lights, traffic signals, signs and other traffic control devices, landscaping, cul-de-sacs/hammerheads, street widening, on-street parking, driveways, bikeways, and other necessary appurtenances.

1. “Improvement,” for the purposes of Chapter 12.12 PTMC, means all work to construct, reconstruct, and repair sidewalks, gutters and curbs along, and driveways across, sidewalks.

2. “Street improvements” subject to reimbursement under Chapter 12.26 PTMC may include the design, inspection, surveying, acquisition of right-of-way and/or easements, grading, construction, paving, installation of curbs, streets, gutters, storm drainage, sidewalks or bike lanes incorporated as part of the street improvements, street lighting, signs, planting strips, traffic controls, and other similar improvements as required by the street standards of the city. The term “street improvements” is used interchangeably with the term “street projects” in Chapter 12.26 PTMC.

“Roadway screenline,” for purposes of Chapter 12.06 PTMC, means an imaginary line bisecting a travel corridor to assess vehicle travel demand and capacity.

“Sidewalk” means any and all pedestrian structures or forms of improvements for pedestrians included in the space between the street and the margin, as defined by a curb or the edge of traveled road surface and the line where the public right-of-way meets the abutting property.

“Significant trees and vegetation” means all trees and vegetation, unless otherwise exempted, situated within opened or unopened public rights-of-way, as follows: (1) trees with a diameter of 12 inches or greater measured four feet from the ground; (2) trees with a diameter of six inches or greater measured four feet from the ground and identified in the engineering design standards manual as special landmark or unique species; or (3) any shrubs or other vegetation identified in the engineering design standards manual as landmark or unique species.

“Street” is intended to be broadly defined, and includes any street, highway, easement, avenue, alley or other public right-of-way or public grounds intended for travel, parking or access for vehicles, bicycles or equestrians or any other legitimate street purpose, whether opened or unopened, platted and partially improved or open but not improved to the level required by the city. Specific street classifications are defined in the engineering design standards manual and are generally to be considered as follows:

1. “Local access street” means a public right-of-way used primarily to provide access to abutting residential properties, and includes any street not designated in the engineering design standards manual as a collector, minor arterial, or principal arterial street.

2. “Collector street” means a street that collects traffic from local streets and connects with minor and major arterials, and includes, but is not limited to, any street designated as a collector street in the engineering design standards manual.

3. “Minor arterial street” means a street with signals at important intersections and stop signs on the side streets and that collects and distributes traffic to and from collector streets, and includes, but is not limited to, any street designated as a minor arterial street in the engineering design standards manual.

4. “Principal arterial street” shall have the same meaning as “major arterial” in the comprehensive plan, and means a street with access control, channelized intersections, restricted parking, and that collects and distributes traffic to and from minor arterials, and includes, but is not limited to, any street designated as a major arterial street in the engineering design standards manual. Direct access to a major arterial is usually restricted to intersecting streets or consolidated commercial or industrial entrances.

“Street development permit” means any permit required under the provisions of PTMC Titles 12, 13, 17 and 18 for work in the public right-of-way and is used interchangeably with the terms “street development and utility digging permit” and “street and utility development permit.” A street development permit includes a minor activities permit issued under PTMC 12.04.070.

“Street latecomer agreement” or “assessment reimbursement contract” means a written agreement, recorded in the Jefferson County auditor’s office, between the city, as approved by the city council and executed by the mayor, and one or more developers providing both for construction of street projects and for partial reimbursement to the developer by owner(s) of properties benefited by the improvements if such owner(s) develop the benefited property within the 15-year term of the agreement.

“Substandard street” means any street that does not meet the city’s engineering design standards and is not an approved street under this chapter.

“Tiers 1, 2, and 3” refer to the city’s infrastructure tiering strategy, which is designed to promote infill and discourage “leap frog” development, as further set forth in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan (see Chapter VII, pages VII-4 to VII-5). A map designating the various tiers in accordance with the comprehensive plan is attached as an exhibit to the engineering design standards manual.

“Transportation demand management” (“TDM”) refers to policies and public and private programs that manage the demand placed on transportation supply. TDM measures are frequently directed toward increasing the use of transit and car pools.

“Transportation improvement program (TIP)” means a subset of projects contained in the city’s capital improvement program. The TIP is a set of comprehensive street programs/projects which after a public hearing is annually adopted by the city council for the purpose of advancing plans for not less than six years as a guide for carrying out the coordinated transportation/street construction program. The six-year TIP contains a small group of capacity projects which will be considered reasonably funded for determining transportation concurrency and impact fees. The adoption of the six-year TIP identifies projects for which the city will actively pursue funds so as to implement the capacity component of the transportation improvement program as practicable with available resources.

“Transportation system” means the full range of infrastructure provided for all modes of travel, including motorized and nonmotorized travel.

“Volume to capacity ratio (V/C)” means the volume of actual or projected traffic as measured in vehicles per hour divided by the capacity of the roadway as measured in vehicles per hour.

“Walkway” includes any sidewalk, trail, pathway or other form of improvement designed and intended for use by pedestrians.

“Zoning map” is the official land use map which classifies all land within the city limits of Port Townsend with one of the land uses. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2879 § 6.1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 3(Exh. C § 3), 2003; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.040 Engineering design standards manual adopted – Purpose – Administration.

A. Standards Adopted. The city engineering design and construction standards and specifications contained in the engineering design standards manual, as it now exists or is later amended, are hereby adopted, incorporated by reference, and made applicable to all right-of-way and transportation system improvements covered by this title; provided, however, that where an applicant for a building or street development permit has applied for and received written preapplication review prior to the effective date of this code (April 28, 1997), to the extent there is an inconsistency between the right-of-way improvements identified in the preapplication review and the engineering design standards manual, the requirements of the preapplication review shall apply if:

1. The applicant submits a complete application within 12 months from the date of the written preapplication review;

2. The application is in substantial conformance with the written assurances and requirements provided by the city at the conclusion of the preapplication review; and

3. All improvements are designed and installed in full conformance with the standards and criteria as provided by the city during or after the preapplication review.

B. Capital Facilities Tiering Map. The capital facilities tiering map attached as an exhibit to the engineering design standards manual is hereby adopted. The map is intended to implement the capital facilities tiering strategy pursuant to the capital facilities and utilities element of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan.

C. Purpose.

1. The purpose of the engineering design standards manual is to establish, in one comprehensive document, prescriptive and performance standards and procedures for infrastructure development. The manual updates and revises existing standards for the construction of right-of-way improvements in order to implement the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan and to make the requirements for transportation system development more uniform, clear, consistent and predictable.

2. The public works director is authorized to make minor, technical changes to the engineering design standards manual without further city council approval or adoption, although such minor changes must still be forwarded to city council. Such changes shall be effective upon filing with the city clerk. Significant or substantive changes to the engineering design standards manual require approval by the city council, and are effective upon such approval. Changes to the capital facilities tiering map shall be considered substantive.

3. Copies of the engineering design standards manual and all revisions shall be maintained in the city clerk’s office, the DSD department, and the public works department for use and examination by the public, and shall be made available for purchase at City Hall.

D. To the extent a conflict exists between this title and the engineering design standards manual, the code shall prevail. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.050 Gateway plan incorporated by reference.

The Port Townsend Gateway development plan is incorporated by reference and adopted as a part of this title as policy direction for new development, redevelopment, and future improvements along SR 20/Sims Way, and prevails over any inconsistent standards in the engineering design standards manual. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.055 Transportation functional plan incorporated by reference.

The Port Townsend transportation functional plan is incorporated by reference and adopted as a part of this title as policy direction for guidance on long-term vehicular circulation issues that face the city. (Ord. 3054 § 2, 2011).


12.04.060 Tiering – Expenditure of public funds.

As set forth in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan, the city has adopted a tiering structure for the phasing or prioritizing of capital improvements in a manner designed to promote orderly growth and development and efficient use of city resources. Accordingly, if the location, nature, and/or timing of a proposed development necessitates the expenditure of public funds in excess of those currently available in the six-year CIP for the necessary right-of-way or transportation system improvements, and provision has not otherwise been made to meet the mitigation of direct traffic impact requirements as provided in this title, the city may refuse to approve or grant a permit for development pursuant to the concurrency requirements of the Growth Management Act. As an alternative, the city (1) will consider alternatives to the proposal so that the need for the improvements is lessened; (2) may provide the developer with the option of bearing the full cost of the required improvements; or (3) may consider the development for approval upon alternative arrangements for financing of the necessary improvements, such as no-protest LID covenants or latecomer agreements. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).

Article II. Permit Processing and Administration 


12.04.070 Street development permit required – Revocation – Expiration.

A. Director Authority. The public works director is designated to administer this title by granting or denying street development permit applications in accordance with its provisions.

B. Prerequisite to Development. Construction of the right-of-way and transportation improvements required by this chapter and the engineering design standards manual are prerequisite to, and condition of, further property development.

C. Permit Required. Unless authorized by other city regulations, no person shall clear, grade, disturb, construct, landscape, or make improvements within any right-of-way, or open for vehicular traffic (even temporarily) any city right-of-way, or use any right-of-way, without first obtaining a street development permit from the public works director as provided in this chapter.

A permit shall not be required of persons performing minor landscaping work in the right-of-way, so long as the work meets the standards of PTMC 12.04.075; provided, however, that no such person shall obtain any vested rights.

1. Minor Activities Permit. A short form “street development permit – minor activities” application may be submitted for right-of-way improvements related to construction of minor improvements (for example, sidewalks, new driveways, culverts, private utilities to a single house) which are associated with opened streets. If the director determines that for environmental, safety or other reasons a minor activities permit is inappropriate, a street development permit shall be required. Specific activities covered by the minor activities permit shall be as defined in the engineering design standards manual.

D. Revocation. The permit granted may be revoked by the public works director without prior notice for failure to comply with any provision of the Port Townsend Municipal Code or violation of any condition imposed on the permit.

E. Expiration.

1. All street development permits not tied to a building permit shall expire unless the work is completed within 12 months after issuance of the permit unless earlier revoked; provided, however, that a written request for an extension may be made prior to expiration upon a showing to the public works director that justifiable delays or unanticipated events beyond the control of the applicant have or will preclude timely commencement or completion of the work. Any extension shall include a condition that the work will be completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed one year, as specifically set forth in the grant of the extension. Only one extension may be granted under this section.

2. All street development permits tied to a building permit shall remain valid so long as the building permit remains active with the building department, as shown in the building department files. In the event the building permit becomes inactive as further set forth in the International Building Code and PTMC Title 16, the street development permit shall automatically expire.

3. Notwithstanding subsections (E)(1) and (2) of this section, the construction of infrastructure improvements required for subdivisions under PTMC Title 18 (Land Division) may, at the discretion of the director, be phased during the statutory five-year period for final plat approval. Where the city approves a final plat prior to completion of all rights-of-way or street improvements, the construction shall occur in accordance with all requirements of any approved improvement method report. In such case the street development permit shall expire unless the work is completed in accordance with the conditions of subdivision approval, the requirements of the approved improvement method report, and/or as set forth in the street development permit itself.

F. Emergency Exception. In the case of an emergency occurring outside regular office hours, whenever an immediate excavation is necessary for the protection of life or property, the public works director may grant permission to make the necessary excavation upon the condition that an application for a permit be made under this chapter on or before noon of the next following business day.

G. City Exemptions. All maintenance work performed by or under the direction of the public works department is exempt from the permit requirements of this chapter. In the case of construction work performed by or under the direction of the public works department, preparation of drawings by the director or signing of a public construction contract shall constitute compliance with the permit requirements of this section. (Ord. 3057 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.075 Private uses in the right-of-way.

The city of Port Townsend encourages minor landscaping and planting of trees along public streets and in unopened rights-of-way. A property owner may perform minor landscaping in the right-of-way abutting the owner’s property, without need for a permit, subject to and so long as the landscaping conforms to and meets the requirements, standards and conditions of this section. A property owner may plant trees along public streets and in unopened rights-of-way, upon obtaining a permit, subject to and so long as the planting conforms to and meets the requirements, standards and conditions of this section.

The city prohibits, with limited exceptions provided for in this section, private structures in the rights-of-way (including, but not limited to, fences, sheds, garages, storage containers, propane tanks, wood piles), whether on a temporary or permanent basis.

A. Structures in the Right-of-Way.

1. Unless authorized by other city regulations (for example, special use permit, temporary fence), it is prohibited to locate private structures in the rights-of-way (including, but not limited to, fences, sheds, garages, storage containers, propane tanks, wood piles, private no parking signs, etc.), whether on a temporary or permanent basis.

Exception: Mailboxes or house numbering are allowed uses of the right-of-way, and do not require a permit. They must be located as determined appropriate by the public works director based on due regard for safety and parking.

2. If a structure appears to have been inadvertently located in the right-of-way many years ago, the city manager, in consultation with the public works director, is authorized to enter into a temporary use agreement to allow the structure to remain until the property redevelops, and subject to such conditions as the city manager determines are appropriate.

“Until the property redevelops” means at a minimum where costs of improvements exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the structures on the property over a five-year period.

For example, a corner of a garage, built decades ago, encroaches into the right-of-way by a foot (apparently as a result of an inaccurate survey or having been located without survey). The city manager may enter into a use agreement to allow the garage to remain, until such time at the property redevelops. Nothing would prevent the garage from being maintained. If the cost of new development or additions on the property exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the structures on the property over a five-year period, the garage encroachment would be required to be removed.

This authority is limited to substantial structures (garages, buildings), and does not extend to allowing use agreements for fences, propane tanks, woodpiles, sheds, and the like.

B. Temporary Fences in the Right-of-Way.

1. The public works director is authorized to permit temporary fencing in the right-of-way.

2. Temporary fencing would be for the purpose of protecting plantings in the right-of-way, for example, against animals (dogs, deer), or pursuant to a construction permit. It is not for the purpose of providing privacy.

3. Any temporary fencing must meet the following requirements and standards:

a. Temporary fencing requires a permit issued by the public works department.

b. Temporary fencing shall not interfere with parking or sight lines, and shall not significantly interfere with pedestrian access.

c. Temporary fencing cannot use permanent features, for example, posts set in concrete.

d. Temporary fencing is limited in duration. The public works director is directed to set terms and conditions to ensure that fencing is temporary.

C. Minor Landscaping in the Right-of-Way – No Permit Required. The graphic at the end of this section entitled “Residential Street Use Graphic” illustrates some of the features of allowed minor landscaping in the right-of-way.

1. No Permit for Minor Landscaping. Minor landscaping is allowed in the right-of-way immediately adjacent to an owner’s property, without a permit, subject to the requirements, standards and conditions of this section.

Landscaping may be allowed beyond that which is allowed in this section through a departure as provided in subsection F of this section. Landscaping that includes planting a tree or trees is subject to subsection D of this section, Planting Trees in the Right-of-Way – Permit Required, and requires a no-fee permit.

2. Minor Landscaping. “Minor landscaping” is landscaping that meets the following standards:

a. Does not interfere with street-side parking or pedestrian traffic within eight feet of the edge of any street. In this area, only grass or similar ground cover is appropriate.

b. Does not interfere with sight lines at intersections, or otherwise present a hazard.

c. Softens the streetscape and beautifies the planting strip or area between the street and property line (or sidewalk or curb and property line).

d. Generally consists of low plantings, and does not serve as a screen to prevent passersby from viewing structures on private property. Plantings or features that do not meet this standard would have the effect of privatizing the public space. See graphic at end of section for illustration. (Owners who desire privacy would erect fencing or plant landscaping on private property and not in the right-of-way.)

e. Does not consist of plantings or features that form a fence or solid hedge or screen. Plantings and features must generally be spaced and provide an open look. Such plantings or features that do not meet this standard would have the effect of privatizing the public space.

f. May consist of landscape features (wood, rocks) that are consistent with these standards.

3. The following descriptions are not requirements but are intended as defining landscaping and features that would fit within the definition of “minor landscaping.” It is not required that these descriptions be adhered to in each and every instance. However, if they are adhered to, they are a “safe harbor” so the owner knows that he or she is in compliance with city requirements:

a. Does not exceed, and is maintained not to exceed, three feet in height, except within 10 feet of an intersection or a driveway, where it shall not exceed (and is maintained not to exceed) two feet in height. Heights are measured from original grade (and not from the addition of any material).

Exception: To allow for some variation in height, for every 25 feet of frontage, minor landscaping may extend up to five feet in height for a distance not to exceed five feet in width. This exception does not apply to the area within 10 feet of an intersection.

b. Does not interfere with parking next to a developed street. Landscaping shall be located at least eight feet back from the edge of the developed street to allow this area to be used for parking. The parking area may be planted with low grass or ground cover, so long as the plantings do not interfere with parking.

c. Does not create or have the effect of creating a private enclosed area, screen, wall or hedge. Landscaping that is at least 50 percent open (viewed from above and from a cross-section) is considered not to create a private enclosed area, screen, wall or hedge. See graphic at end of section for illustration.

d. May include minor features, such as timbers, rocks, railroad ties, subject to the height and enclosed area limitations above.

e. Does not include trees, except as allowed by permit approved pursuant to subsection D of this section, Planting Trees in the Right-of-Way – Permit Required.

f. Constructed Curb. If there is a constructed curb, all landscaping is located between the curb and the property line. The area that is within two feet of the curb should be low grass or ground cover so as provide a clearance for car door openings and entry to and exit from a parked vehicle.

g. Sidewalk. If there is a sidewalk (and no constructed curb), all landscaping is located between the sidewalk and the property line. Landscaping is located at least two feet back from the sidewalk, and should not overhang the sidewalk.

h. Planting Area If There Is No Constructed Curb or Sidewalk – Developed Street. If there is no constructed curb or sidewalk, then the area that may be landscaped is between the traveled way (street) and the property line, but not within or affecting any established pedestrian path, and (except for low grass or ground cover) not within eight feet of the street (to allow for parking).

i. Planting Area If There Is No Developed Street. If there is no developed street or other city improvements (for example, trail), minor landscaping may extend one-half the distance between the center line of the right-of-way and the property line.

j. Planting Strip (the Area between the Back of a Street Curb If There Is a Curb, or Street If There Is No Curb, and the Front or Edge of a Sidewalk Closest to a Street). A planting strip may be planted subject to the requirements of subsection (C)(2) of this section, Minor Landscaping, and the following:

i. The area that is within two feet of the curb should be low grass or ground cover so as provide a clearance for car door openings and entry to and exit from a parked vehicle.

ii. Closest part of any landscaping to sidewalk is one foot.

iii. If width of planting strip is three feet or less, then only low grass or ground cover is allowed (and, with public works department approval, trees).

iv. No raised beds or planting boxes may be installed in planting strips less than three feet wide.

v. Any raised bed shall not be more than 18 inches in height or more than 20 feet in length and shall be constructed to provide a minimum of three feet of unimpeded clearance at each end to provide pedestrian access between the sidewalk and curbside vehicles.

vi. Planting boxes cannot be made of creosote coated timbers.

vii. Trees may be planted with public works department approval.

4. Restrictions. Minor landscaping is further subject to the following standards and provisions:

a. Parking Area. No landscaping can interfere with parking next to a developed street. (See above for standards.)

b. Drainage, Utilities, and City Improvements. No landscaping can have the effect of adversely affecting any drainage, any public or private utility, or any city improvements.

D. Planting Trees in the Right-of-Way – Permit Required.

1. Permit Required. A property owner may plant a tree or trees in the right-of-way abutting the owner’s property if he or she first obtains a permit from the city public works department. There is no charge for the permit. The procedure allows the city public works department to review the type of tree and the planting location. The public works director may develop and maintain standards and policies that govern the issuance of permits, and develop requirements for permit applications.

2. Standards for Planting Trees in the Right-of-Way. Standards applied by the public works director for tree planting shall give due regard to the following criteria, both at the time of planting and into the future as the tree matures:

a. Trees should not be planted in a manner that creates a safety issue or problems with sight distances for vehicles.

b. Trees should not cause problems with utilities.

c. Trees should not cause substantial interference with views.

d. Trees should be planted with due regard to the size and shape of tree, and the topography location and surroundings, and the need for spacing between trees.

e. No trees or other vegetation shall be allowed to overhang or prevent the free use of the sidewalk or roadway, or street maintenance activity, except that trees may extend over the sidewalk when kept trimmed to a height of eight feet above the sidewalk, and 14 feet above a roadway.

3. City May Assume Ownership of Tree. The public works director may assume control and ownership of any tree planted pursuant to this section. This may be done for instance if the director determines that the trees provide a significant public amenity or that such ownership better assures the survivability of the tree. City ownership only occurs if the same is documented in a writing signed by the public works director.

4. Removal of Trees in the Right-of-Way – Permit Required. Any person who desires to prune or remove any tree or remove shrubs or other vegetation from the right-of-way (except for minor landscaping) shall first obtain a permit from the public works department. There is no charge for the permit, but the procedure allows the city public works department to review and determine the appropriateness of the pruning or removal. The public works director may develop and maintain standards and policies that govern the issuance of permits, and develop requirements for permit applications.

The requirements of this subsection do not apply to the removal of minor landscaping.

5. Standards for Tree Removal or Pruning. In reviewing a request to remove or prune a tree, the director shall give due regard to the following criteria:

a. Whether the tree is dead, diseased, dying or dangerous.

b. Whether the tree was a volunteer, was planted by an abutting owner, or was planted pursuant to a city program.

c. Whether the tree is of a type not suitable for the location. For example, a fir tree growing under or into power lines may be suitable for removal.

d. Whether the tree is a suitable for the location. For example, Lombardy poplars may not be suitable street trees.

e. Impact on surrounding properties and public spaces.

f. Whether removal improves the environment. For example, the director may approve thinning of trees, or (say) removal of small alders, if this improves the environment for remaining or other species.

Conditions that do not warrant pruning or removal:

Tree is perceived as too large or tall or obstructs views, or is perceived as making too much shade; provided, some limited pruning or removal may occur if overall canopy and coverage of trees is not substantially affected. For example, if there are a number of trees blocking a view, or a number of trees in the immediate vicinity, the director may authorize a limited removal of a few trees to allow some view enhancement.

6. Conditions. Removal may be on such conditions as the director deems reasonable, and may include:

a. Requirement that the removal be done by a licensed contractor.

b. Agreement and liability insurance insuring the city from claims which may arise from or be related to the removal (in amount and form acceptable to the city attorney).

c. Removal of stumps and roots and treating the remaining roots with a suitable compound to prevent future growth.

d. Agreement for replanting (see replanting requirements below).

7. Replanting Requirements. The following replanting requirements shall apply:

a. If the tree that is removed is dead, diseased, dying or dangerous: No replacement is required.

b. If the tree is not dead, diseased, dying or dangerous: Two trees for each tree removed. Replacement trees are subject to public works approval. Trees shall be three inches diameter measured 12 inches above natural ground level. The public works director may waive or reduce requirements based on lack of space, topography, location, type and size of tree removed, or whether removal improves the environment, or other similar factors. For example, the director may, without requiring replanting, approve removal of small alders if this improves the environment for remaining or other species.

c. Planting may be on such conditions as the director deems appropriate, and may include covenants on property that provide for maintenance, and replanting if the tree does not survival for five years.

E. Conditions – Abutting Owner Responsibility and Liability.

1. The owner or abutting owner means the owner of the abutting property, and the owner and/or any person, firm, or corporation occupying or having charge or control of the abutting property.

2. Any use of the right-of-way is subject to the following:

a. The use confers no permanent right of use or ownership of the right-of-way.

b. All use is at the owner’s risk and is subject to revocation and requirement by the city that the owner remove it. The city normally would provide a minimum of 30 days’ notice to the owner to remove any use (except in cases of hazard or emergency or flagrant violation, when other notice or no notice may apply). Removal may occur whether the city develops the right-of-way for other purposes. The city reserves the right to remove the use, and/or notify the owner that a failure to remove may be enforced through provisions in this chapter.

c. If city work (trail, street, utility, etc.) occurs in the areas of any use, there is no requirement to restore the use (for example, landscaping or temporary fencing). The city may restore the area to rough grading (not to pre-existing condition, and is not obligated to replace lost or damaged plants or materials).

d. Whenever any injury or damage to any person or property shall be caused by the use, the owner and/or any person, firm, or corporation occupying or having charge or control of the abutting property shall be liable to the city for all claims, damages or injuries, costs and disbursements which the city may be required to pay to the person injured or damaged, which sums shall include all costs and attorney’s fees incurred by the city in defense of any action, provided, the abutter shall have no liability in the event that the dangerous, defective or hazardous condition was caused, created or constructed by the city or its employees, and the condition created by the city hasn’t thereafter been changed by any act of the abutter.

e. If the city determines a hazard exists, the city may require removal or that the owner provide liability insurance insuring the city from claims which may arise from or be related to the condition (in amount and form acceptable to the city attorney).

f. The city may record a notice to title on the owner’s property notifying the public that the use occupies city right-of-way and is subject to the requirements, standards and conditions of this section.

F. Departures.

1. Authority to Grant Departures. The public works director shall have the authority, under limited circumstances, to grant a departure from the requirements of this section.

2. Application Requests. The person(s) seeking a departure shall prepare and submit an application to the city on forms provided by the city.

3. Public Works Director’s Decision. Within 30 days of receipt of a complete application, the public works director shall make a determination to grant the departure, grant the departure under certain delineated conditions, or to deny the departure. For good cause, the director may extend the time for determination.

4. Criteria. A departure may be from all or part of the requirements of this section, may require other standards to be satisfied by the applicant, and may be subject to any conditions which the public works director deems necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this section in the public interest, safety and welfare. In making a determination, the public works director may grant a departure only upon specific written findings of fact and conclusions showing that the following conditions exist:

a. The departure is reasonable based on circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property, or to provide it with uses permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; and

b. The granting of the departure will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located.

By way of illustration, a departure might be warranted:

i. To allow a retaining wall in the right-of-way if reasonably necessary to prevent erosion from interfering with or damaging the right-of-way.

ii. To allow a stairway to reach an existing structure above or below the grade of the right-of-way might be permitted if other nearby owners have similar stairways to reach structures on their properties.

By way of further illustration, it is not the intent of this section that a departure would allow an owner to landscape in the right-of-way beyond the minor landscaping standards simply because a neighbor’s property has extensive, longstanding, landscaping in the right-of-way. If this situation justified a departure, then no standards would apply because of the large number of such landscaping situations that have developed in the right-of-way over time.

For uses or structures that were established before April 21, 1997 (the date of adoption of the city’s zoning code that implemented the comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to requirements of the Growth Management Act), the council provides direction that the public works director would not prioritize any code enforcement for these uses, so long as the use or structure did not present a safety hazard, was removed if it interfered with city improvements, did not interfere with views from street ends, was not intensified, and was removed if the property redeveloped. Such uses or structures could receive normal maintenance and repair, but could not be re-constructed. Such uses or structures would be brought into conformance with city code upon a substantial redevelopment of the property.

It is not the intent of this section that the public works department seek out and/or abate long-standing conditions or situations that violate the standards in this section, so long as the use or structure did not present a safety hazard, was removed if it interfered with city improvements, did not interfere with views from street ends, was not intensified, and was removed if the property redeveloped. Subject to these limitations, long-standing landscaping or trees in the right-of-way would be allowed to remain.

5. The public works director’s decision shall be made by written findings and conclusions and is a Type I administrative decision (administrative without notice, no administrative appeal).

(Ord. 3057 § 1 (Exh. B), 2012).


12.04.080 Applicant submittal and contents – Permit issuance.

A. Technical Conference. Any developer or property owner may request a technical conference and written review with the public works department, upon payment of a fee as set forth by council resolution. Such conferences are strongly encouraged and may be required by the public works director when utilities are to be extended or new streets installed. The project requirements identified during the public works review shall remain valid for a period of one year from the date of the review, unless any changes which would materially impact the design of the right-of-way and transportation system improvements are made to the proposed development, in which case requirements related to those changes may be modified.

1. The technical conference allowed by this section is intended to be a separate process from the preapplication conference required by PTMC 20.01.090, and is not required for a determination of completeness under Chapter 20.01 PTMC.

B. Form of Application – Fees. Applications for street development permits shall be on a form provided by the city. No application shall be accepted for review unless accompanied by the nonrefundable application fee set forth by council resolution. The applicant shall follow the submittal and review procedures in the engineering design standards manual. Before an application will be accepted for review it must contain all information required by the manual, including: 

1. The name of the owner or agent and mailing address, the street address or name of the premises to be developed, and the legal description of the premises to be developed;

2. The type of development proposed and the number of living units and/or the type of activity that will occur within the premises to be developed;

3. A site plan showing the proposed location of the right-of-way and transportation system improvements;

4. The design drawings and specifications of the right-of-way and transportation system improvements required under PTMC 12.04.090; and

5. Any other information deemed reasonably necessary by the director for action upon the application, or required by other provisions of this title, SEPA (Chapter 20.04 PTMC), Land Division (PTMC Title 18), the ESA ordinance (Chapter 19.05 PTMC), other city ordinances, and/or subdivision, PUD or other project approval conditions.

C. Complete Application Required. The city will not process any application unless and until the information required by subsection B of this section is substantially complete. The city may reject an application as incomplete within a reasonable time after the initial review, in which case the city shall return it to the applicant with an indication of the additional information needed to make the application complete. 

D. The applicant shall agree to hold harmless and indemnify the city as specifically described on the face of each permit.

E. No permit may be assigned to any other person(s).

F. The permit holder shall be deemed to be the property owner or franchise owner in whose name the permit is issued.

G. Issuance in Violation Deemed Inoperative. Any street development permit or other authorization issued, granted or approved in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be null and void and of no effect without the necessity of any proceedings for a revocation or nullification, and any work undertaken pursuant to any such permit or other authorization is unlawful. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.090 Preparation of plans and specifications – Surveys and engineering.

A. Plans and Surveying Requirements. All applicants shall furnish design and construction plans and specifications for proposed right-of-way and transportation system improvements. All design and construction plans and specifications shall be prepared in accordance with the city’s engineering design standards manual. If base maps prepared by a licensed land surveyor are available, the design and construction plans shall be submitted on such maps. If base maps are unavailable and the public works director determines that a survey is necessary to adequately define the limits of the right-of-way for the purposes of transportation system construction and design, the applicant shall have the right-of-way surveyed by a licensed land surveyor and the plans shall be prepared and submitted on such surveyed base maps.

B. Engineering of Plans – Costs. All design and construction plans involving the construction of a new street, or the paving of an existing street, must be prepared, signed and stamped by a Washington State licensed civil engineer. Where paving is required, the engineering design shall be to the next intersection, even if the developer is required to pave only a portion of the street. All plans shall be prepared at the developer’s sole cost.

C. Approval by Director Required. All plans prepared or required under this subsection must be reviewed and approved by the director prior to proceeding with construction of the proposed improvements, and must comply with the requirement of the engineering design standards manual.

D. Reimbursement Under Chapter 12.26 PTMC. The costs of the surveying and engineering design may be included in the total project cost subject to partial reimbursement under a “street latecomer agreement” as further set forth in Chapter 12.26 PTMC. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.100 Inspection – Fees – Deposit required.

A. All construction covered by this title must be inspected by the city. After the approval of the design and construction plans and prior to the issuance of the street development permit, the developer shall be required to pay a construction inspection fee in the amount set forth by council resolution. No inspection fee will be required for a minor activities permit. The street development permit will not be issued until the inspection fees have been deposited with the city treasurer. If, during the course of construction, the developer exceeds the two-hour allowance covered by the inspection fee, the developer will be billed for the time in excess of two hours, and no final public works sign-off shall be provided until all bills are paid.

B. The purpose of the city inspection is to verify that the improvements are installed in accordance with the project design and construction plans and specifications. The duties of the inspector, inspection procedures including requirements for preconstruction conferences, and the obligation of the developer to coordinate inspections with the city shall be followed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the engineering design standards manual. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.110 Construction and maintenance bonds.

The public works director may require that the developer furnish the city with a performance bond, in which assurance is given that the required improvements will be installed as provided by the approved plans, and that the installed improvements will be free from material defects for a period of one year from the date of city final acceptance of the street improvements. Types of securities include a bond with a surety qualified to do bonding business in the state of Washington, a cash deposit or an assigned bank account. Any security posted with the city shall be in an amount equal to 120 percent of the estimated cost for the city to contract for construction or replacement of the improvements as determined by the public works director, and shall be for a period of one year from the date of final acceptance of the improvement by the city. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.120 Acceptance of improvements.

The city reserves the right to reject any installation not inspected by the public works department, or not installed per the plans and specifications or any modifications agreed to in writing by the city. As a condition of acceptance of the improvements by the city, the developer shall provide the city with: (1) a statement of the actual cost of design and construction of the street improvements; (2) a properly executed bill of sale or conveyance for all improvements; and (3) as-built drawings prepared in accordance with the engineering design standards manual. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).

Article III. Standards and Improvement Requirements


12.04.130 General right-of-way improvement and construction requirements.

A. General Requirements.

1. Whenever new lots are proposed to be created, or previously undeveloped lots of record are proposed for development or improvement, or any type of development is proposed including a change of use, as a condition to further property development one or more of the following types of right-of-way improvements may be required to mitigate the direct impacts caused by the development or use:

a. Pavement;

b. Curb and gutter installation;

c. Walkway improvements;

d. Storm and street drainage;

e. Design of structures and/or grading to future right-of-way grade;

f. Pathways and bikeways;

g. Landscaping;

h. Driveways;

i. Street widening and turning lanes;

j. Street lighting/illumination;

k. Cul-de-sacs or hammerheads;

l. On-street parking;

m. Utilities;

n. Signs and/or other traffic control devices;

o. No-protest agreement(s);

p. Maintenance agreement(s);

q. Transit pull-outs or shelters.

2. Detailed requirements and standards for rights-of-way and transportation system improvements and development requirements are contained in the engineering design standards manual. 

3. All improvements in the public right-of-way shall be constructed by a contractor or contractors duly licensed and bonded under the laws of Washington State.

4. Where reasonably necessary to mitigate the direct impacts of the proposed development and/or to meet safety requirements, off-site improvements (including, but not limited to, provision of drainage systems, fire access roads, paving and grading of streets, pedestrian and bicycle connections, street widening or turn lanes, traffic control signals, turnarounds and related utility improvements, and/or dedication of land or easements) may be required as a condition of permit approval under the authority of this chapter, other city ordinances, the International Fire Code, Chapter 58.17 RCW and PTMC Title 18 (Land Division), Chapter 43.21C RCW and Chapter 19.04 PTMC (SEPA), or as allowed by state law.

5. The regulations in this section are not intended to supersede or preclude the use of Chapter 19.04 PTMC, the Port Townsend environmental protection ordinance relating to SEPA, to mitigate significant adverse environmental impacts where such mitigation would not be duplicative of the requirements under this chapter. For example, SEPA conditions may be required to mitigate the impacts of development on the transportation system, including but not limited to the cumulative impacts of such development, or to meet safety standards where consistent with applicable SEPA policies and Chapter 197‑11 WAC. 

6. The regulations in this section are not intended to supersede or preclude the enforcement of the provisions of Chapter 19.05 PTMC, the Port Townsend ordinance relating to critical areas. Review of development under this chapter and Chapter 19.05 PTMC shall be coordinated to ensure consistency.

7. The regulations in this section are not intended to supersede or preclude the enforcement of the provisions of the land division code, PTMC Title 18. To create uniformity of standards, it is the intent of this chapter to make the prescriptive standards in the engineering design standards manual applicable to subdivisions. In addition, approved subdivisions or existing plats with specific improvement requirements identified as conditions to the subdivision approval shall prevail over the right-of-way and transportation system standards set forth in this chapter and the engineering design standards manual, so long as street improvements are completed within five years of final plat approval or any extensions granted under PTMC Title 18.

8. The regulations in this section are not intended to supersede or preclude the enforcement of the provisions of the code relating to flood damage prevention and drainage improvement requirements, Chapter 16.08 PTMC.

9. All street development permits are subject to the erosion control, stormwater management and drainage plan requirements of Chapter 13.32 PTMC and the engineering design standards manual, which requirements may be included as conditions of street development permit approval. (Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.140 Implementation of general requirements.

A. Street Frontage Improvements. All development shall be required to make street frontage improvements on the parcels’ frontage. Such improvements may include, as further specified in the engineering design standards manual, stormwater improvements, curbs and gutters, water and sewer lines, utilities, traffic signals/signs, walkways, sidewalks, pathways, bike lanes, street trees, landscaping, street widening, and/or any other reasonably necessary improvements. Such frontage improvements shall generally include the full improvements identified in the engineering design standards manual for the type of street at issue for the side of the street abutting the lot frontage. In addition, any required grading and paving shall generally be required to extend the full width of the street, as determined by the minimum standards for the type of street set forth in the engineering design standards manual. Full improvements to both sides of the street can be required based on an individual analysis of whether such improvements are reasonably necessary to mitigate the direct impacts of development and/or meet safety concerns. The frontage improvement requirements set forth in this section may be waived if the criteria of PTMC 12.04.160 are met.

B. Minimum Right-of-Way Widths. The minimum right-of-way widths for streets and pathways shall be as specified in the engineering design standards manual.

C. Dedications/Easements. Person(s) developing property may be required to dedicate additional right-of-way or easements for public street and transportation systems to meet minimum right-of-way requirements, for public safety and compatibility with the area’s circulation system, and/or for nonmotorized pathway connections, when to do so is found to be reasonably necessary as a direct consequence of the proposed development or plat to which the dedication of land or easement is to apply.

D. Street Pavement.

1. Paving of New Streets and Connecting Unopened Streets. All unopened rights-of-way to serve a proposed development shall be graded and paved to and through the lot frontage from the nearest opened street as a condition of street development. Paving of connecting, unopened rights-of-way beyond the block on which the proposed development is located shall be required if, based on an individualized analysis, the director determines that such paving is reasonably necessary to ensure public safety (including but not limited to emergency vehicle access) and/or to mitigate the direct impacts of the development.

2. Upgrading or Paving of Opened, But Substandard Connecting Street(s). If the street to be opened and improved to serve the proposed development connects to a substandard street(s) and such substandard street(s) is the only connection to the street network, the director may require paving or upgrading of such connecting street(s). Whether such connecting street(s) must be upgraded or paved shall be based on an individualized analysis of whether such off-site improvements are reasonably necessary to ensure public safety (including but not limited to emergency vehicle access) and/or to mitigate the direct impacts of the development.

3. Paving and Upgrading of Existing Substandard Streets Abutting the Lot Frontage of the Development. Any street that does not meet the current design standards is considered a substandard street. If the proposed development is served by a substandard street abutting the lot frontage, and the proposed development creates the need for upgrading or paving the substandard street, the developer will be required to pay the full costs of upgrading or paving in order to mitigate the direct impacts of the proposed development and/or meet safety requirements.

E. Other Off-Site Improvements to Unopened or Substandard Streets. In addition to paving and grading, the director may require any and all off-site improvements, as further specified in the engineering design standards manual, reasonably necessary to mitigate the direct impacts of development and/or meet safety requirements.

F. The city reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to pay a portion or all of the costs of off-site improvements, including paving of streets, as determined on a case-by-case basis and to the extent funds are available. 

G. Dead-End Streets. The public works director may require that streets forming a permanent or temporary dead-end be improved with a cul-de-sac, hammerhead or other vehicular turnaround in accordance with the engineering design standards manual.

H. Sight Obstruction. Pedestrian, vehicle and traffic control devices, and trees and shrubbery, shall be located and maintained to prevent sight obstruction as set forth in the engineering design standards manual.

I. Fire Access. If a lot does not have access for emergency vehicles from a street or private easement which meets the requirements or standards of the engineering design standards manual, such access shall be provided from the nearest existing opened street right-of-way. Any existing street must also meet these requirements, unless the public works director approves an alternative that provides adequate emergency vehicle access.

J. Driveways. All curb cuts, driveways or other points of access or egress to a street shall be located and conform to the specifications in the engineering design standards manual. Private driveways located in the public right-of-way may be approved in limited instances and require a street development permit or minor activities permit, depending on the circumstances.

K. Intersections – Sight Obstruction. The number of local access streets intersecting with principal and minor arterials shall be held to the minimum. Intersection geometrics shall be as specified in the engineering design standards manual. Sight obstruction and sight distance requirements shall be as specified in the manual. 

L. Utilities. When utilities are installed in streets, trench backfill and street restoration shall be as specified in the engineering design standards manual and/or any applicable franchise agreement. Utilities such as telephone, power and cable television lines shall be placed underground where required in the engineering design standards manual.

M. Traffic Calming. Methods to calm traffic and provide for the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists on local access streets are encouraged as further described in the engineering design standards manual.

N. LID/RID No-Protest Agreements. Whenever the director (1) grants a waiver or modification of, or variance from, the engineering design standards, or (2) imposes a street development requirement that is less than the minimum standards based on an analysis of the particular project impacts, the director has full authority to require that the property owner(s) enter into a “no-protest agreement.” Where a property owner enters into a no-protest agreement with the city waiving the property owner’s right under Chapter 35.43 RCW et seq., to protest formation of a local improvement district (LID) or road improvement district (RID), the agreement must specify the improvements to be financed by the district and set forth the effective term of the agreement, which shall not exceed 10 years. The agreement shall be a burden upon and run with the title to the property subject to the development application, and shall be binding upon all successors and owners of the property. The agreement shall be recorded with the Jefferson County auditor. The agreement cannot require the property owner to waive objections to the amount of the owner’s individual assessment (including the determination of special benefits allocable to the property) or the right to appeal the final assessment to superior court. 

O. Maintenance of Streets. The city has a program for maintenance of open and approved streets. In the case of rights-of-way which were privately developed, the city will not maintain such right-of-way unless the city has “accepted” the right-of-way as a public street. A street will not be deemed to be accepted unless it is an approved street, or unless the street is devoted to a general use by and for the convenience of public travel as opposed to a local access street predominantly used by the owners of abutting properties which was constructed to minimum street standards at the time of installation of the street. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.150 Cutting significant trees and vegetation.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, no significant trees or vegetation, as defined in PTMC 12.04.030 and the engineering design standards manual, shall be pruned, cut down or removed from any city right-of-way, except as follows:

A. Emergency. The restrictions on cutting or removing a significant tree do not apply where the tree presents a clear and present danger or is otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare as determined by the public works director. In the event that any such trees are cut or removed by a utility, such utility shall notify the city of doing so within 24 hours of the time of the removal.

B. Existing Developed Area. A significant tree in an existing developed right-of-way may be cut down or removed with the prior approval of the public works director, or pursuant to a street development permit, utility development permit, ESA permit, or other city permit. Such permits shall include identification of all significant trees or vegetation on the site. Where significant trees or vegetation are identified, the public works director may condition or mitigate any significant adverse impacts of development through SEPA, the ESA ordinance, or under the authority granted in the chapter. 

C. Street Opening. Removal of the tree or vegetation cannot be avoided for the opening of the street and construction as set forth in the engineering design standards manual.

D. City Trimming/Pruning. This section shall not be construed to prevent the necessary trimming or pruning of significant trees by the city or under city permission or agreement for the purpose of protecting telephone, electrical or other aboveground utility wiring, for vehicle or other safety purposes or for the health of the trees. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.160 Waiver/modification of the required right-of-way and transportation improvement standards. 

A. Authority to Grant Waiver/Modification. The provisions of this section are intended to be a separate and distinct procedure from the zoning code variance procedures. Waivers and/or modifications of the standards of this chapter and/or the engineering design standards manual may be granted only upon meeting the criteria of subsection B of this section. Waivers may be initiated by the city or the developer pursuant to subsection D of this section, or by the public works director on his or her own initiative.

B. Criteria. The public works director may waive or modify applicable requirements contained in this title and/or the engineering design standards manual for paving, curb and gutter installation, storm drainage, design of structures and/or grading to future right-of-way grade, signs or other traffic control devices, landscaping, walkways, bikeways, sidewalks, on-street parking, driveways, surveys, engineering, street widening, cul-de-sacs/hammerheads, and/or utilities, when it is determined that the waiver or modification will not harm or will be beneficial to the public in general and that one or more of the following conditions are met:

1. Location in an environmentally sensitive area as determined by Chapter 19.05 PTMC, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees or vegetation makes widening and/or improving the street or right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

2. The existence of a structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes widening the street or right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

3. Widening and/or improving the street or right-of-way would eliminate street access to an existing lot.

4. Widening and/or improving the street or right-of-way would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where; (1) development standards cannot reasonably be met; or (2) under which the property owner will have no reasonable use of the property.

5. One or more structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the street or right-of-way, and the structure(s)’ condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the street or right-of-way unlikely.

6. Widening and/or improving the street or right-of-way is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot (for example due to an inability to meet the required maximum driveway slope).

7. Widening, paving or street frontage improvements are unnecessary because (1) the street is adequate for current and potential pedestrian and vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development, or (2) the development is on a street that is already developed at or near its zoned capacity and the improvements would provide little public benefit.

8. The specific design of the future street is currently unknown, making immediate improvement impractical and undesirable.

9. The installation of the required improvements would likely cause unacceptable significant adverse environmental impacts that may not be mitigated as determined by the SEPA official, and the waiver/modification would avoid such impacts.

10. There is insufficient street or right-of-way adjacent to the lot(s) and easement access cannot be obtained across private property.

11. There is no street or right-of-way adjacent to the lots and easement access can be obtained across private property.

12. In the case of engineered plans for street construction, when the public works department determines that engineering is unnecessary due to the limited extent of the improvements, where short or dead-end streets have no foreseeable need to be joined to the city’s existing street network at a future date, or where storm drainage concerns are not at issue or are a minor issue.

13. Application of the requirements of the engineering design standards manual as applied to a particular development would conflict with goals and policies of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan.

14. It is determined that development of the property will create impacts which can only be later mitigated through construction of an area-wide or neighborhood improvement and it would be unreasonable to require the full improvement as a condition of the development.

15. It is determined that the street frontage improvements required in the engineering design standards manual could best be accomplished by construction of area-wide improvements at a future date.

16. It is determined that requiring paving of an existing substandard street would be unreasonable because of the limited impacts caused by the proposed development.

17. It is determined that private streets or access easements can provide necessary vehicular access, including emergency vehicle access.

18. It is determined that emergency vehicle access is otherwise adequate.

C. Any waivers from the engineering requirement under this section do not exempt the developer from submitting plans which meet all other applicable specifications contained in the engineering design standards manual.

D. Application Requirements. The application for a waiver or modifications of the above listed standards shall be by written request to the city and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution. The application shall be made on a form provided by the city. The application shall specify which requirement(s) of this chapter and the engineering design standards manual are at issue and which of the condition(s) listed above can be met. It shall also contain a statement as to why the deviation from the required standards is necessary and why the waiver or modification sought will not harm or will be beneficial to the general public. 

E. Public Works Director’s Decision. The public works director will make a decision within 21 days of receipt of the application, subject to his or her notification to the applicant that additional time is needed to obtain further necessary information. The public works director’s decision shall be made in writing and shall be an administrative decision which may be appealed by the applicant only pursuant to Chapter 1.14 PTMC, upon payment of an appeal filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution.

F. Authority to Condition. The public works director may, in his or her discretion, condition the granting of the modification or waiver on the property owner(s) signing of a no-protest agreement to future formation of an LID or RID, as further set forth in PTMC 12.04.140N. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2578 § 1, 1997).


12.04.170 Variances.

A. Authority to Grant Variance. The public works director shall have the authority, under limited circumstances, to grant a variance from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that all variances under PTMC Titles 17 and 18 shall be processed and decided under the requirements of those titles.

B. Application Requests. The person(s) seeking a variance shall prepare and submit an application to the city on forms provided by the city and accompanied by a filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution. Upon receipt, the application shall first be reviewed for completeness. If the application is incomplete, the director shall promptly return it to the applicant and indicate the additional information needed to make the application complete.

C. Public Works Director’s Decision. Within 30 days of receipt of a complete application, the public works director shall make a determination to grant the variance, grant the variance under certain delineated conditions, or to deny the variance. The time for such determination may be continued to a later date as agreed to in writing by the applicant. 

D. Criteria. A variance may be from all or part of the requirements of this chapter, may require other standards to be satisfied by the applicant, and may be subject to any conditions which the public works director deems necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this title in the public interest, safety and welfare. In making his or her determination, the public works director may grant a variance only upon specific written findings of fact and conclusions showing that all of the following conditions exist:

1. The variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located; and

2. The variance is necessary because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; and

3. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located; and

4. The special circumstances of the subject property make the strict enforcement of the provisions of this title an unnecessary hardship to the property owner; and

5. The special circumstances of the subject property are not the result of the actions of the applicant; and

Article I. General Provisions


12.06.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the requirements and procedures for determining the consistency of proposed development projects with the transportation element of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan, including meeting the transportation concurrency management provisions of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).


12.06.020 Intent.

This chapter implements RCW 36.70A.070 which requires that cities establish level of service standards and ensure that level of service standards are met or that funding of adequate improvements or efforts to reduce the demand for the facilities or services is assured before new development is approved. The city-owned facilities covered by this section include roads, highways and transportation facilities. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).

Article II. Definitions


12.06.030 Definitions.

The definitions for administering transportation concurrency management are codified within PTMC 12.04.030, “Definitions,” of Chapter 12.04 PTMC, “Transportation and Rights-of-Way Improvement Standards.” (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).

Article III. Applicability and Standards


12.06.040 Applicability.

This chapter applies to applications for development permits that will create 20 or more new peak hour trips on any city-owned roadway/highway segment (i.e., excluding SR 20) or intersection. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).


12.06.050 Exemptions.

The following developments are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

A. In existing buildings, tenant improvements which do not increase the off-street parking requirement. 

B. Development that is vested prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter is exempt for the development approval for which vested status is achieved. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).


12.06.060 Level of service standards.

A. The level of service standards for roads and transportation facilities shall be measured in terms of the peak hour volume to capacity ratios (V/C), averaged over the screenline segments. For roadway screenlines connecting to the SR 20 corridor, the average V/C shall be no more than ____ [RESERVED]; for roadway screenlines on all other roadways, the average V/C shall be no more than ____ [RESERVED]. The city does not provide concurrency management for SR 20. Level of service for the SR 20 is established by the Washington State Department of Transportation.

B. The level of service standards for intersections shall be measured in terms of the number of signal cycles or elapsed time. Individual movements at each signalized intersection shall not exceed an average of _____ [RESERVED] cycle lengths or _____ [RESERVED] seconds of delay (whichever is less). Individual movements at unsignalized intersections shall not exceed an average of _____ [RESERVED] seconds of delay. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).

Article IV. Transportation Concurrency Management Review


12.06.070 Transportation concurrency management process.

A. The department of public works will administer the transportation concurrency management system.

B. A transportation concurrency review and determination shall be required for the issuance of any permit for developments that create 20 or more new peak hour trips on any roadway/highway screenline segment, except as provided by the exceptions.

C. If a development requires more than one development permit, the transportation concurrency determination shall occur prior to the issuance of the first development permit.

D. A transportation concurrency determination shall be required for a change in use or modification to an existing building or site if the new use or modification in combination with the existing use generates impacts as identified in subsection B of this section. For purposes of this chapter, a change in use or modification to an existing building will be subject to a transportation concurrency determination for the new increase in demand for the new facilities only. A transportation concurrency determination for a new increase in demand for facilities or services will be performed at the time a complete application for the new demand is received by the city.

E. No reservation of transportation capacity will be approved for a change in use which is otherwise not permitted pursuant to the city’s zoning code and official zoning map.

F. A transportation concurrency determination shall be valid as long as the development permit to which it applies is valid, and any change to the proposed development does not change the impact, as measured by the level of service; provided, that if the development has not received a building permit, and the development permit does not have an expiration date, then the concurrency determination will be valid for five years from the approval date of the development permit.

G. The impacts of new development will be measured in terms of the transportation capacity removed or added to the level of service standards defined in PTMC 12.06.060 and adopted in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan.

H. Any development subject to transportation concurrency review shall be granted concurrency approval, if, pursuant to this chapter, an adequate level of service will exist after the development’s transportation facility impacts are added to: (1) the sum of existing transportation facility usage, and (2) the cumulative impacts of all other development in the city for which development approval or transportation concurrency approval has been granted but which have not been built or occupied, and (3) the cumulative demand for new transportation facilities due to developments outside of the city’s boundaries. The capacity of the city’s transportation facilities for use in determining transportation concurrency shall include the planned capacity of the transportation projects in the capital facilities and utilities and transportation elements of the comprehensive plan and other adopted facility plans which are reasonably funded.

I. If transportation concurrency approval is granted, the city shall reserve the capacity required for the development at the time of the concurrency determination. This capacity shall not be returned to the system unless and until the application is, for whatever reason, denied, rejected, invalidated or abandoned; or the city determines that the reservation of capacity to be rescinded under the provisions of PTMC 12.06.090 (certificate of transportation concurrency). Reservation of capacity will only be granted if the development is determined by the city to have a complete application.

J. If the transportation concurrency determination results in a finding that the impacts of the proposed development will cause the city’s overall transportation facilities to fall below the adopted standards, the application for concurrency approval shall not be granted; provided, that the applicant may accept a single 90-day reservation of available capacity, and within the same 90-day period, amend the application so that one or more of the following conditions are met and made conditions of approval:

1. Mitigating measures needed to meet the level of service standards are identified in an impact study (e.g., approved traffic study), and the project development provides the financial commitment to guarantee the funding of the approved mitigating measures and the anticipated completion date of construction of the mitigating measures. For city-owned roads and transportation facilities, the completion of construction shall not be more than six years from the date of the development permit approval.

2. The applicant reduces the traffic impacts to achieve an acceptable level of service by a reduction of the size or intensity of land uses, delay for the committed facility construction, or phasing the development to match future facility construction.

3. The applicant reduces the impacts to achieve an acceptable level of service by scaling the project down, by reducing the demand for new facilities or by providing ways to utilize facilities that are not at capacity.

The city shall provide a written statement of the reason for denying an application under this section. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).


12.06.080 Transportation concurrency management appeals.

Any decision to approve, condition or deny a development proposal based on the requirements of this chapter may be appealed according to the appeal procedure for the permit or approval involved in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC and other regulations which may apply. The city shall reserve any available capacity required by a development during an appeal. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).

Article V. Transportation Concurrency Certification


12.06.090 Certificate of transportation concurrency.

A. A certificate of transportation concurrency shall be issued by the director for each application that is granted concurrency approval under this chapter.

B. Certificates of transportation concurrency shall be issued in the order of their review and approval. The purpose of this section is to enable applicants who are ready for approval to receive a certificate of transportation concurrency, even if their application was submitted after an earlier applicant. It is the city’s intent to treat applications on a “first-come, first-served” basis, but to use this section to avoid delays in approval of development caused by applicants who are unable to complete the review process due to their own action (or inaction).

C. Upon issuance of a certificate of transportation concurrency, the director shall reserve capacity on behalf of the applicant, and indicate the reservation on the certificate of transportation concurrency.

D. A certificate of transportation concurrency shall be valid for the same period of time as the development permit; provided, that concurrency must be achieved no later than six years from the issuance of the development permit.

E. No development shall be required to obtain more than one certificate of transportation concurrency, unless the applicant or subsequent owner proposes changes or modifications to the property location, density, intensity or land use that creates additional impacts on transportation facilities.

F. A certificate of transportation concurrency is valid only for a specified parcel on which the development will be built, and is valid only for subsequent development permits on the same parcel, and the new owners of the original parcel for which it was issued. A certificate of transportation concurrency cannot be transferred to a different parcel, and shall be limited to the uses, densities, and intensities for which it was originally issued.

G. Upon subdivision of a parcel that has obtained a certificate of transportation concurrency, the director shall replace the certificate of concurrency by issuing a separate certificate of transportation concurrency to each subdivided parcel, assigning to each a pro rata portion of the concurrency capacity rights of the original certificate. The director may modify such assignment upon petition of the owner, or may reject such petition. Any change of use of such subdivided parcels shall require a new determination of transportation concurrency.

H. A certificate of transportation concurrency shall expire if the underlying development permit is revoked by the director.

I. All development permits that require one or more transportation facilities to be provided shall condition the issuance of the permit, and any subsequent permit for the same development, on a financial commitment by the applicant, binding on subsequent owners, for the completion of such transportation facilities. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).

Article VI. Monitoring


12.06.100 Monitoring transportation concurrency.

The city shall monitor the cumulative impacts of new development by taking traffic counts annually on selected city-owned roads. Monitoring will be documented through the annual capacity statement. The annual capacity statement will include any transportation capacity allocated to development which is determined to be exempt under PTMC 12.06.050. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).

Article VII. General Administration


12.06.110 Fees.

The city shall charge a processing fee as set forth by council resolution to any individual or entity that requests a transportation concurrency determination. The processing fee shall be nonrefundable and nonassignable to any other fees. All such concurrency processing fees are to be paid in full upon application for concurrency determination. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).


12.06.120 Other authority.

Nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the city’s authority under the State Environmental Policy Act or any other source. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).


12.06.130 Severability.

If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter should be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter. (Ord. 2879 § 6.2, 2005).

E. Sales on streets and sidewalks shall be subject to Chapter 5.32 PTMC and shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 3017 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009).


12.10.020 Short-term permits.

A. Short-term street use permits may be issued for those activities that will use the street, sidewalk and/or public right-of-way, are activities of short-term duration, typically, for 72 hours or less, and which do not involve the physical disturbance or alteration of the street, sidewalk and/or public right-of-way. Permits may be issued for longer periods, such as for construction activity.

B. This type of use may involve the temporary disruption of pedestrian and vehicular traffic or access to private property. The type of use may also require approval of specific routes, locations, dates, methods to ensure public safety, traffic control, inspections, police or fire support, and clean up. Some proposed uses of the street may require the applicant to provide comprehensive liability insurance.

C. Activities requiring a short-term street use permit include, but are not limited to, the following:

A-1 House Moves: special use of the street and/or public right-of-way to move houses or other oversize and overweight materials and structures at specific times and locations.

A-2 Temporary Street Closures: activities that require temporary closures of streets, lanes or sidewalks for commercial loading/unloading, construction storage or repair purposes if not approved as part of a building or street development permit.

A-3 Construction Site Structures: structures related to construction sites such as scaffolds, barricades, buildings, walls, elevators, cranes, lifts, etc., that are on, over or under the public right-of-way; provided, no permit is required if the use is approved in connection with the issuance of a building permit. No permit is required for minor maintenance and repair, where the temporary use involves only a ladder (or similar).

A-4 Temporary Storage of Materials Related to Construction: use of public roads to store construction-related materials in support of ongoing construction activities. (Ord. 3017 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009).


12.10.030 Annual permits.

A. Annual street use permits may be issued for those activities that will use the public right-of-way over the longer term, which do not involve the physical disturbance or alteration of the surface of the street or sidewalk, and which do not substantially or unduly block the use of the street or sidewalk by pedestrians or vehicular traffic, such as vending facilities, sidewalk cafes, off-street structures and other uses that require longer-term authorization. These activities typically require inspections, traffic safety devices, performance bonds, comprehensive liability insurance, legal documentation and, on occasion, public hearings before a permit can be issued.

B. Activities requiring an annual street use permit include but are not limited to the following:

B-1 Newspaper Sales and Private Mail/Parcel Boxes: commercial structures, other than individual U.S. Postal Service boxes, that use the street, sidewalk and/or public right-of-way for extended time periods for newspaper sales or the private collection of mail or parcels.

B-2 Waste Collection and Recycling Facilities: structures using the street, sidewalk and/or public right-of-way for extended time periods to collect recyclable materials.

They are authorized to develop standards and guidelines, consistent with and to implement the requirements of this chapter.

A. Applicants for street use permits shall complete an application form, and provide all relevant activity or project information. The applicant may have a need for more than one permit if multiple activities are occurring simultaneously.

B. A permit is required for each such use of the street and/or right-of-way unless the development services director approves one application for several related activities. (Ord. 3017 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009).


12.10.050 Regulations and city codes.

An applicant who applies for a street use permit for the activities listed above, and all other activities which require a street use permit, must comply with all applicable city, state and federal laws, ordinances, codes and regulations, including business licensing and requirements of Chapter 5.32 PTMC, Sales on Streets and Sidewalks. It shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant to obtain all permits or licenses required by other agencies. Applicants for an annual street use permit for a new private use of the public right-of-way must also obtain a street development permit if required by Chapter 12.04 PTMC (for example, if physical improvements in the right-of-way are constructed or altered). (Ord. 3017 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009).


12.10.060 Approval criteria – Short-term permits.

Applications for short-term street use permits may only be approved by the director of development services, with conditions that are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, welfare, and safety and to mitigate any impacts resulting from the use, if all of the following applicable criteria are successfully met:

A. The proposed short-term use shall not cause a physical disturbance or alteration of the street, sidewalk and/or public right-of-way.

B. If the proposed short-term use will cause a temporary disruption of pedestrian and vehicular traffic or access to private property, a plan that describes specific routes, locations, dates, methods to ensure public safety, traffic control, inspections, police or fire support, and clean up has been submitted and approved.

C. The proposed use must meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. (Ord. 3017 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009).


12.10.070 Approval criteria – Annual permits.

Applications for annual street use permits may only be approved by the director of development services, with conditions that are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, welfare, and safety and to mitigate any impacts resulting from the use, if all of the following applicable criteria are successfully met:

A. The proposed annual use shall not preclude or substantially or unduly hinder the continued use of an opened and developed street or sidewalk by pedestrians or vehicular traffic.

B. The proposed use must meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines.

C. Annual uses located within the historic district constitute “development” under Chapter 17.30 PTMC and shall be subject to design review consistent with the requirements of Chapter 17.30 PTMC. HPC and the director are authorized to develop procedures and guidelines for administrative review of permits.

D. The proposed annual use shall not block or substantially or unduly hinder public access to the shoreline and/or views of the shoreline from within the subject street.

E. The proposed annual use shall not block or substantially or unduly hinder access to adjacent properties.

C. Every ramp constructed under subsection A of this section, which serves one end of a crosswalk, shall be matched by another ramp at the other end of the crosswalk. However, no ramp shall be required at the other end of the crosswalk if there is no curb nor sidewalk at the other end of the crosswalk, nor shall any matching ramp constructed pursuant to this subsection require a subsequent matching ramp.

D. This section shall be supplemented and ancillary to all other state federal law, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, relating to sidewalk standards for access by the physically handicapped, as those laws currently exist or are later amended.

B. City Discretionary Contribution.

1. Where the property owner desires to remove and replace an existing sidewalk, the city may, in its discretion, participate on a 50-50 basis sharing the cost of removal and replacement, depending on funds available and the ranking of the repair on a priority basis, pursuant to subsection (B)(4) of this section. In general, the repair of existing failed sidewalks shall have priority over a similarly ranked new project.

2. If the property owner desires to participate in the removal and replacement of the poor sidewalk and public works funds are not available to participate on a 50-50 basis, then the public works department may remove the existing sidewalk material, if the owner will install the new sidewalk to city specifications.

3. If a sidewalk repair involves city action ordering the property owner to repair the sidewalk, all costs associated with that work shall be borne by the property owner, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

4. Sidewalk Comparison Rating Form. The public works department shall formulate a sidewalk comparison rating form which is to be used whenever it is necessary to rank sidewalks for repair, maintenance, and new construction. This process shall be used as necessary, based upon requests by property owners. The work accomplished during any particular year shall be subject to the available funding from the city council. (Ord. 2578 § 4, 1997; Ord. 2474 § 1, 1995).


12.12.230 Limitation on abutting owner’s obligation under this chapter.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, an abutting owner shall not be charged with the costs of reconstruction under this chapter if the reconstruction is required to correct deterioration of or damage to the sidewalk that is the direct result of actions by the city or its agents, or to correct deterioration of or damage to the sidewalk that is the direct result of the failure of the city to enforce its ordinances. Subject to this limitation, the cost of reconstructing or repairing existing sidewalks may devolve upon the abutting property as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 2578 § 4, 1997).

D. City Police Department. The police department shall review applications to determine whether the proposed vacation will hinder the efficient delivery of police protection for the area in which the street is to be vacated.

E. City Fire Department. The fire department shall review applications to determine whether the proposed vacation will hinder the efficient delivery of fire protection for the area in which the street is to be vacated.

F. Emergency Medical Services. Purveyors of emergency medical service shall review applications to determine whether the proposed vacation will hinder the efficient delivery of emergency services to the area in which the street is to be vacated.

 G. Other Public Services. In such cases as the DSD director may deem appropriate, the city shall seek comments and recommendations from public transportation (transit) service providers, the U.S. Postal Service, private utility providers, and the city’s solid waste utility manager.

H. City Development Services Department. The city DSD shall review applications for conformance with the goals and policies contained in the city comprehensive plan and other adopted city plans and the review criteria contained in this chapter. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2671 § 4, 1998; Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 2256 § 1, 1991; Ord. 1992 § 1, 1984; Ord. 1802 § 4, 1978).

In addition, at the time the city council, or a committee thereof, recommends granting a vacation petition, an additional fee in the amount of $750.00 shall be paid to cover appraisal costs for a street, alley or public place. In the event an appraisal cost is less than the payment therefor, the vacation compensation payable to the city shall be reduced by the difference between the fee and the actual cost or, in the alternative, such difference shall be refunded. (Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 2440 § 2, 1995; Ord. 1992 § 2, 1984).

The dimensions of the easement shall conform with the city’s adopted engineering design standards); and

F. That the proposed vacated street, right-of-way or alley is not required as a current or anticipated bicycle, pedestrian or equestrian pathway, trail or sidewalk corridor (suitable trail easements may be required to satisfy this criterion. The dimensions of the easement shall conform with the city’s adopted engineering design standards); and

G. That the proposed vacation will not increase the potential for disturbance of an environmentally sensitive area (ESA), as defined by Chapter 19.05 PTMC, including ESAs situated within and outside of the street, right-of-way or alley proposed for vacation; and

H. That, in the case of the proposed vacation of any portion of a street or alley which abuts a body of fresh or salt water, the proposed vacation meets the criteria and has been reviewed and approved in accordance with RCW 35.79.035, as now or hereafter amended. (Ord. 2945 § 2.1, 2007; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2671 § 5, 1998; Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 2256 § 3, 1991). 


12.20.070 Legislative action.

The city council, upon receipt of a street vacation application, shall fix a time, by formal resolution, of not more than 60 days and not fewer than 20 days from the date of said resolution, when a public hearing will be held. The city council, on the date of the public hearing, shall review the recommendation of the DSD and all other testimony in support of, or opposition to, the proposed street vacation. The city council shall make a decision to grant or deny petitions for street vacations by ordinance; provided, that such ordinance may retain an easement or the right to exercise and grant easements over vacated property; and provided, further, that the proposed street to be vacated, or part thereof, does not abut on a body of salt or fresh water, unless such vacation meets the requirements set forth in RCW 35.79.035, as now or hereafter amended. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 2256 § 4, 1991). 


12.20.080 Variances.

A. Variance Request. Variances from the review criteria set forth in PTMC 12.20.060 may be permitted under certain circumstances; provided, that a variance request is submitted in writing and attached to the street vacation application. 

B. Findings. The city council shall only grant a variance if it makes the following findings on variance requests: 

1. That there exist extraordinary conditions or unusual circumstances peculiar to the property or structure thereon, not the result of the action of the applicant; and 

2. That the literal enforcement of the review criteria would result in undue and unnecessary hardship; and 

3. That justice could be done and the public interest secured by the granting of a suitable variance. 

C. City Council Action. In granting variances, the city council may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the review criteria so varied. (Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 2256 § 5, 1991; Ord. 1802 § 7, 1978). 


12.20.090 Compensation for vacation.

A. All ordinances vacating any street, right-of-way or alley, or any part thereof, shall provide that the same shall not become effective until the owners of property abutting upon the street, right-of-way or alley, or part thereof, so vacated, pay to the city one-half of the appraised value of the area so vacated, or the full appraised value of the area vacated if the street or alley has been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for 25 years or more, or the full appraisal value if the city acquired the right-of-way other than by dedication; provided, however, that in lieu of payment of appraised value, the city council, in its discretion, may authorize and accept dedication or conveyance of real property to the city in exchange for the vacated street, right-of-way or alley. In the event the city council accepts such property exchange, the exchanged properties shall be for use by the city for transportation, (motorized and nonmotorized) circulation, utility and/or stormwater retention and control purposes. Frequently flooded areas, wetland areas, natural drainage corridors, and areas which may serve local or regional stormwater control purposes are considered properties having stormwater retention and control purposes.

B. In considering and approving applications proposing a property exchange as compensation in lieu of appraised value, the city council may waive the requirement that the applicant obtain an appraisal; provided, that qualified public works personnel (as defined in PTMC 12.20.100) provide a written determination that the value of property received will be equal to or greater than the value of the right-of-way vacated. In cases where this determination is not made at the time the city council considers the application, the city council’s decision approving a street, right-of-way or alley vacation application shall be conditioned upon this determination. The “value received” may include intangible values or benefits received by the city through implementation of comprehensive plan goals and policies (including goals and policies of the city’s “functional” and “subarea” plans) and provision of other public health, safety and welfare benefits to the city.

C. One hundred percent of the revenue received by the city as compensation for the area vacated must be dedicated to a reserved transportation system improvement account for the purchase of rights-of-way or transportation facility easements within the city. (Ord. 2776 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2671 § 6, 1998; Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 1992 § 3, 1984). 


12.20.100 Appraisals.

A. Except as provided in PTMC 12.20.090 (B), the public works director is authorized to obtain or require the applicant to obtain an appraisal from a qualified, independent appraiser. The appraiser shall appraise the fair market value pursuant to customary industry standards for real property appraisals of such streets, rights-of-way or alleys as are approved for vacation after hearing by the city council. All applicants shall be required to pay the full cost of an independent, qualified appraisal prior to the city council adopting an ordinance formally vacating the street or right-of-way. 

 B. Under circumstances provided in PTMC 12.20.090(B), qualified public works department personnel may be used to make the required appraisals without cost to the applicant. For the purposes of this section, “qualified public works department personnel” means employee(s) or contractors of the public works department who have work experience as professional appraisers or adequate experience in real estate transactions in the local real estate market to enable the public works employee(s) to make a reliable, independent and well-informed determination of comparable market values of real property. Under circumstances as provided in PTMC 12.20.090 (B), the finance director shall provide written approval of all appraisals conducted by qualified public works department personnel. (Ord. 2671 § 7, 1998; Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 1992 § 3, 1984). 


12.20.110 Payment of compensation.

Upon securing an appraisal of the value of the street, right-of-way or alley area to be vacated as provided in this chapter, the development services department (DSD) director shall notify the petitioner that payment of such appraised value, deducting therefrom any appraisal fee coverage not previously refunded to petitioner, may be made to the finance director for deposit in the appropriate fund or funds, as directed by the city council. The finance director shall make a written report of such payment to the DSD director. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2671 § 8, 1998; Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 1992 § 3, 1984). 


12.20.120 Recording ordinance.

As required by law, a certified copy of the ordinance vacating a street, alley or public place, or part thereof, shall be recorded by the city clerk in the office of the Jefferson County auditor, upon receipt by the city of all fees and compensation required hereunder. (Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 1992 § 3, 1984). 


12.20.130 Decision final.

Any decision, finding, ruling, order or determination of the city council made pursuant to street vacations provided for in this chapter shall be final on the effective date of an ordinance giving effect thereto, and no action to set aside or modify the same shall be brought in the superior court or other tribunal unless the action shall be filed within 30 days from the effective date of such decision, finding, ruling, order or determination. (Ord. 2578 § 6, 1997; Ord. 2206 § 4, 1990; Ord. 1990 § 4, 1984; Ord. 1802 § 7.20, 1978).

A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to define the procedures for executing 15-year contracts between the city and developers for private construction of street improvements by providing means for (1) partial cost recovery through a charge to later developers who were not required to install similar street projects because they were already provided for by the original developer, and (2) the establishment of benefit areas defining which properties are subject to such charges and reimbursement shares based upon the benefit to the property. This chapter is also intended to implement Chapter 35.72 RCW, et seq., as it now reads, or is later amended.

B. Intent. It is intended that the processing of street latecomer agreements under this chapter be independent from the project permit time lines contained in PTMC Title 20. (Ord. 2578 § 8, 1997; Ord. 2548 § 1, 1996).


12.26.020 Definitions.

Repealed by Ord. 2578. (Ord. 2548 § 1, 1996).


12.26.030 Authorization – Minimum project size.

A. Authorization. Any property owner or developer of property located within the city limits who uses private funds to construct street improvements may apply to the city to establish a street latecomer agreement in order to recover a portion of the costs from owner(s) of property benefited by such improvements when such owner(s) later apply for permits to develop their property.

B. Minimum Project Size. To be eligible for a street latecomer agreement, the estimated total cost of the street improvements must be at least $2,500, to be adjusted annually in accordance with the Engineering News Record Index (“ENR”). The determination of eligibility shall be made by the public works director, based upon contractor bids, engineering or architectural estimates, or other information determined by the director to be a reliable basis for estimating cost. The determination of the director shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 2578 § 8, 1997; Ord. 2548 § 1, 1996).


12.26.040 Application – Design standards/cost estimates – Combined street and utility latecomer agreement.

A. Application Form – Fee. The application must be on a form provided by the city and accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee in an amount as set forth by council resolution, except as provided under subsection D below for combined utility and street latecomer agreements. The application shall be accompanied by the following:

1. Cost Estimate/Design Standards. The street improvements design shall be based on PTMC Title 12, the engineering design standards manual, and any requirements or modifications as recommended or required during or following the preapplication conference for development review. Based on this information, the applicant shall submit with the application a statement from a licensed contractor or engineer containing an itemized estimate of the total projected cost of the street projects, including property acquisition, acquisition of easements and/or right-of-way, contract administration, grading, construction, paving, installation of curbs, streets, gutters, storm drainage, sidewalks or bike lanes incorporated as part of the street improvements, street lights, traffic signals, signs, and planting strips, and other similar improvements as required by city street standards.

2. A map depicting the boundaries of a proposed assessment reimbursement area and consisting of those properties adjacent to the street improvements for which similar improvements would be required as a prerequisite to development, each parcel of property within such area, and the street improvements in relation to such property.

3. Copies of executed deeds and/or easements in which the applicant is the grantee for all property necessary for the installation of such street projects.

4. The name and mailing address of each owner of record of property within the proposed benefit area, together with the legal description and the size and the county assessor’s tax number for each property. Such information must be certified as complete and accurate by the applicant.

B. Additional Requirements. When deemed necessary in the discretion of the public works director to determine the benefit area and reimbursement charge, the city may also require that the application be accompanied by any or all of the following:

1. A proposed benefit area based on an assessment of which parcels adjacent to the improvements would require similar street improvements as a condition of development, including, if requested by the city, a special benefit analysis prepared by a certified MAI appraiser.

2. A proposed assessment reimbursement roll stating a proposed assessment for each parcel of property within the proposed assessment reimbursement area, to be determined by apportioning the total street project costs among such parcels on the basis of the benefit of the project to each such parcel of property.

C. Notice Requirement. Throughout the term of the agreement the developer/property owner shall notify the city, in writing, of any change of his or her name(s) or address(es). Absent such notice, the city is not responsible for locating any developer/property owner entitled to benefits under the street latecomer agreement. The developer/property owner may not assign any rights under the street latecomer agreement without written notification to the city. Absent such notification, any assignment of rights under the agreement shall have no effect on the obligations of the city under the latecomer agreement.

D. Unclaimed Funds. Any funds not claimed by the developer/property owner within 180 days from the date collected shall become the property of the city. Before the expiration of the 180 days, the city shall send to the developer/property owner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a final notice of the city’s intent to deposit the funds as city revenue. If the city does not receive a response by the expiration of the 180 days, the funds shall be revenue to the city street fund or as allowed by law. (Ord. 2578 § 8, 1997; Ord. 2548 § 1, 1996).

13.01.010 Intent – Purpose. 

A. It is hereby found that the acquisition, construction, and improvement of utilities to serve new developments in the city of Port Townsend and in the out-of-city water service areas are a major burden upon the city utility. The city of Port Townsend, as an urban growth area and as a utility provider expects to experience an increasing intensity of land use and population growth which creates large demands for city services, including utilities, that existing and projected city utility funds are inadequate to meet the public’s projected utility needs; and that failure to ensure that utility improvements are made as utility demand increases causes safety problems or interferes with the comfort and repose of the public.

B. The purpose of this title is to establish the authority of the public works director to impose conditions upon development to mitigate the problems caused by a particular development or use. The basis for this authority comes from the following statutes: Article XI, § 11 of the State Constitution; PTMC Title 18 and Chapter 58.17 RCW (Subdivisions), Chapter 19.04 PTMC and 43.21C RCW (SEPA), Chapter 19.05 PTMC (ESA ordinance), RCW 35A.63.100 and 35A.47.020, the International Fire Code (adopted in PTMC Title 16), and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws.

C. This title applies to all water, sewer and stormwater utility development within the city of Port Townsend and all water utility development in Port Townsend’s out-of-city water service areas.

D. This title provides uniform, predictable standards for property development throughout Port Townsend and in the out-of-city water service areas. This title is further intended to implement the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan. This title is intended to require compliance with the city’s engineering design standards manual for public improvements necessary to serve all areas of the city and the out-of-city water service areas, to ensure that appropriate public services and facilities, including utilities, are provided concurrently with development in accordance with the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, and to ensure that all properties in the city uniformly comply with all regulatory standards and requirements to protect public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the built environment. Additionally, this title is intended to provide for the equitable sharing of improvement costs.

E. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the administrative procedures for water, sewer and stormwater system development. All of the provisions in this chapter apply to water, sewer and stormwater utilities. (Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).

13.01.120 Tiering – Expenditure of public funds.

As set forth in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan, the city has adopted a tiering structure for the phasing or prioritizing of capital improvements in a manner designed to promote orderly growth and development and efficient use of city resources. Accordingly, if the location, nature, and/or timing of a proposed development necessitates the expenditure of public funds in excess of those currently available in the six-year CIP for the necessary utility improvements and provision has not otherwise been made to meet the mitigation of direct impact requirements as provided in this title, the city may refuse to approve or grant a permit for development pursuant to the concurrency requirement of the Growth Management Act. As an alternative, the city (1) will consider alternatives to the proposal so that the need for utility improvements is lessened; (2) may provide the developer with the option of bearing the full cost of the required utility improvements; or (3) may consider the development for approval upon alternative arrangements for financing of the necessary improvements, such as no-protest LID covenants or latecomer agreements. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.01.130 Waiver/modification of the required utility improvement standards.

A. The provisions of this subsection are intended to be a separate and distinct procedure from the zoning code variance procedures.

Waivers may be initiated by the developer pursuant to subsection C of this section or by the city.

B. The public works director may waive or modify applicable requirements for utilities, when it is determined that the waiver or modification will not harm or will be beneficial to the public in general, and when one or more of the following conditions are met:

1. Location in an environmentally sensitive area, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees makes compliance with engineering design standards manual impractical or undesirable.

2. The existence of a structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes compliance with engineering design standards manual impractical.

3. The installation of the required improvements would likely cause unacceptable significant adverse environmental impacts that may not be mitigated as determined by the city’s SEPA official and the waiver/modification would avoid such impacts.

4. Hydraulic concerns, topography of the site, or no foreseeable future need makes utility main extensions through the property to the next intersection unreasonable.

5. In the case of existing on-site septic systems, where topography, system deficiencies, or technical difficulties create problems with connecting to the city’s sewer system.

6. In the case of engineered plans for utility installations, when the public works department determines that engineering is unnecessary due to the limited extent of the improvements, the constraints of the existing system, or where short, dead-end extensions have no foreseeable need to be looped into the city’s existing system at a future date. Any waivers from the engineering requirement do not exempt the developer from submitting plans which meet all other applicable specifications contained in the engineering design standards manual.

7. In the case of stormwater drainage plans, such plans may not be required when the developer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the public works director that the proposed activity or development:

a. Will not adversely impact the water quality conditions of any affected receiving bodies of water; and

b. Will not alter the surface discharge location, alter the drainage pattern on adjoining properties, alter drainage patterns, increase the discharge or cause any other adverse effects in the drainage area; and

c. Will not alter the subsurface drainage patterns, flow rates, and discharge points, or result in any significant adverse effects to property or residents.

8. The installation of the required improvements as applied to the particular development is in conflict with the goals and policies of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan.

C. The application for a waiver or modifications of the above listed standards shall be by written request to the public works director and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution. The application shall be made on a form provided by the public works director. The application shall specify which requirement(s) of this title and the engineering design standards manual are at issue and which of the condition(s) listed above can be met. It shall also contain a statement as to why the deviation from the required standards is minor or insubstantial and why the waiver or modification sought will not harm or will be beneficial to the general public. 

D. The public works director will make a decision within 21 days of receipt of the request, subject to his or her notification to the applicant that additional time is needed to obtain further necessary information. The public works director’s decision shall be made in writing and is an administrative decision which may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 1.14 PTMC, upon payment of an appeal filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution.

E. The public works director may at his or her discretion condition the granting of a waiver on the property owner signing a no-protest agreement to future formation of a local improvement district (“LID”). (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.01.140 Utility variances.

A. The public works director shall have the authority, under limited circumstances, to grant a variance from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that all variances under PTMC Titles 17 and 18 shall be processed and decided under the requirements of those titles. 

B. The person(s) seeking a variance shall prepare and submit an application to the city on forms provided by the city and accompanied by a filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution.

C. Upon receipt, the application shall first be reviewed for completeness. If the application is incomplete, the director shall promptly return it to the applicant and indicate the additional information needed to make the application complete.

D. Within 30 days of receipt of a complete application, the public works director shall make a determination to grant the variance, grant the variance under specified circumstances, or to deny the variance. The time for such determination may be continued to a later date as agreed to by the applicant. 

E. A variance may be from all or part of the requirements of this title, may require other standards to be satisfied by the applicant, and may be subject to any conditions which the public works director deems necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this title in the public interest, safety and welfare. In making his or her determination, the public works director may grant a variance only upon specific written findings of fact showing that all of the following conditions exist:

1. That special conditions exist with respect to the land or area such as size, shape, topography, location, density, traffic, greenbelts, open space, character of neighborhood, character of the environment or other factors not generally applicable to other lands or areas, such that the improvement requirements would be unnecessary, inappropriate or unreasonably burdensome;

2. The special circumstances of the subject property make the strict enforcement of the provisions of this title an unnecessary hardship to the property owner;

3. That the special conditions do not result from actions of the applicant;

4. That granting the variance will not confer a special privilege to the applicant denied to other similarly situated landowners;

5. That the variance would not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, or to other properties or improvements in the area or to the traveling public;

6. That the applicant has set forth sufficient reasons to justify granting the variance;

7. That the variance will be consistent with the purpose and intent of this title and would not establish a precedent for subsequent variance requests which could diminish the effect of this title in furthering these purposes; 

8. The variance is consistent with the goals and policies of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan;

9. The variance is the minimum necessary to fulfill the purpose and the need of the applicant; and

10. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably will not be an element of consideration before the decisionmaker.

F. The public works director’s decision shall be made by written findings and conclusions and is an administrative decision which may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 1.14 PTMC, upon payment of an appeal filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.01.150 No-protest agreements.

The public works director may require that property owners enter into a “no-protest agreement” where it is determined that development of the property will create impacts which can only be later mitigated through construction of an areawide or neighborhood improvement and it would be unreasonable to require the full improvement as a condition of the development. Where a property owner enters into a no-protest agreement with the city waiving the property owner’s right under Chapter 35.43 RCW et seq., to protest formation of a local improvement district, the agreement must specify the improvements to be financed by the district and set forth the effective term of the agreement, which shall not exceed 10 years. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.01.160 Liability of city.

This title shall not be construed as imposing on the city or any city official or employee any liability or responsibility for damages to any person or property injured by the performance of any work done under a utility development permit; nor does the city or any city official or employee assume any such liability or responsibility by reason of inspections authorized by the provisions of this chapter, the issuance of any permit, or the approval of any work. This title is for benefit of the city of Port Townsend and not for any individual property owner or citizen. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).

13.03.010 Purpose.

Pursuant to the authority provided in RCW 35.92.025, the city of Port Townsend has determined that it is reasonable and in the public interest to enact and impose a system development charge (SDC) for the purpose of recovering a proportionate share of the actual and projected capital costs of water and sewer facilities from those properties within the utility service areas which, as a part of their development and use, create the need for those facilities. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.020 Equivalent residential unit defined.

For the purposes of this code, one “equivalent residential unit” or “ERU” is defined as a water service connection to a residential unit, commercial use or industrial use, with a five-eighths-inch or three-quarter-inch meter. Larger connections to the city’s water system will be referred to in terms of “equivalent residential units” for purposes of determining an equitable proportionate amount for SDCs. A method for calculation of the equivalent residential units for hookups larger than one ERU is included in PTMC 13.03.050. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.030 Water system development charge.

A. The city has evaluated the capital cost of the city’s existing water system and the projected cost to expand the general facilities to meet the projected needs associated with new and expanded needs of the water system customers. The general facilities include source of supply, treatment, storage, transmission and major regional pumping facilities. 

B. A one-time SDC for each new customer shall be assessed based upon the customer’s fair and equitable share of the general facilities. The SDC shall be determined by multiplying the total number of ERUs for the service(s) to be installed by $3,508 as of January 15, 2015, and by $4,494 as of July 1, 2015.

C. If a local improvement district pays for any of the general facilities described above, they may be eligible for an appropriate credit to the SDC. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2621 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2491 § 1, 1995; Ord. 2434 § 3, 1994; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.040 Sewer system development charge.

A. The city has evaluated the capital cost of the city’s existing sewer system and the cost to expand the general facilities to meet the projected needs associated with new and expanded needs of sewer system customers. The general facilities include the interceptor system, major regional pumping facilities and the wastewater treatment facility, outfall, compost facility and associated facilities necessary to treat and dispose of the wastewater.

B. A one-time SDC for each new customer shall be assessed based on the customer’s fair and equitable share of the general facilities. The SDC shall be determined by multiplying the total number of ERUs for the service(s) to be installed by $3,045 as of January 15, 2015, and by $3,758 as of July 1, 2015, for domestic strength wastewater.

C. If a local improvement district pays for any of the general facilities described above, they may be eligible for an appropriate credit to the SDC. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2621 § 2, 1997; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2491 § 2, 1995; Ord. 2434 § 4, 1994; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.050 Equivalent residential unit factors.

A. The ERU factors for determining the proportional equivalent of various sizes of water meters shall be in accordance with the following table:

	 	Water Meter Equivalent Factor (ERU)	Wastewater Meter Equivalent Factor (ERU)

	3/4" meter	 1.0	1.0

	1" meter 	2.5	1.4

	1-1/4" meter 	3.75	1.6

	1-1/2" meter 	5.0	1.8

	1-3/4" meter 	6.5	2.4

	2" meter 	8.0	2.9

	3" meter 	15.0	11.0

	4" meter 	25.0	14.0

	6" meter 	50.0	21.0

	8" meter 	80.0	29.0

B. If the wastewater strength exceeds the SIC number one criteria, the SDC shall be adjusted to reflect the higher cost associated with treating high strength waste. The high strength ERU formula is:

	(0.38(flow of customer)/(flow of Std. ERU))+(0.387(BOD of customer)/(BOD of Std. ERU))+(0.233(TSS of customer)/(TSS of Std. ERU)) = Equivalent ERU

	where: 	flow of Standard ERU is assumed to be 5,236 gallons per month

	 	BOD of Standard ERU is assumed to be 14 pounds per month

	 	TSS of Standard ERU is assumed to be 14 pounds per month

C. If the actual water meter size installed is increased to improve customer service, provide for fire sprinkler installation, or if the water meter size used to establish the sewer SDC overestimates the volume of wastewater discharged to the city sewer system (for example, on-site recycling or irrigation), the director of public works shall determine the appropriate ERU based upon the typical benefits the customer receives from the general facilities of the water and sewer system. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.060 System development charge in addition to other charges.

The system development charge for water and sewer imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to any permit fees or charges imposed by council resolution, any connection or tap charges for the actual cost of connecting to the city’s water and/or sewer systems, system extension and replacement costs, and to all other charges or costs imposed by ordinance or agreement. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.070 Collection of system development charges.

A. SDCs must be paid at the time a water and/or sewer connection is requested. For purposes of this section, a “connection” means the day the city receives a complete application for service as provided for in Chapter 13.13 PTMC. The installation of additional infrastructure, such as water or sewer main extensions, replacements, or other system improvements that are required as part of a development or permits, even if the systems are charged for testing purposes, does not constitute a “connection.” 

B. Charges so collected shall be used solely for capital improvements to the system to which the charge is applicable. No service connection to the sewer and water system shall be made until all SDCs have been paid. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2392 § 1, 1994; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.080 System development charge credit.

A. The owner or previous owner of a property that has been assessed through a local improvement district or through a special assessment for water or sewer general facilities shall be given a credit towards payment of the SDC calculated under this chapter. The credit shall be determined by prorating the current SDC as the required share against the previously paid assessment for identified general facilities. The ENR index for each time period shall be the method of establishing the value of the amount previously paid.

B. For existing customers that upgrade or expand their system ERU requirements, the customer shall receive credit for the previous ERU for which an SDC was paid. No credit for reducing an ERU demand will be granted. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.090 System development charge adjustment.

The SDC shall be adjusted each year on January 1st, according to the Seattle Area Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index (ENR), unless otherwise adjusted based on an evaluation of the cost of constructing the general facilities. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.100 Penalty for unauthorized hookup.

In the event any connection to the city water or sewer system is made without paying the fees required by this chapter, the owners of the property to which the connection is made shall be required to pay a fine in the amount of 10 percent of the applicable SDC. Utility service shall be terminated until all fees and penalties owing have been paid. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2390 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2380 § 1, 1993).


13.03.110 System development charge deferrals for low-income housing.

A. Program Established. In accordance with policy direction from the Port Townsend comprehensive plan, the city may allow deferral of payment of system development charges (SDCs) for a private or public nonprofit organization which is developing or constructing housing units for low-income households.

B. See PTMC 3.36.011 for program details. (Ord. 3235 § 4 (Exh. D), 2019; Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 3052 § 1 (Exh. A § 2), 2011; Ord. 2910 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2768 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2734 § 1, 2000).


13.03.115 Deferral of fees.

The city manager is authorized to defer fees for projects that the city manager determines promote substantial additional private sector jobs and/or leverage private sector investment so that the city’s tax base is substantially increased as a result of such project. The deferral shall:

A. Be on such terms and with such security (including recorded restrictive covenant or other security) as determined by the city manager that protects the payment of the fee;

B. Not exceed a period of deferral of more than two years, or sale of property, whichever occurs first;

C. Not include deferral of any costs of notices, publication and other costs to the city;

D. Include repayment in full with interest thereon at a rate commensurate with the annual one-year U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, computed annually on unpaid balances. Interest calculated pursuant to this section shall not be compounded. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2877 § 1, 2004).


13.03.120 Exemptions.

A. Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). All ADUs located within the city limits which have been permitted and approved in accordance with PTMC 17.16.020 are exempt from the requirement to pay SDCs pursuant to this chapter.

B. Properties Not Connected to the City’s Wastewater System. All properties which are not connected to the city’s wastewater system shall be exempt from the requirement to pay SDCs upon connection to the system, pursuant to this chapter; provided, that the property owner demonstrates the following:

1. The property owner and/or the occupants of the property have paid monthly wastewater service fees on a regular monthly basis, commencing any time during 1993; and

2. The property owner and/or the occupants of the property continue to make such payments until connection of the property to the wastewater system is made; and

3. If such payments have been made in the past (commencing in 1993) but were discontinued for any reason, in lieu of paying SDCs for connection to the wastewater system, the property owner may pay all unpaid accumulated monthly wastewater service fees, plus interest. (Ord. 3117 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2736 § 1, 2000).

13.04.010 Purpose – Intent.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to define the rules and regulations for executing 15‑year contracts between the city and developers for private construction of municipal water, sewer or storm drainage improvements by providing means for (1) partial cost recovery through a charge to later users who did not contribute to the capital costs and (2) the establishment of benefit areas defining which properties are subject to such charges. This chapter is also intended to implement Chapters 35.91, 35.92, and other provisions of the Revised Code of Washington, as it now reads, or is later amended.

B. Intent. It is intended that the processing of utility latecomer agreements under this chapter be independent from the regulatory reform time lines contained in PTMC Title 20. Further, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any city obligation to subsequently serve water to property within a reimbursement area if that property is removed from the city’s out‑of‑city water service area during the term of the latecomer agreement.

The final determination of the public works director shall be in writing.

C. Appeal. The final determination of the public works director is an administrative decision that may be appealed by an applicant. The appeal must be filed with the public works department within 15 calendar days of the date the final determination is mailed to the applicant. The procedures set forth in Chapter 1.14 PTMC shall apply to any appeal. The appeal must be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution. Any decision of the public works director not appealed from shall be final at the time made. In reviewing a final determination, the city council (or hearing examiner) shall apply the criteria set forth above, and shall uphold the administrative decision of the public works director, unless evidence clearly demonstrates that the criteria have been satisfied. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2805 § 1, 2002; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.060 Assessment reimbursement area and charge – Appeal.

A. Reimbursement Area Formula. The public works director shall formulate the benefit reimbursement area for all approved applications based upon the following:

1. The benefit reimbursement area shall be based upon a determination of which property owners did not contribute to the original costs of the improvement and whose parcels are located so that they are adjacent to the improvements, or are likely to require a service connection to the improvements based on city codes and standards; provided, however, that the public works director has the authority to remove from the benefit area those properties which are later developed but which do not subsequently tap into or use the water or sewer facilities. The applicant/property owner is not entitled to reimbursement for lots that are adjacent to the improvements if those lots are owned by the applicant/property owner at the time they apply for the utility latecomer agreement or at the time the utility improvements are constructed.

2. The estimated amount of the reimbursement charge shall be established so that each property will pay a fair, pro rata share of the cost of construction of the water, sewer, and/or storm drainage improvements, which is proportional to the benefits which accrue to the property, determined at the city’s sole discretion on an acre, front footage, equivalent water meter, or other equitable basis.

B. Notice to Property Owners. A notice containing the benefit reimbursement area boundaries, preliminary charges, and a description of the property owner’s rights to request a public hearing before the city council with regard to the area boundaries and special benefits and charge shall be forwarded by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the property owners within the proposed benefit reimbursement area. The public works department will maintain in its files a certificate of mailing.

C. Appeal/Request for Hearing.

1. Any appeal requesting a hearing pursuant to subsection B of this section must be filed within 15 calendar days of the date the notice is mailed to the property owners. The procedures set forth in Chapter 1.14 PTMC shall apply to any appeal. Notice of the hearing shall be given to all affected property owners. The appeal must be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount set forth by council resolution. Any decision of the public works director not appealed from shall be final at the time made. In reviewing a final determination, the city shall apply the criteria set forth above, and shall uphold the administrative decision of the public works director, unless evidence clearly demonstrates that the criteria have been satisfied.

2. After reviewing the public hearing testimony and the determination of the public works director, the city council (or hearing examiner) may approve, modify or reject the benefit reimbursement area and/or charges. This determination shall be final.

3. Any judicial appeal of the city council’s (or hearing examiner’s) determination must be filed and served within 21 days of the issuance of the decision. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.070 Written agreement – Payment of city costs in excess of application fee.

A. Upon approval of the application, formulation of a reimbursement area and charge, notice to the property owners and expiration of the appeal periods or a determination by the city council, the utility latecomer agreement, together with supporting documents, shall be presented to the city manager to sign the utility latecomer agreement on behalf of the city.

B. In the event costs incurred by the city for engineering or other professional consultant services required in processing the application exceed the amount of the application fee, the public works director shall so advise the city manager and city manager approval may be conditioned upon receipt of payment by the applicant of an additional amount sufficient to compensate the city for its actual costs in excess of the application fee. (Ord. 2816 § 1, 2002; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.080 Utility latecomer agreement must be recorded.

In order to become effective, a utility latecomer agreement must be recorded with the Jefferson County auditor. After the agreement has been signed by all parties, the city shall record the agreement, with a notice to title legally describing all properties within the benefit area, which shall constitute the notice required by RCW 65.08.170. (Ord. 2609 § 2, 1997; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.090 Construction and acceptance of improvements – Recording of final fees.

A. After the utility latecomer agreement has been signed by all parties, and all necessary permits and approvals have been obtained, the applicant shall construct the improvements and, upon completion, request final inspection and acceptance of the improvements by the city, subject to any required obligation to repair defects. The developer may begin construction during the processing of the latecomer agreement, but such construction shall be at the developer’s sole risk and the city assumes no liability in the event that the latecomer agreement does not become effective. All construction, inspection and testing shall conform to other sections of this code and to the engineering design standards manual.

B. An appropriate bill of sale, easement and any other document needed to convey the improvements to the city and to ensure right‑of‑access for maintenance and replacement shall be provided, along with documentation of the actual costs of the improvements and a certification by the applicant that all of such costs have been paid.

C. The final cost of the improvements shall be reviewed against the preliminary assessments established by the city. Upon a showing of good cause, the agreement shall be modified to include cost overruns up to a maximum of 10 percent. In the event that actual costs are less than the public works director’s estimate by 10 percent or more, the public works director shall recalculate the charges, reducing them accordingly. For any revisions under this section, the public works director shall cause a revised list of charges to be recorded with the Jefferson County auditor, with a notice to title on each property within the benefited area. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.100 Ownership of improvements or systems – As-builts.

A. Upon approval of a utility latecomer agreement and the completion and acceptance of the construction, the improvement(s) and/or system(s) shall become the property of the city. The city may charge and receive fees for utility system use according to the city’s established rates. In the alternative, upon acceptance of construction, the city may require a private maintenance agreement.

B. A copy of the engineering “as-built” plans, specifications and drawings, including all necessary rights‑of‑way and easement documents shall be provided to the city prior to acceptance of the water, sewer, or storm drainage facilities. As-built submittals shall comply with the requirements of the engineering design standards manual.

C. No connection to, or other use of, the facilities will be allowed or permitted until the city has officially accepted the construction.

D. Transfer of ownership to the city shall be clear of all encumbrances. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.110 Defective work.

The applicant shall be responsible for all work found to be defective within one year after the date of acceptance of the improvements by the city. Chapter 13.01 PTMC contains provisions for the public works director to require a performance bond for the improvements. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.120 Implementation of utility latecomer agreement – Prepayment requirement.

A. Upon recording, the utility latecomer agreement and charge shall be binding upon all property owners of record within the benefit area who were not parties to the contract. If an owner later develops his or her property within 15 years and is not required to install similar utility improvements because such improvements were already installed under the latecomer agreement, the city shall require that owner to reimburse the developer/owner who initially constructed the projects pursuant to the reimbursement share previously determined in the utility latecomer agreement.

B. Connection to or use of the system(s) by property owners within the benefit area shall be prohibited and development permission shall not be granted unless the city has received payment of the utility latecomer charge, including administrative costs. Unless modified in the agreement, the city shall add 10 percent, but not less than $20.00, to each utility latecomer charge, to be used by the city to defray the costs of labor, bookkeeping, and accounting necessary to administer the agreement, to be adjusted annually in accordance with ENR Index. No building permit shall be issued until reimbursement payment is made.

C. The utility latecomer charge shall be in addition to the usual and ordinary charges, including hook‑up fees, system development charges, and any other fees which must be paid by persons applying for city water or sewer service, as required by city ordinances.

D. The city will exercise its best efforts to assure compliance with this section; however, in no event shall the city incur liability for an unauthorized connection to or use of the facilities.

E. Where any tap or connection is made into any water, sewer or storm drainage system(s) without payment being made as required by this chapter, the city may order the unauthorized tap or connection and all connecting pipe located in the city right‑of‑way removed without any liability to the city or city officials. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.130 Payments of utility latecomer charge.

A. The city shall pay the amounts due the beneficiary within 60 calendar days of receipt, subject to subsection C of this section, by certified mail, return receipt requested.

B. When the utility latecomer fee for a particular parcel has been paid, at the request of the owner/payor, the city shall approve a certification of payment which may be recorded by the owner.

C. Throughout the term of the agreement the developer shall notify the city in writing of any change of his or her name(s) or address(es). Absent such notice, the city is not responsible for locating any developer entitled to benefits under the utility latecomer agreement. The developer may not assign any rights under the utility latecomer agreement without written notification to the city. Absent such notification, any assignment of rights under the agreement shall have no effect on the obligations of the city under the latecomer agreement.

D. Any funds not claimed by the developer within 180 days from the date collected shall become the property of the city. Before the expiration of the 180 days, the city shall send to the developer, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a final notice of the city’s intent to deposit the funds as city revenue. If the city does not receive a response by the expiration of the 180 days, the funds shall be revenue to the city sewer, water or stormwater utility or as allowed by law. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.140 Rights and nonliability of city.

A. The city reserves the right to refuse to enter into any utility latecomer agreement or to reject any application thereof.

B. All applicants for utility latecomer agreements shall be required to provide a written release, indemnification, and hold harmless agreement releasing and indemnifying the city from all claims of any nature, including property damage and personal injury arising out of the execution, establishment, enforcement and implementation of such agreement including claims arising during the course of construction and during the one‑year warranty period following acceptance of the improvements by the city. Such indemnification shall include attorney fees and costs reasonably incurred in the defense of such action. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.150 Director’s authority – Violations.

A. Director’s Authority. Whenever the public works director or his or her designee (“director”) determines that a condition exists in violation of this chapter or any standard required to be adhered to by this chapter, or in violation of any permit issued hereunder, he or she is authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 

B. Chapter 1.20 PTMC Applicable. All violations of any provision of this chapter or incorporated standards, or of any permit or license issued hereunder, are declared nuisances and made subject to the administration and enforcement provisions of Chapter 1.20 PTMC, including any amendments, and including but not limited to abatement, criminal penalty, and civil penalty as set forth in Chapter 1.20 PTMC, which are incorporated by reference as if set forth herein. (Ord. 2952 § 3, 2008; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.160 Existing latecomer agreements – Completed construction.

A. Existing Agreements. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as changing or modifying any existing utility latecomer agreement between the city and a developer, which shall remain in full force and effect and subject to its terms.

B. Through October 1, 1997, property owners may apply to the city for latecomer agreements for water, sewer or storm drainage improvements already constructed. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the reimbursement charge for such agreements shall be based on the actual cost of the constructed improvement. All other provisions of this chapter shall apply to such agreements. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2515 § 1, 1996).


13.04.170 Alternative financing method.

As an alternative to financing projects under this chapter solely by owners of real estate, the city may join in the financing of these improvement projects and may be reimbursed in the same manner as the owners of real estate who participate in the projects; provided, that the city has specified the conditions of its participation in an ordinance. The city may be reimbursed only for the costs of the improvements that benefit the portion of the public who will use the developments within the established assessment reimbursement area. No city costs for improvements that benefit the general public shall be reimbursed. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).

13.05.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to identify fees for water, sewer, and stormwater service, provide effective methods and remedies for dealing with cases of nonpayment or late payment of utility bills and to update the city’s billing procedures, to thereby protect the financial resources of the city and the rate-paying public. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.015 Definitions.

For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the meaning as defined in this section, unless the context in which the term is used clearly establishes a different meaning.

A. “Base rate” or “operational and maintenance (O&M) rate” or “monthly fixed rate” means a monthly fixed fee billed to each utility account regardless of whether a volume charge is currently billed.

B. “Service” means that the property is physically connected to either the city’s water or sewer systems or that the property is eligible to be charged a stormwater fee and for which a utility account is established with the city. For purposes of this chapter, “service” may only be terminated by permanently physically removing the water meter or permanently physically capping the side sewer connection to the main sewer. A temporary shut-off of water or sewer does not constitute termination of service.

C. “Surcharge” means a fee billed to each utility account other than the base rate or volume charge, the use of which is specifically established by the city council. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016).


13.05.020 Property owner liable for accounts.

Except as provided in PTMC 13.05.110, in all cases of utility service to residential or commercial rental property, the property owner shall be liable for the payment of the utility account, and the property owner shall be listed as the customer to whom service is provided, except that accounts may be billed to the tenant if the landlord so requests in writing. In such cases, the landlord remains responsible in the event of nonpayment by the tenant and any unpaid fees remain a lien on the premises. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.030 Monthly water fees.

The following monthly rates shall be charged by the city and collected by the finance director for the use and furnishing of water service, all such rates and charges to be made and paid on a monthly basis. These rates will be for water usage starting on January 1, 2019, and billed in subsequent months:

A. Base Rate. All properties physically connected to the city’s water system, except those metered for closed connection for fire protection, shall pay a base rate. The base rate is determined by meter size according to the schedule adopted by this section.

A manifold meter installed for irrigation purposes only shall not be subject to a separate base rate in addition to that charged for the main service meter. Stand-alone irrigation meters shall be subject to the base rate.

B. Where a meter for a residential customer that is larger than five-eighths inch to three-quarters inch has been installed for the convenience of the city, the customer shall be assessed a base rate only for the size of the meter that would have been installed if the city had not requested a larger meter. The city’s public works department shall provide the finance department the information as to what size meter would have been installed if the city had not requested a larger meter.

C. Volume Charge.

1. All properties physically connected to the city’s water system that are actually receiving water shall pay a volume charge according to the schedule adopted by this section. If water has been temporarily shut off, the property shall not be billed a volume charge.

2. Meter reading shall be done on a monthly basis. Should there be a period during which meter readings cannot be obtained under a normal reading schedule, the volume charge shall be calculated by averaging the prior consumption for the two months immediately preceding the period for which a meter reading cannot be obtained. Charges for the next month during which actual meter readings are taken shall be adjusted for the difference between the average and the actual metered volume for the two-month period involved together with the appropriate meter rate. Where there is a circumstance which, in the reasonable judgment of the finance director, would make the volume charge calculation erroneous, the volume charge shall be established under such other method as the finance director deems reasonable and fair.

D. Capital Surcharge. All properties physically connected to the city’s water system shall pay a monthly capital surcharge according to the schedule adopted by this section.

E. Repealed by Ord. 3145.

F. Repealed by Ord. 2953.

13.05.040 Monthly sewer rates.

Effective January 1, 2019, the following monthly rates shall be charged by the city and collected by the finance director for the use and furnishing of sewerage service, all such rates and charges to be made and paid on a monthly basis:

A. Base Rate. All properties physically connected to the city’s sewer system shall pay a base rate. The base rate is determined either by water usage or meter size according to the schedule adopted by this section.

B. Volume Charge. All properties physically connected to the city’s sewer system that are actually receiving water shall pay a volume charge according to the schedule adopted by this section. If water or sewer has been temporarily shut off, the property shall not be billed a volume charge.

C. Capital Surcharge. All properties physically connected to the city’s sewer system shall pay a monthly capital surcharge according to the schedule adopted by this section.

D. Industrial and Contract Customers. The city may establish fees for industrial and large usage customers that have unique or special use characteristics. The fees shall be based on existing contract conditions, costs of service including waste volume and strength, and such other factors deemed relevant in establishing reasonable fees in the judgment of the director of public works.

E. For all classes of sewer users subject to metered rates, should there be a period during which meter readings cannot be obtained under a normal reading schedule, the volume charge shall be calculated by averaging the prior consumption for the two months immediately preceding the period for which a meter reading cannot be obtained. Charges for the next month during which the actual meter reading is taken shall be adjusted for the difference between the average and the actual metered volume for the two-month period involved, together with the appropriate meter rate. Where there is a circumstance which, in the reasonable judgment of the finance director, would make the volume charge calculation erroneous, the volume charge shall be established under such other method as the finance director deems reasonable and fair.

Repealed by Ord. 2953. (Ord. 2852 § 3, 2004).


13.05.050 Monthly stormwater rates.

A. Single-Family Residential Fees. The monthly service fee for each single-family dwelling shall be per the chart below; provided, that the impervious surface on the lot shall not exceed 3,000 square feet. If the impervious surface exceeds 3,000 square feet, the rate established in subsection B of this section shall apply.

	Rate Effective January 2020	Rate Effective January 2021	Rate Effective January 2022	Rate Effective January 2023

	$7.98	$8.33	$8.63	$8.93

B. Commercial/Multifamily and All Other Fees. The monthly fee for all other property within the city not covered by subsection A of this section shall be according to the following formula:

(Impervious area/3,000 sq. ft.) x single-family rate = monthly fee.

C. State Highway Charge. Pursuant to RCW 90.03.525, the city may charge a monthly fee for state highway right-of-way.

D. Capital Surcharge. There is imposed a $6.00 monthly surcharge per stormwater utility account. (Ord. 3236 § 1, 2019; Ord. 3222 § 1, 2019; Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 3142 § 4, 2015; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2934 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2622 § 3, 1997; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2274 § 1, 1991; Ord. 2071 § 2, 1987; Ord. 2065 § 1, 1987; Ord. 2054 §§ 2, 4, 1986).


13.05.055 Boat Haven – Exemption from stormwater fees.

Because the port at Boat Haven has its own stormwater system that is independent of the city’s system, and the city’s system does not handle stormwater which originates on the port property from the port or its tenants, and because the port is required to maintain its separate Boat Haven stormwater system consistent with legal requirements, the port’s Boat Haven property and its tenants at Boat Haven are exempt from the city’s stormwater utility fees. “Boat Haven” means property that is zoned M-II(A) (Boat Haven) marine-related uses. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 3082 § 1, 2012).


13.05.060 Stormwater reserve capacity charges.

13.05.070 Commercial and industrial accounts – Deposits.

A. At the time a commercial or industrial account is requested and before it is authorized, the city finance director may require the person requesting services to make a deposit with the city.

B. Such deposit will normally be based on one month’s estimated utility charges for the business type for which services are requested.

C. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city requiring additional or new deposits when conditions such as chronic delinquencies warrant. This additional deposit will cause the total deposit to equal twice the customer’s highest bill.

D. A deposit, once established, may be refunded in whole or in part to the person or credited to the account of that person upon receipt by the city of the person’s prior utility credit rating deemed suitable by the city finance director or designee to assure with certainty that the account with the city will not become delinquent. In the absence of such assurance, the deposit may be retained by the city until a customer discontinues service. The city will apply such deposit to fully pay any remaining charges on the account. Under no circumstances shall any part of the deposit be used as payment for charges until an account has been finalized and all services have been discontinued. If circumstances such as timely payment history warrant, the city finance director may, by determining that the city is assured with certainty that an account will not become delinquent, release all or part of the deposit to the depositor upon request prior to discontinuance of service; provided, however, that no such refund will occur without the customer having a good payment history with the city for at least 12 months from the time of deposit. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.080 Bills – Preparation, delivery.

A. The city finance director shall establish and maintain a monthly system of billing for utilities provided or billed by the city. The billing shall be a consolidated billing for all utilities.

B. Once prepared, this bill shall be delivered to the customer, by deposit in the regular United States mail or by electronic means as established by the finance director, addressed to the address shown on the application for utility service submitted by the customer to the city or on any change of address submitted by the consumer to the city.

C. Deposit in the United States mail pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be deemed full and complete notice to the consumer of the nature and amount of any particular utility billing.

D. All utility bills are due and payable without further notice, when properly deposited by the city in the United States mail.

E. When service is temporarily shut off, or terminated by removal of the water meter or capping of the side sewer, the customer is responsible for payment of all outstanding utility bills.

F. The city finance director is authorized to promulgate rules and policies for the implementation of this chapter. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.090 Utility bills – When delinquent – Late payment charge established. 

A. Utility bills for which payment is not filed and received by the twentieth of the month shall be considered delinquent. Payment by the customer occurs when the payment is filed and received. Payment is deemed filed and received by the city on the date shown by the post office cancellation mark stamped on the envelope. Delinquent accounts will be assessed a minimum penalty of $5.00 or one and one-half percent of the outstanding balance per month.

B. In all cases the city finance director has the discretion to consider a deferred payment plan in accordance with PTMC 13.05.130. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.100 Utility charges are a lien against property – Water shut-off – Notice and appeal provisions.

A. Lien and Collection Rights. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all utility rates shall be charged against the premises for which the service is installed. All utility charges which become delinquent and unpaid shall be a lien against the premises for which the service is installed. This lien may be enforced by all means available at law or in equity. In addition, the city can collect the money owed by using all legal means available for the collection of a debt, including but not limited to use of a collection agency, or by filing a collection action in small claims court or superior court.

B. Water Shut-Off Notice. Pursuant to state law (RCW 35.21.290 through 35.21.300) the city may temporarily shut off water to a customer who is delinquent in paying his or her water bill. Temporarily shutting off the water does not constitute termination of water service. Prior to temporarily shutting off the water, the city shall send the customer a water shut-off notice, stating that if all delinquencies are not paid by the date identified in the notice, the city will temporarily shut off water without further notice on or after a date certain to be stated in the notice. The water shut-off notice shall state that all base rates still apply during the period the water is temporarily shut off. The water shut-off notice shall further state that if the customer has questions or concerns concerning the utility bill, he or she may request an informal hearing before the city finance director, at the address and telephone number stated in the notice, and shall inform the customer of any appeal rights of the decision of the city finance director. Any request for an informal hearing before the city finance director must be made at least seven days prior to the date of the shut-off notice.

1. The city finance director shall have the authority to review the facts, to correct any errors in the billing, and to arrange for payment terms pursuant to this chapter.

2. The city finance director’s decision may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 1.14 PTMC; provided, however, that no appeal filing fee shall be charged.

3. Restoration of Water to the Premises. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, water shall not be restored until all arrears, delinquent and unpaid charges, late payment fees, the water turn-on fee, and any required deposits are paid; provided, however, that pursuant to RCW 35.21.290 and 35.21.300, water must be restored to the premises if the last four months of water bills are paid. All other remedies available at law or in equity may be used to collect the remainder of the delinquent charges.

C. Delinquent Sewer and Stormwater Charges. The city shall have and may exercise all of those powers for collection of delinquent sewer and stormwater charges as set forth in the sewer lien foreclosure statutes, RCW 35.67.200 through 35.67.280. As an additional and concurrent method of enforcing such liens, the city may also shut off water to the premises to which such sewer and stormwater service was furnished in order to enforce payment of a delinquent sewer and stormwater bill, as provided for by RCW 35.67.290.

D. City Finance Director Authority. The city finance director is authorized to promulgate further rules and policies for the implementation of this section. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.110 Discontinuation of utility services to rented dwellings – Tenant’s rights and obligations.

A. Notice that utility services, whether voluntary (requested by property owner) or involuntary (for nonpayment of utility charges), may be temporarily discontinued shall be provided to both the owner and occupant of the premises, if the owner does not reside there. Notice to the occupant may be provided by mailing the notice to the occupant of the premises by regular mail, or posting the notice on the property. Temporary discontinuation of utility services to rented dwellings does not constitute termination of utility services, and base rates and sucharges shall continue to apply.

B. When a rented dwelling for which a delinquent utility bill is owed is occupied by a tenant, but the utility account is in the landlord’s name and the account is not billed to the tenant for payment, water will not be discontinued unless the tenant is first provided an opportunity to place the account in his or her own name without incurring any liability for the landlord’s delinquent bill. If service is discontinued before the tenant has exercised this right, the tenant can have water restored without liability for the delinquent bill by applying to place the account in his or her name for future service, and by paying the published reconnection charges.

C. A new tenant shall not be refused water service because of a prior tenant’s failure to pay a utility bill.

D. A tenant’s unpaid balance from an existing account may be transferred to a new account if the tenant moves to an address within the city’s utility service area; provided, however, that the transferred balance remains a lien against the premises where the liability was incurred and not on the new premises. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.120 Satisfaction of unrecorded utility liens upon the sale of real property.

Effective January 1, 1997, upon the sale of property with unpaid charges, the city’s lien rights shall be as specified in Chapter 60.80 RCW. That law generally provides that closing agents must request a final billing from all defined utilities, which includes the city utilities. The city is required to provide the closing agent with an estimated or actual final billing within a specified time frame. If the city fails to provide the requested information in a timely manner, any unrecorded lien for charges incurred prior to the closing date is extinguished and the city may not recover the unpaid charges from the purchaser of the property. The city retains the right to recover unpaid charges from the seller as more fully set forth in Chapter 60.80 RCW. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.130 Deferred payment.

If the customer is unable to pay the full amount of utility charges due because of temporary financial difficulties or other hardship, the city finance director may accept a deferred payment agreement. The city is not required to enter into any deferred payment agreement with any consumer who has not fully and satisfactorily complied with terms of any previous agreement. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.140 Partial payment to be prorated.

Any partial payment shall be prorated to the various utilities in the following order: water, sewer, and stormwater. Late fees shall be credited after partial payments have been assigned. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2062 § 11, 1987; Ord. 1110 § 26, 1939).


13.05.150 Contracts for use in special cases.

The city may enter into special contracts for the use of water, sewer, or stormwater service in extraordinary cases when the same do not conflict with the terms of this chapter. Further, nothing in this chapter shall affect a pre-existing rate agreement between a customer and the city for the term of such agreement(s). (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1110 § 28, 1939).


13.05.160 Payment of base rate – Abandonment of service and removal of meter.

A. All premises, whether occupied or vacant, shall be charged a base rate, consistent with the adopted fee schedule, for reservation of system capacity. A customer may request that water and sewer to the property be totally abandoned, in which case the city will permanently remove the meter. The owner will no longer be considered a current customer, and upon application to restore water and sewer in the future will be required to pay all current applicable fees and charges, including but not limited to SDCs, connection, and drop-in fees.

B. Utility customers who are participating in the low-income fee program established in Chapter 13.02 PTMC, and whose water has been temporarily shut off, shall not be charged a base rate on water or sewer, or be charged a water or sewer surcharge, or be charged a late fee, for up to one month during a given temporary shut-off period. A customer is eligible for the provisions of this subsection twice in any one calendar year. Customer shall pay stormwater fees and surcharges, and shall pay reconnection charges. (Ord. 3147 § 1, 2016; Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.170 Customer leak repair and bill adjustment.

When excessive meter registration is caused by broken or leaking water service pipes from the water meter into the structure or water pipes under the structure, including any crawl space or other structural components of the structure, without the knowledge of the customer, an adjustment to the water and wastewater bills may be made upon written application and satisfactory proof showing where the leak or break occurred and that a repair has been made. The adjustment would be for up to two months’ billing cycles. The basis for adjustment shall be the normal consumption under similar operating conditions. The billing adjustment shall not exceed $500.00. The average winter water use calculation for sewer rates shall be established in accordance with PTMC 13.05.040. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016; Ord. 2953 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.05.180 Overpayments and refunds.

A. Any customer may apply for a refund of utility fees (base rate, volume charge, or surcharge) erroneously overpaid. No refund or credit shall be made for fees paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made.

B. If the utility customer has been underbilled, the finance director shall assess the amount of fees underbilled. The city shall not assess any underbilled fees that would have accrued more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the underbilling was discovered. The finance director shall waive any late fees, interest, or penalties for underbilling if the director determines that the underbilling resulted from the city’s error. (Ord. 3145 § 3 (Exh. B), 2016).

Chapter 13.12 WATER SERVICE AND RESERVATION SYSTEM OUTSIDE OF CITY

Sections:

13.12.010    Purpose.

13.12.020    Application for water reservation and engineering design standards manual.

13.12.030    Reservations within adopted service area only.

13.12.040    Reservation requires water availability.

13.12.050    Conditions of approval regarding reservations.

13.12.060    Payment of certain fees required for issuance of water reservation – Creation of waiting list and refunds.

13.12.070    Life of water reservation – Extension.

13.12.090    Administrative decisions – Appeals.

13.12.100    Limitation on actions.


13.12.010 Purpose.

A. This chapter is intended to provide an orderly system for commitments to provide water supply to property owners located within the water utility’s outside‑of‑city service area. It is the intention of this chapter that a system of water reservation be established which will provide certainty regarding water service to those who are ready to use it at or near the time they obtain a reservation or commitment for service from the water utility while at the same time preserving the ability of the water utility to provide reliable service to its existing customers. This system is necessary to allow those who have partially developed properties adjacent to existing water infrastructure to have an opportunity in future years to obtain water supply and to avoid system capacity being reserved for large vacant parcels at a pace greatly exceeding actual rates of growth and development in the outside-of-city service area.

B. This chapter is further intended to provide a system for commitments to provide water supply to be perfected by actually paying all charges under this chapter. Payment of these charges is intended to allow the city to have the funds in hand necessary to complete major improvements to the water system, such as providing increased storage capacity, upgrading the sizes of existing main lines and other system‑wide improvements necessary to accommodate growth concurrently with the actual need for service and to create a disincentive to speculative reservations of water in advance of actual development of the property and need for the water service. Due to the limited supply of city water and the fact that water supply would soon be overcommitted if speculative reservations of water are allowed to occur and continue in significant numbers, the process established in this chapter also provides for relinquishing of the temporary commitment to provide supply if the water is not actually beneficially used within a reasonable period of time. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2393 § 1, 1994; Ord. 2387 § 1, 1993).


13.12.020 Application for water reservation and engineering design standards manual.

A. An application for water reservation shall be provided on forms established by the director of public works. The director of public works shall require a fee to be charged in the amount established by council resolution to allow processing of such applications. Applications shall, at a minimum, require the following: 

1. A legal description and address of the property to be served be provided, that the proposed use of the property be identified;

2. The proposed timing of development be identified; and

3. A property map identifying the property to be served be provided at a scale and dimension specified by the director of public works. 

An application for a water reservation shall not be accepted unless it can be established that an application for a preliminary plat, final plat, a discretionary land use permit or a building permit has been filed and is being pursued concurrently with the application for water reservation. No new taps for irrigation purposes only shall be granted in the outside-of-city service area after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. The director of public works may require that a fully engineered plan to provide service be prepared by a civil engineer licensed in the state of Washington as part of the application when, in the director’s judgment, such a plan is necessary to determine the amount of water which is to be temporarily reserved and/or it is necessary to allow the proposed water system to be integrated into the existing city water supply system. The director of public works may establish such other requirements for applications and system design as are reasonably necessary to determine the amount of water to be reserved or to insure proper design of the system. Such requirements may include the design and implementation of reasonable water conservation measures.

B. The application requirements and system design requirements for water system improvements are contained in the engineering design standards manual adopted in Chapter 13.01 PTMC as well as other applicable sections of this code. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.12.030 Reservations within adopted service area only.

A. The director of public works may only allow reservations of water service within the service area established by the city through the coordinated water system plan (CWSP) designation process. The city council may, however, on an emergency basis, either reduce the service area specified in the CWSP or halt the reservation of future water supply where failure to do so would result in overcommitment of the available supply in advance of capital facility construction necessary to provide the supply, or where the system will be unable to provide a reliable supply of water to existing customers or those who have already made temporary reservations of water supply. The emergency modification of the service area or the halting of reservation of water supply shall be established by resolution of the city council consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

B. An exception to the above requirement may be granted by the director of public works where there has been a prior, legally binding commitment made to provide service by the city. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2387 § 1, 1993).


13.12.040 Reservation requires water availability.

A. Water reservation may only be granted where there will be sufficient water supply actually available and concurrently available for the commitment being given. Water supply shall be considered sufficient only when the amount of water actually available is sufficient to reliably meet the needs of existing customers of the city, the amounts identified in wholesale contracts committed to by the city and any other valid contracts or commitments of the city regarding water supply which are in existence at the time the reservation is applied for. A request for water reservation shall be denied if there is not sufficient water supply available or if there is no specific, funded capital improvement identified in a capital facilities or capital improvement plan which would make sufficient water supply available concurrently with the development proposed in the reservation request. Concurrency shall be defined for purposes of this chapter in the same manner as it is defined in the Washington State Growth Management Act at RCW 36.70A.070 and any city of Port Townsend ordinances regarding growth management which further refine the definition of concurrency in the Growth Management Act.

B. Where requests for reservation of water are being denied because water is no longer available, a list shall be kept by the director of public works which identifies owners requesting water reservations or water connections in the order in which such requests are received. Should additional water become available and if the applicant wishes to have the application be reconsidered, applications shall be considered in the order received on a prioritization list kept by the director (per PTMC 13.12.060).

C. Should a reservation be denied by the city, the property owner is then free to approach the satellite system management agency established under the coordinated water system plan to seek alternate water service. If water service is provided by an alternate purveyor, the applicant shall be removed from the city’s prioritization list. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2387 § 1, 1993).


13.12.050 Conditions of approval regarding reservations.

The director of public works shall have the authority to impose conditions of approval regarding the issuance of a water reservation under this chapter. Such conditions of approval may include conditions regarding phasing or timing of development to insure that capital improvements necessary to provide reliable water supply concurrently with the proposed development are completed; that the reservation be tied to a specific project as proposed; that the amount of water reserved be limited; that the water reserved be specifically limited to a certain number of equivalent residential units as that term is defined in Chapter 13.03 PTMC; that certain on‑site or off‑site improvements be made by the applicant or property owner to allow system connections to be properly made; that reasonable and appropriate water conservation measures be implemented in the development of property to prevent the waste of water; and that any other reasonably necessary measures be taken to insure that the development is consistent with sound water use and development policies and practices. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2387 § 1, 1993).


13.12.060 Payment of certain fees required for issuance of water reservation – Creation of waiting list and refunds.

A. No water reservation shall be issued or be deemed valid until the following fees, set forth more fully by council resolution, are paid:

1. Water reservation application fee;

2. System development charges (SDC) for each equivalent residential unit being proposed.

B. Water tap fees shall not be payable until application for the tap is actually made and such charges are due and payable under Chapter 13.05 PTMC and council resolution. After the tap is installed, all monthly charges and user fees shall be payable whether the tap is in use or not. System development charges in the city’s outside‑of‑city service area shall be paid at the time a water reservation is approved and issued. The water reservation shall not be deemed valid until the system development charges have actually been received. System development charges shall be paid within 15 working days after notification that the reservation has been approved or the application for water reservation shall be deemed abandoned.

C. A proportional refund of charges other than the water reservation fee shall be made where the number of services or equivalent residential units (ERU) is reduced after payment of an initial fee based on a higher ERU. If the ERUs are increased, a higher fee shall be assessed for the additional ERUs before water service may be established or a reservation for the additional ERUs may be granted.

D. Where a request for water reservation has been denied because water is currently unavailable, the director of public works may, where future capital improvements will make additional water available at a later date, establish a waiting list for availability of water. The waiting list shall allow future available water to be allocated or reserved in the order in which applicants have submitted their application for water reservations or a place on the waiting list. An applicant wishing to be placed on the waiting list shall pay, prior to placement on the waiting list, in addition to the application fee for a water reservation, all system development charges for the equivalent residential units being proposed by the applicant. The system development charges paid are to be utilized for the development of additional capital facilities necessary to provide the additional water supply necessary to serve the party on the waiting list. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2393 § 2, 1994; Ord. 2387 § 1, 1993).


13.12.070 Life of water reservation – Extension.

A water reservation shall be perfected when actual installation of the tap or taps involved is complete. A water reservation for applications involving development proposals other than subdivisions shall be valid for a period of one year and shall expire unless installation of the tap occurs within that period or an extension of the reservation is granted. Upon payment of a fee established by council resolution, a water reservation for an application involving a development proposal other than a subdivision may be extended for a single additional one-year period where it is established that permit applications for development of the property have not been issued due to no fault of the applicant for reasons such as preparation of an environmental impact statement, additional public processing or requests for further analysis or information from the permitting agency. Where the water reservation application involves a subdivision, consistent with the provisions of RCW 58.17.170, the reservation shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of approval of the final plat unless a change in conditions creates a serious threat to the public health or safety. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2393 § 3, 1994; Ord. 2387 § 1, 1993).


13.12.080 Relinquishment of water reservation.

The holder of a water reservation may relinquish the right to receive the water reserved prior to installation of the actual taps. If the water reservation is relinquished prior to installation of the taps, refund of system development charges shall be made based upon the following schedule:

	Relinquishment Date	Refund Percentage

	Within one year 	90% of SDC

	Within two years 	70% of SDC

(Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2387 § 1, 1993).

All design and construction plans and specifications shall be prepared in accordance with the city’s engineering design standards manual. If base maps prepared by a licensed land surveyor are available, the design and construction plans shall be submitted on such maps. If base maps are unavailable, and the public works director determines that a survey is necessary to avoid conflicts with existing infrastructure, to determine contours, and/or to determine the limits of the right-of-way for utility placement, the applicant shall have the right-of-way surveyed, including elevations along the proposed utility route, by a licensed land surveyor and the plans shall be prepared and submitted on such surveyed base maps.

B. All plans required under this section must be prepared, signed and stamped by a Washington State licensed civil engineer. All plans shall be prepared at the developer’s sole cost and expense. 

C. All plans under this subsection must be reviewed and approved by the director prior to proceeding with construction of the proposed improvements. (Ord. 3051 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.040 Pipe size and location.

A. Size. Every new sewer main placed into service shall be eight inches in diameter, unless a larger size is indicated by hydraulic needs or the wastewater system plan or city engineering design standards manual. Hydraulic calculations shall take into account demands placed on the city’s system, size and slope of pipe.

B. Location. Sewer mains shall be installed along the complete frontage of the premises and shall be extended to the next street intersection beyond the property; provided, however, that this requirement may be waived pursuant to Chapter 13.01 PTMC. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.050 Pump stations and force mains.

All side sewers shall flow by gravity into the city’s system whenever possible. Individual side sewer pumps or public service pump stations will only be considered if no area gravity system can be constructed. Pump stations which will be turned over to the city must be sized to serve the entire region or basin which it serves. Gravity lines will be brought as far as possible (i.e., force mains shall be no longer than absolutely necessary). When allowed, pump stations and force mains shall comply with the requirements contained in the engineering design standards manual. Alternatively, private systems which are neither accepted nor maintained by the city may be installed to other standards; in such case, a private maintenance agreement shall be required in a form approved by the city attorney. The city can require pump stations and force mains to be private (i.e., not accepted and maintained by the city). Any pump stations that will serve 20 or more residences will be required to meet all city engineering design standards and shall be owned and operated by the city. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.060 Other appurtenances.

Main extension and replacements shall include all maintenance holes, cleanouts and other appurtenances as required by the engineering design standards manual and as determined to be necessary by the director for the integrity and orderly growth and needs of the sewer system. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.070 Oversizing.

A. The director shall determine the size of interceptor mains and pump stations based on projected future wastewater demands. For the purpose of determining oversizing of mains, the standard-size main required of the development shall be eight inches, unless the hydraulic demand of the development or pipe slope necessitates a larger size, as determined by the director, in which case the customer shall bear the full cost of the oversizing. For the purpose of determining oversizing of pump stations, oversizing will be considered the difference between the minimum size necessary to serve the development (or the minimum size pump station available whichever is greater) and the size required to serve the benefit area determined by the city.

B. If oversizing of a main or pump station is required for a project in Tier 1 areas (as identified in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan – see Chapter 13.01 PTMC, Definitions), the city will pay for the cost of oversizing. Oversizing costs shall be submitted for approval prior to the beginning of construction, and a bill of sale and deed of conveyance shall be submitted prior to reimbursement. 

C. If oversizing of a main or pump station is required for a project in Tier 2, the city will reimburse the oversizing costs consistent with the city’s currently adopted six-year capital improvement program (“CIP”). Oversizing costs shall be submitted for approval prior to the beginning of construction, and a bill of sale and deed of conveyance shall be submitted prior to reimbursement. 

D. Consistent with the policy directive in the comprehensive plan, if oversizing is required for a project in Tier 3, the developer shall bear the full cost of the oversizing. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.080 Construction of improvements – Testing/certifications.

A. All main extensions, replacements, pump stations and other system improvements must be situated in public rights-of-way or utility easements.

B. Private Contractors Must Be Licensed and Bonded. Any main installations done other than by city forces shall be performed by a licensed and bonded contractor of the state of Washington.

C. All work within the limits of any public area shall be completed with due diligence. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to secure the safety of all work areas. If the developer fails to do so, and if any excavation is left open beyond a reasonable time necessary to complete the work, the public works director may cause the same to be backfilled and the public area restored at the expense of the owner.

D. Testing/Certifications. All new mains and other sewer system improvements must be tested in accordance with city engineering design standards manual. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.090 Notification of city upon completion of work. 

Any person, including but not limited to any contractor, performing work under this chapter shall also notify the public works department in writing no later than seven days after the connection is made that the connection has been made. The notice shall include the property owner’s name, the address of the premises, and the file number of the permit. The public works department shall then notify the city utility billing office for purposes of commencement of sewer service charges. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.100 Prevention of damage to public sewer.

The sewer contractor or other persons doing the work shall prevent any damage to the sewer main, tee or stub out, and also conduct his/her trenching operations as to prevent the possibility of damage to the system occurring. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.23.110 Acceptance of improvements.

The city reserves the right to reject any installation not inspected, tested and approved by the department. Upon satisfactory completion of all required tests and acceptance of the improvements, the department shall cause the improvements to be connected to the city system. All costs incurred in such connection(s) shall be the responsibility of the customer. As a condition of acceptance of the improvements by the city, the permit holder shall provide the city with (1) a statement of the actual cost of design and construction of the sewer improvements; (2) a properly executed bill of sale for all improvements; and (3) as-built drawings prepared in accordance with the engineering design standards manual. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


Chapter 13.24 CLASSIFICATION OF HIGH‑STRENGTH WASTEWATER, CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DISCHARGES, AND PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS

Sections:

13.24.010    Purpose.

13.24.020    Permission to discharge high-strength waste – Pretreatment requirements – Grease traps required.

13.24.030    Standard Industry Code classifications.

13.24.040    Commodity charge.

13.24.050    Alternate approach to determination of rates.


13.24.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to classify high-strength wastewater and establish special wastewater rates for users of the city’s sewer system which generate certain high‑strength wastes or have high variability in waste loadings and identify pretreatment requirements. It is intended that such special rates will provide a system of charges which equitably reflect the costs to the city of treating such wastes. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2343 § 1, 1993).


13.24.020 Permission to discharge high-strength waste – Pretreatment requirements – Grease traps required.

A. Any person or business proposing to discharge high-strength wastes to the city’s sewer system shall apply to the public works director for approval to discharge. The public works director may establish conditions for discharge and monitoring requirements as further established in this chapter.

B. Whenever preliminary treatment is necessary to reduce the strength of the waste to within the maximum limits prescribed by Chapter 13.21 PTMC, such preliminary treatment shall be at the sole expense of the owner of the premises and shall be installed when the director determines that the same is necessary to comply with the standards prescribed. In such cases, all plans, specifications and other pertinent information relating to such proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted to the director prior to commencement of construction and no construction thereof shall be commenced until the director’s approval is noted on the plan. In the event of such installations, they shall be maintained continuously in efficient operation by the owner at his or her own expense.

C. Grease traps will be required on all restaurants or other establishments as determined necessary by the public works director. All costs associated with design, installation and maintenance to insure a working, reliable grease trap system will be the responsibility of the owner. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997).


13.24.030 Standard Industry Code classifications.

A. The following types of business activities shall be assigned Standard Industry Code (“SIC”) classifications as indicated below:

	Business Activity	Classification

	Brewery	SIC #4

	Restaurants/taverns full‑service	SIC #3

	Fast food 	SIC #3

	Prepackaged servers 	SIC #1

	Supermarkets:

	with deli, bakery, etc. 	SIC #3

	without deli, bakery, etc. 	SIC #1

	Convenience stores 	SIC #1

	Canneries (food processors) 	SIC #4

	Convalescent homes 	SIC #3

	Marinas	SIC #3

	Washington State Ferries 	SIC #4

B. Each commercial and industrial account shall be assigned to a SIC by the director of public works based on a review of the wastewater discharges from each account. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2343 § 1, 1993).


13.24.040 Commodity charge.

A. A commodity charge shall be based on water use and wastewater strength. Charges shall be on a block rate, with the block rate increasing based on strength of the waste, as follows:

	Classification	Surcharge above commodity charge as identified in Chapter 13.05 PTMC

	SIC #1 

	< 300 mg/l BOD or TSS	$0.00/1,000 gallons

	SIC #2 

	301 – 500 mg/l BOD or TSS 	$0.00/1,000 gallons

	SIC #3 

	501 – 700 mg/l BOD or TSS 	$0.00/1,000 gallons

	SIC #4 

	>700 mg/l BOD or TSS or	$0.88/1,000 gallons

	variability in loadings *	plus $0.98/lb BOD

	 	plus $0.62/lb TSS

*Such as Washington State Ferries or other users with instantaneous discharges or other use that causes wide swings in either wastewater quantity or strength that may cause collection or interceptor sewer concerns or potential adverse impacts on the wastewater treatment plant process. The city has the option to monitor and/or test the quality of these wastes or assume that the strength is 700 mg/l for BOD and/or TSS.

B. Water use may be measured at the customer’s water meter, or by installation of a wastewater meter per PTMC 13.24.050. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2343 § 1, 1993).


13.24.050 Alternate approach to determination of rates.

When the director deems necessary, or when any sewer customer believes they have been assigned a Standard Industrial Code classification which is not appropriate, the sewer rate may be determined as follows and the customer shall pay the city a monthly fee based upon the actual use of the city wastewater treatment facility as measured by parameters which shall be determined in accordance with the following procedures:

A. Metering. The wastewater flow into the sewerage system will be metered at the point where the facility discharges wastewater into the city system. The cost of installation and maintenance of the meter shall be paid by the customer. The flow metering installation at the facility shall be calibrated quarterly and equipped with a totalizer. Daily maintenance by the facility shall include at least a check of the primary element of the flow meter for obstructions and a visual check of all other elements of the installation for normal operation. A daily log shall be kept by the facility in which all maintenance operations performed and any abnormalities observed shall be noted. The totalizer reading shall also be recorded daily in the log. At the end of each month, the average daily flow during the month shall be determined by using all the valid data collected during the month (total flow divided by days of operation).

B. BOD and Suspended Solids. The monitoring facility shall be equipped with an automatic liquid sampling device which shall be integrated with the flow‑metering installation in such a manner that wastewater samples can be collected on a flow‑weighted basis and stored. A composite sample shall be prepared weekly, as directed by the city, from all samples collected during a uniform 24‑hour period. The BOD and SS of each sample shall be determined and recorded in the log. At the end of each month, the average BOD and TSS during the month shall be determined by using all the valid data collected during the month. After a period of one year, the city may reduce the frequency of monitoring (provided there are no other constraints such as a Department of Ecology permit precluding less frequent monitoring).

C. Records. The facility shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities. Such records for all samples shall include:

1. The date, exact place, method and time of sampling;

2. The names of persons taking the sample;

3. The date the analysis was done;

4. The names of persons doing the analysis;

5. The analytical techniques used;

6. The results of the analysis.

D. Calculation of Maintenance and Operation Expenses. The data collected shall be used by the city to calculate the share of the total maintenance and operation expenses which shall be charged to the facility. The method of calculation of maintenance and operation expenses to be charged shall be as follows:

1. O&M charge to the facility during billing period = cost factor x monthly city treatment facility O&M cost.

2. Cost factor = (Vf/Vc)(0.2 + 0.4 BODf/BODc + 0.4 TSSf/TSSc).

where:

	Vf = 	average daily wastewater flow (in gallons) from the facility during billing period.

	Vc = 	average daily wastewater flow for the city of Port Townsend wastewater treatment facility plant during billing period (gallons).

	BODf = 	average daily five‑day BOD concentration of wastewater from the facility during billing period.

	BODc = 	average daily five‑day BOD concentration of total plant wastewater during billing period.

	TSSf = 	average daily TSS concentration of wastewater from the facility during billing period.

	TSSc = 	average daily TSS concentration of wastewater of total plant during billing period.

E. Lab Testing. One set of BOD, FOG (fat, oil and grease), TSS (total suspended solids), VSS (volatile suspended solids) and pH tests will be required on a composite sample collected by the sewer customer on a weekly basis, or other tests and/or testing intervals as determined by the director, while the facility discharges to the city sewer system. Fees for the required tests shall be paid by the facility. The facility shall have all testing done by a lab that is certified by the Washington State Department of Ecology to perform the required analysis.

F. Operation. The city shall have free access to the facility and the records of operation and maintenance. The records of operation and maintenance shall be kept at the facility and shall be made available to the city during the site visit by the city. The city shall have access to the facility at reasonable hours without prior notice. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2343 § 1, 1993).

In the event that public benefits would accrue due to modification of the drainage plan for the subject property to better implement the recommendations of the comprehensive drainage plan, the public works department may recommend that the city should assume responsibility for the further design, construction, operation and maintenance of drainage facilities on the subject property. Such decision shall be made concurrently with review and approval of the plan as specified in PTMC 13.32.050. In the event that the city decides to assume responsibility for design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the facilities, the developer will be required to contribute a pro rata share to the construction cost of the facilities. The developer may be required to supply additional information at the request of the public works department to aid in the determination by the city. Guidelines for implementing this section will be defined in the engineering design standards manual and/or DOE Stormwater Management Manual for the Puget Sound Basin. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1957 § 8, 1983).


13.32.070 Applicability to government entities.

A. All municipal corporations and governmental entities shall be required to submit a drainage plan and comply with the terms of this chapter when developing and/or improving land including, but not limited to, road building and widening within the areas of the city.

B. It is recognized that many other city, county, state and federal permit conditions may apply to the proposed action and that compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not constitute compliance with such other requirements. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1957 § 12, 1983).


13.32.080 Protection of public/private rights.

Implementation of any provision of this chapter shall not cause nor be construed as an infringement of the rights of individuals, municipalities, or corporations other than the developer seeking a permit or approval as described in PTMC 13.32.030. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1957 § 14, 1983).

Article I. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives


16.08.010 Statutory authorization.

The Legislature of the State of Washington has in Chapter 86.16 RCW, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 1.1, 1989). 


16.08.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of Port Townsend are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 1.2, 1989). 


16.08.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A. To protect human life and health;

B. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in the SFHA;

F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of the SFHA so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in the SFHA;

H. To ensure that those who occupy the SFHA assume responsibility for their actions;

I. To qualify the city of Port Townsend for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, thereby giving citizens and businesses the opportunity to purchase flood insurance;

J. To maintain water quality in water bodies and their floodplains so as to protect public water supplies, areas of the public trust, and wildlife habitat protected by the Endangered Species Act;

K. To retain the natural channel, shoreline, and floodplain creation processes and other natural floodplain functions that protect, create, and maintain habitat for threatened and endangered species;

L. To prevent or minimize loss of hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological functions of floodplains; and

M. To protect significant cultural and historic properties including buildings, structures, districts, sites, objects, and landscapes, and avoid or minimize adverse effects to these properties.

Except as specifically provided in this chapter, these regulations implement mandatory federal and state regulations rather than discretionary local regulations. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 1.3, 1989). 


16.08.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Controlling dredging, filling, grading, and other development which may increase flood damage;

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas; and

F. Establishing a permit requirement so that all development that may affect flood hazards, water quality, and habitat are reviewed before it is constructed. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 1.4, 1989).

Article II. Definitions


16.08.050 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

A. “Adversely affect/adverse effect” means effects that are a direct or indirect result of the proposed action, or its interrelated or interdependent actions, and the effect is not discountable, insignificant or beneficial, where:

1. a. Discountable effects are extremely unlikely to occur; and

b. Insignificant effects relate to the size of the impact and should never reach the scale where a take occurs. Based on best judgment, a person would not meaningfully measure, detect, or evaluate insignificant effects or expect discountable effects to occur.

2. Beneficial effects are contemporaneous positive effects without any adverse effects. In the event that the overall effect of the proposed action is beneficial, but is also likely to cause some adverse effects, then the proposed action is considered to result in an adverse effect.

B. “Appeal” means a request for review of the building department interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

C. “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

D. “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

E. “Base flood elevation” means the elevation of the base flood above the datum of the effective FIRM.

F. “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

G. “Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not a part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

H. “Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on the FIRM as zone V1-V30, VE or V.

I. “Critical facility” means a facility necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare during a flood. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency operations installations, water and wastewater treatment plants, electric power stations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (other than consumer products containing hazardous substances or hazardous waste intended for household use).

J. “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

K. “Elevation certificate” means the official form (FEMA Form 086-0-33) used to track development, provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with community floodplain management ordinances, and determine the proper insurance premium rate with Section B completed by community officials.

M. “FEMA” means the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the agency responsible for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.

N. “Flood” or “flooding” means:

1. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

a. The overflow of inland or tidal waters.

b. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

c. Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in subsection (1)(b) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.

2. The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in subsection (1)(a) of this definition.

O. “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the SFHA and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM).

P. “Flood insurance study” or “flood elevation study” means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards.

Q. “Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate risk of flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.

R. “Floodway” or “regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. (As of June 7, 2019, there are no floodways within the city limits.)

S. “Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

T. “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

U. “Historic structure” means, for the purposes of this chapter, any structure that is:

1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either:

a. By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or

b. Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

V. “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including the basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at PTMC 16.08.170(A)(2).

W. “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.” For floodplain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. (See also “Recreational vehicle.”)

X. “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

Y. ”Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

Z. “New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

AA. “Ordinary high water mark” (often abbreviated “OHWM”) means that mark on all lakes, streams, and tidal waters that will be found by examining the bed and banks and ascertaining where the presence and action of waters are so common and usual, and so long continued in all ordinary years, as to mark upon the soil a character distinct from that of the abutting upland in respect to vegetation as that condition exists on June 1, 1971, or as it may naturally change thereafter; or as it may change thereafter in accordance with permits issued by the local government or the Washington State Department of Ecology; provided, that in any area where the ordinary high water mark cannot be found, the ordinary high water mark adjoining salt water shall be the line of mean higher high tide, and the ordinary high water mark adjoining fresh water shall be the line of mean high water.

BB. Protected Area. Within the city of Port Townsend, “protected areas” means lands within the SFHA that also lie within:

1. Two hundred feet from marine shorelines as measured perpendicularly from ordinary high water mark.

2. Two hundred fifty feet from freshwater lakes mapped special flood hazard area as measured perpendicularly from ordinary high water mark.

CC. “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

1. Built on a single chassis;

2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4. Designed primarily as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use, not as a permanent dwelling.

DD. “Special flood hazard area” (“SFHA”) or “area of special flood hazard” is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated on flood insurance rate maps with the letter “A” or “V.” After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term “special flood hazard area” is synonymous in meaning with the phrase “area of special flood hazard.”

EE. “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

FF. “Structure” means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Structure, for insurance purposes, means: (1) a building, with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; (2) a manufactured home (a “manufactured home,” also known as a mobile home, is a structure built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or (3) a travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community’s floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. For the latter purpose, “structure” does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in subsection (3) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank.

GG. “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

HH. “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

II. “Variances” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

JJ. “Water dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations.

KK. “Zone” for the purposes of this chapter means one or more areas delineated on the FIRM. The following zones may be used on the adopted FIRM. The special flood hazard area is comprised of the A and V zones. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2854 § 5, 2004; Ord. 2161 § 2, 1989). 

Article III. General Provisions


16.08.060 Lands to which this chapter applies.

This chapter shall apply to the special flood hazard area (SFHA) within the jurisdiction of the city of Port Townsend. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 3.1, 1989).

This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Port Townsend, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 3.6, 1989).

Article IV. Administration


16.08.120 Development permit required.

A. Construction or development shall not be undertaken within any area of special flood hazard (SFHA) established in PTMC 16.08.070 without approval under this chapter.

1. For development where no other permit or authorization from the city of Port Townsend is necessary to begin or to accomplish the work, the approval shall be documented by issuance of a floodplain development permit.

An application for floodplain development permit shall be processed according to the procedures for a Type I-A permit as established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures.

2. For development where some other permit or authorization from the city of Port Townsend is required to begin or accomplish the work, including but not limited to development performed by city departments, the floodplain development approval shall be incorporated in such other permit or authorization.

B. A development project is not subject to the requirements of this chapter if it is located on land that can be shown to be outside of the special flood hazard area based on a review of the flood insurance rate maps or by FEMA approval of a letter of map change.

C. Habitat Assessment – When Required. A development permit application shall include a habitat assessment unless the project is, in its entirety, one of the following activities:

1. Routine maintenance of existing landscaping that does not involve grading, excavation, or filling.

2. Removal of noxious weeds, hazard trees, and replacement of nonnative vegetation with native vegetation.

3. Normal maintenance of above-ground utilities and facilities, such as replacing power lines and utility poles.

4. Normal road maintenance, such as filling potholes, repaving, installing signs and traffic signals, but not including any expansion.

5. Normal maintenance of a levee or other flood control facility as prescribed in the operations and maintenance plan for the facility. Normal maintenance does not include repair from flood damage, any expansion of the prism, face or toe expansion, or the addition of material for protection or armor.

6. Plowing and other normal farm practices (other than new structures or filling) on legally existing agricultural areas. Clearing additional land for agriculture will likely require a floodplain development permit and a habitat assessment.

7. Normal maintenance, repairs, or remodeling of structures, such as reroofing and replacing siding, provided such work is not a substantial improvement or a repair of substantial damage. To comply, such work must be less than 50 percent of the value of the structure(s).

8. Expansion or reconstruction of an existing structure that is no greater than 10 percent beyond its existing footprint. If the structure is in the floodway, there shall be no change in the structure’s dimensions perpendicular to flow. All other federal and state requirements and restrictions relating to floodway development still apply.

9. Activities with the sole purpose of creating, restoring, or enhancing natural functions associated with floodplains, streams, lakes, estuaries, marine areas, habitat, and riparian areas that meet federal and state standards, provided the activities do not include structures, grading, fill, or impervious surfaces.

10. Development of open space and recreational facilities, such as parks, trails, and hunting grounds, that do not include structures, fill, impervious surfaces, or removal of more than five percent of the native vegetation on that portion of the property in the floodplain.

11. Repair to on-site septic systems, provided ground disturbance is the minimal necessary and best management practices (BMPs) to prevent stormwater runoff and soil erosion are used.

12. Projects that have already received concurrence under another permit or other consultation with the services, either through Section 7, Section 4d, or Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that addresses the entirety of the project in the floodplain (such as an Army Corps 404 permit or nonconversion forest practice activities including any interrelated and interdependent activities).

13. Repair of an existing, functional bulkhead in the same location and footprint with the same materials when the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) is still outside of the face of the bulkhead (i.e., if the work qualifies for a corps exemption from Section 404 coverage). (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 4.1-1, 1989).


16.08.130 Application submittal and contents.

E. Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;

F. Unless listed under PTMC 16.08.120(C), applications for projects located within the SFHA shall include a habitat impact assessment prepared in accordance with PTMC 19.05.080(J), Special Report Required. Projects within the protected area must be inherently designed to avoid adverse impacts to floodplain functions that support ESA listed species;

G. The application shall include documentation that the applicant will apply for all necessary permits required by federal, state, or local law. The application shall include acknowledgment that the applicant understands that the final certificate of occupancy will be issued only if the applicant provides copies of the required federal, state, and local permits or letters stating that a permit is not required. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 4.1-2, 1989). 


16.08.140 Designation of the floodplain administrator.

The planning director or his/her designee is hereby designated to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 4.2, 1989). 


16.08.150 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.

Duties of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

A. Permit Review.

1. Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;

2. Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required;

3. Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that encroachment provisions are met.

B. Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with PTMC 16.08.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer PTMC 16.08.170.

C. Information to Be Obtained and Maintained.

1. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or required as in subsection (B) of this section, obtain and record the actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. (44 CFR 60.3(b)(5)(i).)

2. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required in subsection (B) of this section:

a. Obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed. (44 CFR 60.3(b)(5)(ii).)

b. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in PTMC 16.08.170(B)(2). (44 CFR 60.3(b)(5)(iii).)

3. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. (44 CFR 60.3(b)(5)(iii).)

D. Notification to Other Entities.

1. Alteration of Watercourses.

a. Notify adjacent communities and the Washington State Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.

b. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

2. Changes to Special Flood Hazard Area. Submit new technical data to Federal Insurance Administrator. A community’s base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the city’s floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with 44 CFR 65.3. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.

E. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations, where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the SFHA (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation. Such appeal shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 59 through 76).

F. Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2854 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2161 § 4.3, 1989).


16.08.155 Variances.

A. Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum necessary and may only be issued for functionally dependent uses as defined in this chapter.

B. Procedure. Variance applications shall be submitted on forms provided by the director accompanied by the applicable fee. Variances shall be processed as a Type II permit application according to the procedures in Chapter 20.01 PTMC and shall satisfy the approval criteria of this section.

C. Approval Criteria. The decisionmaker may approve or approve with modifications an application for a variance from the provisions of this chapter upon making the following affirmative findings:

1. The use is a functionally dependent use, as defined in this chapter, which requires a variance in order to perform its intended purpose. The structure or other development will be protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety;

2. Granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;

3. The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. Where feasible, methods to meet the floodplain management requirements have been incorporated (e.g., wet floodproofing techniques, installing flood damage-resistant materials, elevating mechanical equipment, locating offices above the BFE, using ground fault circuit interrupters, or developing an emergency plan to remove contents before a flood);

4. The applicant has demonstrated good and sufficient cause;

5. Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

6. If the proposal is within a floodway, no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variance Conditions. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017).

Article V. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction


16.08.160 General standards.

In all special flood hazard areas (SFHAs), the following standards are required:

A. Anchoring.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.

2. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).

B. Construction Materials and Methods.

1. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

3. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Locating such equipment below the base flood elevation may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be increased.

C. Utilities.

1. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;

2. Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway;

3. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and

4. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

D. Land Division. The following standards apply to all subdivision proposals and other development where 50 or more lots are being created or the project includes five or more acres:

1. All land divisions shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

2. All land divisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;

3. All land divisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and

4. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).

E. Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source (PTMC 16.08.150(B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 5.1, 1989).


16.08.170 Specific standards.

In all special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in PTMC 16.08.070 or 16.08.150(B), the following provisions are required:

A. Residential Construction. (For manufactured homes see subsection (E) of this section.)

1. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet or more above base flood elevation.

2. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be used only for parking, storage, or building access and shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

B. Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either be:

1. Elevated.

a. Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation; and

b. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (A)(2) of this section; or

2. Floodproofed. The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

a. Be floodproofed so that below two feet above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in PTMC 16.08.150(C)(2);

d. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to one foot above the base flood level will be rated as at the base flood level).

C. Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

D. Critical Facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the base floodplain. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the base floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the base floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base floodplain shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

E. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within SFHA on the community’s FIRM shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated two feet or more above the base flood elevation specified on the FIRM (at least two feet above the highest grade adjacent to the structure if no BFE is specified); and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of PTMC 16.08.160(A)(2). (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2854 § 3, 2004; Ord. 2161 § 5.2, 1989).

Repealed by Ord. 3224. (Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 5.6, 1989).


16.08.220 Coastal high hazard areas.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in PTMC 16.08.070 are coastal high hazard areas, designated as zones V1-V30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:

A. All new allowable construction and substantial improvements in zones V1-V30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:

1. The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated two feet or more above the base flood level; and

2. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (A)(1) and (2) of this section.

B. Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in zones V1-V30 and VE, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The local administrator shall maintain a record of all such information.

C. All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.

D. Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

E. If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.

F. Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings.

G. Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 3173 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2161 § 5.7, 1989).


16.08.230 Severability.

If any section, clause, sentence or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. (Ord. 3224 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019).

17.12.050 Boundary interpretation.

Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district shown on said map, the following rules shall apply:

A. Where a boundary follows a public street or alley, the centerline of the street shall be the boundary. Where a boundary follows a lot line, the lot line shall be the boundary.

B. Where a boundary divides a lot that is equal to or less than one acre in size (i.e., or one platted block) into two single-family residential zoning district classifications, the district classification that has been applied to greater than 50 percent of said lot shall apply to the entirety thereof.

C. Where a boundary divides a lot larger than one acre in size (i.e., or one platted block) into two single-family residential zoning district classifications, the location of the boundary, unless indicated by dimension, shall be determined by referencing the adopted comprehensive plan land use map and legal description of the parcel.

D. Where a boundary divides a lot that is equal to or less than 10,000 square feet in size into two zoning district classifications and one of the classifications is multifamily residential, mixed use, commercial, or marine-related and manufacturing, the district classification that has been applied to greater than 50 percent of said lot shall apply to the entirety thereof.

E. Where a boundary divides a lot that is greater than 10,000 square feet in size into two zoning district classifications and one of the classifications is multifamily residential, mixed use, commercial, or marine-related and manufacturing, the location of the boundary, unless indicated by dimension, shall be determined by referencing the adopted comprehensive plan land use map and legal description of the parcel.

F. Where any public right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, the land use district regulations applied to abutting property shall thereafter extend to the centerline of such vacated or abandoned right-of-way, unless the right-of-way is wholly contained within, and forms the outside boundary of, a recorded plat, in which case the land use district regulations applied to the abutting property shall thereafter extend through the entire vacated or abandoned right-of-way.

G. In case any uncertainty exists, the director shall determine the location of the district boundary, pursuant to Chapters 17.90 and 20.02 PTMC, as applicable. (Ord. 2700 § 8, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


Chapter 17.16 RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS

17.16.010 Purposes.

A. Residential Districts. The general purposes of the residential districts are as follows:

1. To provide a sustainable residential development pattern for future generations;

2. To encourage development of attractive residential areas that provide a sense of community and contain a variety of housing types to accommodate different lifestyles and household sizes;

3. To maintain or improve the character, appearance, and livability of established neighborhoods by protecting them from incompatible uses, excessive noise, illumination, glare, odor, and similar significant nuisances;

4. To establish a compact growth pattern to efficiently use the remaining developable land; enable cost effective extension and maintenance of utilities, streets, and transit; and enable development of affordable housing;

5. To enable community residents to reside and work within walking or bicycling distance of transit, employment centers, and businesses offering needed goods and services in order to reduce traffic congestion, energy consumption, and air pollution;

6. To provide for development of neighborhoods with attractive, well-connected streets, sidewalks, and trails that enable convenient, direct access to neighborhood centers, parks, and transit stops;

7. To ensure adequate light, air, and readily accessible open space for each dwelling unit in order to maintain public health, safety, and welfare;

8. To ensure the compatibility of dissimilar adjoining land uses;

9. To protect or enhance the character of historic structures and areas;

10. To provide residential areas of sufficient size and density to accommodate the city’s projected population growth, consistent with RCW 36.70A.110;

11. To preserve or enhance environmental quality and protect groundwater used as a public water source from contamination;

12. To minimize the potential for significant flooding and allow recharge of groundwater;

13. To allow innovative approaches for providing housing, consistent with the policies of the comprehensive plan.

B. The additional purposes of each individual residential district are as follows:

1. R-I – Low Density Single-Family. This district accommodates single-family residences (including duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes) at a density of up to four dwelling units per 40,000-square-foot area (i.e., 10,000-square-foot minimum lot size, or approximately four dwelling units within one block of platted land). It allows four or fewer single-family dwelling units to be contained within one structure upon condition of sufficient tract size: 20,000 square feet for a duplex; 30,000 square feet for a triplex; and 40,000 square feet for a fourplex. Limited multifamily development could occur with approval of a planned unit development. This zoning district has been applied only in the northwestern portion of the city, because of stormwater related development constraints. The district accommodates single-family development at densities that maintain and promote the “small town” character of Port Townsend, while ensuring that the environmental quality (particularly as it relates to stormwater control) of the area is not adversely impacted. Higher densities could be permitted in these areas through approval of a planned unit development (R-PUD) overlay designation pursuant to Chapter 17.32 PTMC.

2. R-II – Medium Density Single-Family. This district accommodates single-family dwellings (including duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes) at a density of up to eight units per 40,000-square-foot area (i.e., 5,000-square-foot minimum lot size, or approximately eight dwelling units within one block of platted land). It allows four or fewer single-family dwelling units to be contained within one structure upon condition of sufficient tract size: 10,000 square feet for a duplex; 15,000 square feet for a triplex; and 20,000 square feet for a fourplex. Limited multifamily development could occur with approval of a planned unit development. The R-II district corresponds closely to those areas of town that are currently platted to eight lots per block, include few development limitations, and which are in proximity to existing public facilities and services.

3. R-III – Medium Density Multifamily. The R-III district accommodates smaller scale multifamily structures (e.g., five to 12 dwellings per structure) at a minimum density of 10 units and a maximum of up to 16 units per 40,000 square feet of land area. The intent of this district is to provide a broad range of housing opportunities; to provide a variety of housing types and styles; and to provide for development with a density and configuration that facilitates effective and efficient transit service. Although multifamily development is encouraged in these areas, single-family residences continue to be an allowed use provided the minimum density requirement can be achieved. This district includes areas along arterial and major collector streets with existing or planned transit service.

4. R-IV – High Density Multifamily. This district accommodates larger scale multifamily structures (e.g., 10 to 24 dwellings per structure) at a density of not less than 15 units per 40,000 square feet of land area, or more than 24 units per 40,000 square feet of land area. A minimum density has been specified for this district in order to discourage use of this land for subordinate, lower density development; single-family dwellings are not permitted in this district. This district includes areas designed to be compatible with adjoining uses; to provide for development with a density and configuration that facilitates effective and efficient transit service; and to enable provision of affordable housing.

C. Accessory Dwelling Units. This chapter provides standards for the establishment of accessory dwelling units within the structure of a single-family residence or an outbuilding which is accessory to such residence. Accessory dwelling units are allowed in order to:

1. Allow more energy efficient use of large, older homes;

2. Provide more affordable housing opportunities for Port Townsend residents;

3. Provide additional density with minimal cost and disruption to existing neighborhoods; and

4. Allow individuals and smaller households to retain large houses as residences. (Ord. 2967 § 4.1, 2008; Ord. 2825 § 4, 2003; Ord. 2782 § 4, 2001; Ord. 2716 § 4.2, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.16.020 Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses – Accessory dwelling units.

A. Table 17.16.020 identifies land uses in the residential zoning districts that are permitted outright (P), subject to a conditional use permit (C), prohibited (X), or not applicable (N/A). However, notwithstanding the fact that a use may be permitted outright, additional permits may be required for certain projects. For example, multifamily residential development project applicants must procure a Type I permit in accordance with Chapter 17.36 PTMC, Multifamily Residential Development Standards. Uses not specifically identified within Table 17.16.020 are deemed to be contrary to the interests of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Port Townsend and shall be prohibited.

B. Requirements for the uses identified in Table 17.16.020 which are contained within other provisions of this title are referenced under the heading “applicable regulations/notes,” although this should not be construed as a comprehensive listing of all provisions of this title which may apply to any given use. Specifically, the provisions of Chapter 17.72 PTMC, Off-Street Parking and Loading, and Chapter 17.76 PTMC, Signs, shall apply to all uses, even if not noted in Table 17.16.020.

C. Accessory Dwelling Units – Limitations on Use. One accessory dwelling unit (ADU) may be established only as an accessory use to a single-family, detached residence (and specifically not including a duplex, triplex or fourplex), provided the following conditions are continuously met:

1. A certificate of occupancy pursuant to the currently adopted city construction codes shall be obtained from the building official and posted within the ADU. The code inspection and compliance required to obtain a certificate of occupancy in an existing building shall be restricted to the portion of the building to be occupied by an ADU and shall apply only to new construction rather than existing components, except that any high hazards (i.e., smoke detectors, fire exits, stairways, LP gas appliances and fire separation) shall be corrected. Where additional fire separation is unduly burdensome, the building official may authorize a fire alarm system in lieu of required fire separation.

2. Neither the main nor accessory dwelling unit shall be used as a short term rental, except as provided for in PTMC 17.57.020(B)(2).

3. ADUs established in an outbuilding shall not exceed 800 square feet in floor area and ADUs established within or attached to the primary residence shall not exceed 1,000 square feet, and under no circumstance shall the total lot coverage of the primary residence along with the ADU exceed the standard allowed in the underlying zoning district.

4. In order to preserve the outward appearance of single-family neighborhoods, the front of the house shall have only one exterior entrance.

5. An ADU may be established in a residence or outbuilding that is legal, nonconforming with respect to required setbacks if entrances are no closer than five feet to neighboring property lines, and if each side window that is closer than five feet to a side property line and that is also closer than 20 feet to either the front or rear property line is permanently glazed with translucent material; provided, that the director may permit an entrance as close as three feet to a neighboring property line upon a finding that no feasible alternative exists.

6. Repealed by Ord. 2939.

D. Accessory Dwelling Units – Exception for Legal, Nonconforming Accessory Dwelling Units. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C of this section, in the case of an ADU established prior to August 17, 1971, and continuously occupied thereafter, the ADU may continue without compliance with PTMC 17.16.020(C)(1) and (C)(2), provided a certificate of occupancy is obtained pursuant to PTMC 17.16.020(C)(1).

[Note: The fee for inspection and issuance of a certificate of occupancy for an accessory dwelling unit shall be the same as that established in the currently adopted International Building Code for a special inspection. For the purposes of determining system development charges or utility or infrastructure requirements, a single-family residence with an accessory dwelling unit which does not separately connect to city water or sewer service shall have the same charges and the same requirements as a single-family residence without an accessory dwelling unit.]

E. Incidental uses which are identified in this title as prohibited or conditional uses within the applicable zoning district shall be considered conditional and processed in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC subject to the approval criteria codified in Chapter 17.84 PTMC.

17.16.025 Medical marijuana, personal cultivation and noncommercial collective gardens – Standards and requirements.

A. Purpose and Intent.

1. The state of Washington, under Chapter 69.51A RCW, has determined that qualified patients (or their designated providers) with terminal or debilitating medical conditions, who, in the judgment of their health care professionals, may benefit from the medical use of cannabis (marijuana) shall not be arrested, prosecuted or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences under state law, based solely on their medical use of cannabis (marijuana), notwithstanding any other provision of law.

2. This subsection is intended to acknowledge state law and accommodate the needs of Port Townsend’s qualifying patients while ensuring the character, livability and safety of its residential neighborhoods are adequately protected. Through adoption of clear local standards that are in addition to the limitations established under Chapter 69.51A RCW, the needs for medical cannabis (marijuana) patients can be met on a continual basis without adverse impacts to the neighboring properties or the general public.

3. Where permitted in the city’s residential zones, all impacts generated by medical cannabis cultivation, including cultivation done in noncommercial collective gardens as defined by this title, are limited to those roughly proportional to those associated with allowed uses (by right or through approved home occupation as provided for under PTMC 17.56.070). Furthermore, membership in noncommercial collective gardens is not intended to accommodate more than 10 specific individuals over a minimum six-month preidentified time period.

B. Personal Cultivation. The cultivation of medical cannabis by an individual qualifying patient (or their designated provider) for their personal use within his/her private residence is provided for under RCW 69.51A.040. In addition to the provisions of state law, the cultivation of medical cannabis for personal use by individual qualifying patients shall adhere to the following local standards:

1. The qualified patient (or designated provider) shall reside on the property where the medical cannabis is cultivated. Cannabis processing must occur indoors within a rigid structure (e.g., a primary or accessory building);

2. From a public right-of-way, there shall be no exterior evidence of medical cannabis cultivation on the site;

3. Cultivation or processing of medical cannabis for commercial retail purposes, wholesale or sales as a home occupation is prohibited.

C. Noncommercial Collective Gardens. Establishment of a noncommercial medical marijuana collective garden, consistent with both RCW 69.51A.085 and the limitations set forth in this chapter, is allowed in the city’s residential zones where indicated in Table 17.16.020 and is subject to the terms set forth defining such use in Chapter 17.08 PTMC as well as the following conditions:

1. A collective garden is allowed in the R-I, R-II and R-III zones only on properties that contain a detached single-family residence. They are prohibited within attached single-family homes (duplex, triplex and fourplex), within the R-IV zone and within any multifamily dwelling (five or more units) with the exception of congregate care, assisted living, nursing, rest or convalescent homes as defined by this title where one collective garden may be operated on the premises of such uses, subject to the other provisions of this section.

2. A collective garden may occur within a legal, conforming accessory building to a detached single-family residence in the authorized zones.

3. Upon registration, the noncommercial collective garden must be able to demonstrate compliance with the applicable conditions of this chapter and the requirements of the building and fire code (Chapter 16.04 PTMC).

4. All collective garden cultivation authorized by this subsection shall adhere to the following operational standards:

a. Odor. The cannabis cultivation shall not subject residents of neighboring parcels who are of normal sensitivity to objectionable odors.

b. Lighting. All lights used for cannabis cultivation shall be shielded and downcast or otherwise positioned in a manner that will not allow it to extend beyond the boundaries of the parcel upon which the collective garden is located.

c. Noise. Operation of the collective garden shall not exceed the noise levels allowed under municipal code (Chapter 9.09 PTMC).

d. Visibility. Cannabis cultivated by the collective garden shall not be grown or on display in any location visible to the public from any public right-of-way or publicly owned property.

e. Signage. There shall be no exterior signage relating to the collective garden at the site.

f. Gas Prohibited. The use of gas products (CO2, butane, etc.) for the processing of medical cannabis is prohibited. (Ord. 3112 § 1 (Exh. B), 2014).


17.16.030 Bulk, dimensional and density requirements.

A. The standards contained in Table 17.16.030 apply to all residential zoning districts, and shall be determined to be minimum requirements, unless stated as maximum by this title.

B. Exceptions. The rear setbacks provided in Table 17.16.030 shall not apply to accessory structures smaller than 120 square feet in building coverage and 10 feet in height; provided, that all such accessory structures shall be a minimum of five feet from rear lot and/or property lines.

C. Setbacks and Minimum Yard Requirements. Notwithstanding any other ordinance or provision of this title, all setbacks (yard requirements) shall be measured from the lot line to the building line. In addition, there shall be a five-foot setback measured from the closest edge of a public or private easement for ingress or egress. Provided, however, that the roof or eaves of a roof of a building may extend beyond the building line a maximum distance of two feet into the applicable minimum yard area. “Lot line” for purposes of this section means the lot lines established for the lot by a plat, or subdivision, and does not include any line or boundary encompassing property that may be part of the lot or attached to the lot by reason of a street vacation resulting from the effect of statutory vacation (State of Washington Laws of 1889-1890, Chapter 19, section 32, “statutory vacation statute”). Easements include easements evidenced by conveyance, or recorded plat (unless extinguished by judicial determination and owner provides a copy of title insurance without any exceptions for easements whether or not of record title). 

D. Daylight Plane. In R-I and R-II zones, no structure shall extend above or beyond a daylight plane having a height of 15 feet measured at the property line and extending into the parcel at an angle of 45 degrees, with the following encroachments allowed:
[IMAGE]


1. Television and radio antennas, chimneys, flues, eaves, or skylights;

2. Dormers or similar architectural features; provided, that the horizontal length of all such features shall not exceed a combined total of 15 feet on each side, measured along the intersection with the daylight plane;


[IMAGE]


3. Gables or similar architectural features; provided, that the horizontal length of all such features shall not exceed a combined total of 18 feet on each side, measured along the intersection with the daylight plane; and provided, that the intersection of the gable with the daylight plane closest to the front property line is along the roof line;


[IMAGE]


4. Where the finished first floor of an existing dwelling is more than three feet above existing grade and is being extended by an addition, the initial height of the daylight plane shall be 12 feet for a single-story residence and 21.5 feet for two or more story residences;

5. Where the slope of a parcel measured between the side property lines at the front setback is 15 percent or steeper, the initial height of the daylight plane shall be 10 feet for a single-story residence and 21.5 feet for two or more story residences on the downhill side of the parcel; and


[IMAGE]


6. Where the slope of a parcel measured between the front and rearmost points of the structure is 15 percent or steeper, the daylight plane shall be measured at the front setback line and each 30 feet thereafter, and the height limits established at these points shall be extended horizontally to the next measurement point.


[IMAGE]


7. The daylight plane requirements do not apply to the side yards of a property contiguous with a right-of-way.

E. Fences. An owner, who provides the city satisfactory evidence of title to any right-of-way vacated by statutory vacation, may erect fences in accordance with the Port Townsend Municipal Code in the former right-of-way. Satisfactory evidence of title shall be a policy of title insurance or other documentation satisfactory to the city attorney that the owner owns the property in fee simple with no exceptions or encumbrances for easements, ingress or egress whether or not of record title. 

F. Construction and Permits. From and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, no building permit shall be issued and no building shall be constructed on any tract, lot or site in the city unless the building is situated on such tract, lot or site in conformance with the requirements of this title and any other applicable provision of law.

Chapter 17.18 MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS

Sections:

17.18.010    Purposes.

17.18.020    Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses.

17.18.030    Bulk, dimensional and density requirements.


17.18.010 Purposes.

A. Mixed Use Districts. The general purposes of the mixed use districts are as follows:

1. To foster a development pattern offering direct, convenient pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular access between residences and businesses, in order to facilitate pedestrian and bicycle travel and reduce the number and length of automobile trips;

2. To encourage new development that supports the safe and efficient movement of goods and people;

3. To provide for a compatible mix of single-family, multifamily housing and neighborhood commercial businesses and services, with an emphasis on promoting multistory structures with commercial uses on the ground floor and multifamily housing on upper floors;

4. To promote a compact growth pattern to efficiently use the remaining developable land, and to enable the cost-effective extension of utilities, services, and streets; frequent transit service; and to help sustain neighborhood businesses;

5. To foster the development of mixed use areas that are arranged, scaled, and designed to be compatible with surrounding land uses and which provide sensitive transitions between significantly different land uses (e.g., commercial and residential uses);

6. To ensure that buildings and other development components are arranged, designed, and oriented to facilitate pedestrian access.

B. The purposes of the specific mixed use districts are as follows:

1. C-I/MU – Neighborhood Mixed Use Center. This district provides for a compatible mix of small scale commercial uses and medium density multifamily housing in multistory buildings. Within this district, commercial uses should be located mainly on the ground floor of multistory structures, with multifamily residential units above, at a density of up to 16 units per 40,000-square-foot area. Over time, this district should promote neighborhood identity, by providing a range of commercial retail and service opportunities within walking distance, reducing reliance upon the automobile. This district occurs in three locations in the city: the southwest corner of the intersection of 49th Street and Jackman; the Hastings and Howard Street intersection; and the San Juan and F Street intersection.

2. C-II/MU – Community Mixed Use Center. While very similar to the neighborhood mixed use district, this district accommodates a broader range of commercial uses and upper floor multifamily residential units at a density of up to 24 units per 40,000 square foot area. The C-II/MU district occurs in areas that are closer to the city’s existing east/west commercial corridor (i.e., portions of both the east and west sides of Discovery Road, from 7th Street to 12th Street; and the east side of Kearney Street, from Franklin to Garfield Street). Like the C-I/MU district, the C-II/MU district is intended to promote more focused and transit or pedestrian-oriented development patterns. (Ord. 3154 §§ 4(2) (Exh. D), 4(9) (Exh. K), 2016; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.18.020 Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses.

A. Table 17.18.020 identifies land uses in the mixed use zoning districts that are permitted outright (P), subject to a conditional use permit (C), prohibited (X), or not applicable (N/A). However, notwithstanding the fact that a use may be permitted outright, additional permits may be required for certain projects. Uses not specifically identified within Table 17.18.020 are deemed to be contrary to the interests of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Port Townsend and shall be prohibited.

B. Requirements for the uses identified in Table 17.18.020 which are contained within other provisions of this title are referenced under the heading “applicable regulations/ notes,” although this should not be construed as comprehensive listing of all provisions of this title which may apply to any given use. Specifically, the provisions of Chapter 17.72 PTMC, Off-Street Parking and Loading, and Chapter 17.76 PTMC, Signs, shall apply to all uses, even if not noted in Table 17.18.020.

C. Incidental uses which are identified in this title as prohibited or conditional uses within the applicable zoning district shall be considered conditional and processed in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC subject to the approval criteria codified in Chapter 17.84 PTMC.

Chapter 17.20 COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS

Sections:

17.20.010    Purposes.

17.20.020    Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses – Limitations on use.

17.20.025    Design review required.

17.20.030    Bulk, dimensional and density requirements.


17.20.010 Purposes.

A. The general purposes of the commercial districts are as follows:

1. To provide appropriate commercial areas for retail and service establishments, neighborhood convenience and office uses required by residents of the city in a manner consistent with the comprehensive plan;

2. To provide employment opportunities for existing and future residents of the city and those of adjacent communities;

3. To provide for land uses which meet the needs of local populations and attract populations located throughout the northeastern Olympic Peninsula;

4. To provide adequate space to meet the needs of commercial development, including off-street parking and loading;

5. To protect commercial and adjacent areas from excessive noise, illumination, unsightliness, odor, smoke, and other objectionable influences;

6. To provide for an intensity of development and activity within commercial areas which will increase their vitality, facilitate transit, and make better use of available infrastructure;

7. To accommodate a balanced mix of commercial, residential, and recreational uses in commercial areas which will enable people to live, shop, work, and play within walking distance; thereby reducing dependence on motor vehicles and potentially reducing traffic congestion, energy consumption, and air pollution.

B. The purpose of each commercial district is as follows:

1. C-I – Neighborhood Commercial. This is an exclusively neighborhood commercial district, providing convenience shopping and small retail establishments which offer a limited range of goods and services within a residential neighborhood. The district allows for the retailing of neighborhood commodities and the provision of neighborhood professional and personal services. It should be located not less than one-half mile from another neighborhood commercial district, or any other commercial district providing similar services or facilities. Neighborhood commercial districts are intended to have a maximum size of no more than one acre. The size, scale, and expansion of such areas should be limited in order to minimize traffic volumes and congestion and other adverse impacts on the neighborhood in which these districts are located. The C-I district has been applied to the southwest corner of the intersection of Kearney and Blaine Streets.

2. C-II – General Commercial. This district accommodates a wide range of general commercial uses. This district provides for those commercial uses and activities which are most heavily dependent on convenient vehicular access, and is located on sites having safe and efficient access to major transportation routes. Uses allowed within this district include retail businesses, professional offices, hotels, restaurants, and personal services shops. Upper-story residential uses are permitted outright. This district occupies more area of the city than any other commercial district, and occurs in various locations along Sims Way, Washington Street and Water Street, and in the triangular area bounded by SR 20 to the south, Howard Street to the east, and Discovery Road to the northwest.

3. C-II(H) – Hospital Commercial. This district permits the clustering of interrelated and complementary health care facilities. This district accommodates medical clinics, offices, pharmacies, nursing homes, and other medical-related uses in areas close to major medical facilities. Accessory or supporting uses which provide convenience services primarily to medical facility users and employees are also allowed. This district occurs in areas near Jefferson General Hospital, between Sims Way and 11th Street, and the Kah Tai Care Center on the west side of Kearney Street.

4. C-III – Historic Commercial. This district is intended to accommodate the mix of uses that have occurred over time in the city’s downtown and uptown historic districts. The district makes provision for general retail uses on the ground floor of structures, and promotes a mix of uses on the upper floors of historic buildings, including: residences; artist and craft studios; and professional offices. The district is intended to permit development of a scale, type, height, and bulk which reinforces the city’s historic character, buildings, places, and street layout. It is designed to promote pedestrian-oriented land uses and design consistent with the character of the city’s historic districts. (Ord. 3154 §§ 4(3) (Exh. E), 4(9) (Exh. K), 2016; Ord. 2825 § 4, 2003; Ord. 2716 § 4.6, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.20.020 Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses – Limitations on use.

A. Table 17.20.020 identifies land uses in the commercial zoning districts that are permitted outright (P), subject to a conditional use permit (C), subject to the specific conditional use requirements for uses in commercial historic structures contained in PTMC 17.84.060 (H), prohibited (X), or not applicable (N/A). However, notwithstanding the fact that a use may be permitted outright, additional permits may be required for certain projects. Uses not specifically identified within Table 17.20.020 are deemed to be contrary to the interests of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Port Townsend and shall be prohibited.

B. Requirements for the uses identified in Table 17.20.020 which are contained within other provisions of this title are referenced under the heading “applicable regulations/ notes,” although this should not be construed as a comprehensive listing of all provisions of this title which may apply to any given use. Specifically, the provisions of Chapter 17.72 PTMC, Off-Street Parking and Loading, and Chapter 17.76 PTMC, Signs, shall apply to all uses, even if not noted in Table 17.20.020.

C. Lighting Requirements in Commercial Zoning Districts. Where lighted signs and illuminated areas are permitted, such illuminating devices shall be shaded and directed so as not to provide glare toward any residential district (i.e., R-I, R-II, R-III and R-IV).

D. Incidental uses which are identified in this title as prohibited or conditional uses within the applicable zoning district shall be considered conditional and processed in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC subject to the approval criteria codified in Chapter 17.84 PTMC.

Chapter 17.22 MARINE-RELATED AND MANUFACTURING ZONING DISTRICTS

Sections:

17.22.010    Purposes.

17.22.020    Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses – Limitations on use.

17.22.030    Bulk, dimensional and density requirements.


17.22.010 Purposes.

A. The general purposes of the marine-related and manufacturing districts are as follows:

1. To permit a variety of manufacturing and marine-related uses in limited and appropriate areas, which if located elsewhere would be unacceptable;

2. To protect residential and other nonmanufacturing and nonmarine areas from adverse and damaging impacts emanating from manufacturing-type or marine-related activities;

3. To protect manufacturing and marine-related areas from other uses that may interfere with the purpose and efficient operation of these areas;

4. To promote economic diversification and provide for employment opportunities for present and future residents;

5. To protect the viability of water-dependent manufacturing enterprises by ensuring adequate and appropriate areas for locating marine-related activities.

B. The purposes of each specific manufacturing and marine-related district are as follows:

1. M/C – Mixed Light Manufacturing and Commercial. This district accommodates small-scale manufacturing businesses, along with associated and subordinate on-site retailing. The purpose of this district is to provide for manufacturing and commercial enterprises which do not predominate within either the light manufacturing or commercial land use categories. These are uses which may combine aspects of both on-site manufacturing and retailing (e.g., specialty crafts or artisans). Manufacturing to commercial floor area ratios are necessary for this district to ensure that certain uses do not dominate at the expense of others. The M/C district occurs in areas south of Sims Way and west of Thomas Street. The district may also be appropriate for significant portions of the Glen Cove area.

2. M-I – Light Manufacturing. The M-I district provides for light manufacturing, processing, fabrication, and assembly of products and materials, warehousing and storage, and transportation facilities. This district has not been applied to any areas within the city, although it may be appropriate for portions of the Glen Cove area.

3. M-II(A) (Boat Haven) – Marine-Related Uses. This district accommodates a variety of uses including marina, recreational boating, manufacturing, assembly, haul out, and repair. The M-IIA district occurs primarily on port-owned lands at the Boat Haven. It is intended for larger scale and more intensive water-dependent or marine-related uses at the Boat Haven. Uses within the district that also lie within the jurisdiction of the Port Townsend shoreline master program (i.e., within 200 feet of the shoreline) are subject to the policies and standards of both this title and the Port Townsend shoreline master program.

4. M-II(B) (Point Hudson) – Marine-Related Uses. Similar to the M-IIA district, this district accommodates a variety of marine-related uses, but on a less intensive scale, appropriate to Point Hudson. This district promotes mixed use projects which incorporate water-oriented uses, consistent with the historic, marine-related character of the area. Within certain eligible buildings, a limited range of non-water-oriented uses are allowed as a means to promote adaptive reuse of the original Point Hudson Station buildings. Uses within this district that also lie within the jurisdiction of the Port Townsend shoreline master program (i.e., within 200 feet of the shoreline) are subject to the policies and standards of both this title and the Port Townsend shoreline master program.

5. M-III – Heavy Manufacturing. The M-III district accommodates heavy manufacturing activities including processing, fabrication, assembling of products or materials, and bulk storage. This district is intended to provide for the continuation and development of heavy manufacturing enterprises in locations where they will be compatible with other similar uses, and which do not negatively impact adjacent land uses. This district has not been applied to any areas within the city, although it may be appropriate for portions of the Glen Cove area. An example includes, but is not limited to, the Port Townsend Paper Mill. (Ord. 3154 § 4(4) (Exh. F), 2016; Ord. 2945 § 5.6, 2007; Ord. 2825 § 4, 2003; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.22.020 Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses – Limitations on use.

A. Table 17.22.020 identifies land uses in the marine-related and manufacturing zoning districts that are permitted outright (P), permitted in the M-II(A) and M-II(B) zoning districts if marine-related (M), subject to a conditional use permit (C), prohibited (X), or not applicable (N/A). However, notwithstanding the fact that a use may be permitted outright, additional permits may be required for certain projects. Uses not specifically identified within Table 17.22.020 are deemed to be contrary to the interests of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Port Townsend and shall be prohibited. Marine-related uses are the goods and services which are primarily intended to support boating, sailing, water sports, marine research, or similar activities.

B. Requirements for the uses identified in Table 17.22.020 which are contained within other provisions of this title are referenced under the heading “applicable regulations/ notes,” although this should not be construed as a comprehensive listing of all provisions of this title which may apply to any given use. Specifically, the provisions of Chapter 17.72 PTMC, Off-Street Parking and Loading, and Chapter 17.76 PTMC, Signs, shall apply to all uses, even if not noted in Table 17.22.020.

C. Limitations on Use – Buffering Requirements. All sites in marine-related and manufacturing districts (i.e., M/C, M-I, M-II, M-II(A), M-II(B) and M-III) having a common boundary with residential districts (i.e., R-I, R-II, R-III and R-IV) shall have planted and maintained along such common boundary a view-obscuring greenbelt of shrubs, trees and native vegetation, which will grow to not less than eight feet in height nor less than 10 feet in width within five years, for screening purposes and controlling access.

D. Limitations on Use – General Requirements. Marine-related and manufacturing uses shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Noise. In all marine-related and manufacturing districts (i.e., M/C, M-I, M-II, M II(A), M-II(B) and M-III), the construction and operation of facilities and uses shall follow best management practices so as to minimize unnecessary conflicts with and impacts to adjacent nonindustrial land or water uses to the extent practicable given the intended use and zoning. Also see PTMC 9.09.040(D) for exemptions applicable to the M-II(A) and M-II(B) zoning districts.

2. Light and Glare. Exterior lighting shall not be used in such a manner that produces glare on public streets or roads and neighboring property. Arc welding, acetylene torch cutting or similar processes shall be performed so as not to be seen from any point beyond the outside of the property.

3. Fire and Safety Hazards.

a. The storage and handling of inflammable liquids, liquefied petroleum gases and explosives shall comply with rules and regulations falling under the jurisdiction of the city fire chief, the laws of the state and other local ordinances;

b. Bulk storage of inflammable liquids below ground shall be permitted, and the tank shall be located not closer to the property line than the greatest dimension (diameter, length, or height) of the tank.

4. Interferences. Provisions must be made for necessary shielding or other preventive measures against interferences occasioned by mechanical or electrical equipment, uses or processes with electrical apparatus in nearby buildings or land uses.

5. Waste Products. Liquid and solid wastes, storage of animal or vegetable waste which attract insects or rodents or otherwise create a health hazard shall be prohibited. No waste products shall be exposed to view from eye level from any property line in a marine-related or manufacturing district (i.e., M/C, M-I, M-II, M-II(A), M-II(B) and M-III).

E. Incidental uses which are identified in this title as prohibited or conditional uses within the applicable zoning district shall be considered conditional and processed in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC subject to the approval criteria codified in Chapter 17.84 PTMC.

Sections:

17.24.010    Purposes.

17.24.020    Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses.

17.24.025    Alternative parcel-specific zoning.

17.24.030    Bulk, dimensional and density requirements.


17.24.010 Purposes.

A. The general purposes of the public, park, and open space districts are as follows:

1. To provide opportunities for existing and future outdoor recreational activities;

2. To preserve scenic qualities and resources and provide contrasts to the built environment;

3. To protect environmentally sensitive areas;

4. To provide adequate opportunities for location of existing and future public utilities, facilities, and services;

5. To preserve the function, capacity, and water quality of the city’s stormwater drainage system.

B. The specific purposes of each individual public, park, and open space district are as follows:

1. P/OS – Existing Park and Open Space. This district has been applied to existing city, county, and state-owned parks, recreation areas, and city-owned or controlled lands which provide valuable natural and open space functions.

2. P/OS(B) – Mixed Public/Infrastructure/Open Space. This district occurs on lands used to provide public utilities, facilities, and services which also provide valuable natural and open space functions. Allowed uses include stormwater detention facilities and wastewater treatment facilities.

3. P-I – Public/Infrastructure. This district occurs on lands used to provide public utilities, facilities, and services. Allowed uses include, schools, libraries, public utilities, and government buildings. (Ord. 3154 § 4(5) (Exh. G), 2016; Ord. 2700 § 21, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.24.020 Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses.

A. Table 17.24.020 identifies land uses in the public, park and open space zoning districts that are permitted outright (P), subject to a conditional use permit (C), prohibited (X), or not applicable (N/A). However, notwithstanding the fact that a use may be permitted outright, additional permits may be required for certain projects. Uses not specifically identified within Table 17.24.020 are deemed to be contrary to the interests of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Port Townsend and shall be prohibited.

B. Requirements for the uses identified in Table 17.24.020 which are contained within other provisions of this title are referenced under the heading “applicable regulations/notes,” although this should not be construed as a comprehensive listing of all provisions of this title which may apply to any given use. Specifically, the provisions of Chapter 17.72 PTMC, Off-Street Parking and Loading, and Chapter 17.76 PTMC, Signs, shall apply to all uses, even if not noted in Table 17.24.020.

C. Incidental uses which are identified in this title as prohibited or conditional uses within the applicable zoning district shall be considered conditional and processed in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC subject to the approval criteria codified in Chapter 17.84 PTMC.

Article I. Design Review


17.30.010 Purpose and intent. 

The city council finds and declares as a matter of public policy that the preservation, protection, and enhancement of buildings, structures and improvements of historical, cultural, architectural, engineering, political, or social significance located within the Port Townsend historic overlay district (the overlay district) and throughout the city are required in the interest of the prosperity, civic pride and general welfare of the citizens of the city. The city council further finds that the aesthetic, cultural and economic standing of Port Townsend would be threatened by disregarding the heritage of the city and by allowing the destruction or defacement of such buildings and structures. Accordingly, the purposes of this chapter are to:

A. Preserve and protect the buildings and structures located in the overlay district that reflect significant elements of the city’s historical, cultural, architectural, engineering, political, social or other heritage;

B. Foster knowledge and civic pride in the beauty, accomplishments, and living heritage of the past;

C. Preserve and encourage harmonious architectural styles within the overlay district that reflect the distinct phases of Port Townsend’s history;

D. Promote the use of historic buildings and structures within the overlay district for the economic prosperity, education, inspiration and general welfare of the people of the city;

E. Promote and encourage continued ownership and use of historic buildings and structures within the overlay district to further the objectives of this chapter;

F. Protect the attractiveness of Port Townsend to residents and visitors;

G. Assist, encourage and provide incentives to owners for preservation, restoration, redevelopment and use of historic buildings, structures, objects and sites;

H. Promote and facilitate the early identification and resolution of conflicts between the preservation of historic resources and alternative land uses;

I. Conserve valuable material and energy resources by ongoing use and maintenance of the existing built environment;

J. New development should foster a mix of businesses that serve the Port Townsend community and others, and that provide living wages;

K. New development should provide an attractive pedestrian-oriented environment free from intrusions unless they are consistent with design review, be constructed of quality materials, and reduce the impacts of off-site parking;

L. Implement the goals and policies of the Port Townsend comprehensive plan to preserve the unique character, vitality and economic prosperity of the overlay district, including the diversity and unique characteristics of the waterfront and uptown subdistricts located therein, and to “encourage the retention of significant historic and cultural resources which foster community identity and pride”;

M. Amendments to this chapter may require corollary amendments to the city of Port Townsend shoreline master program for consistency. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2945 § 5.8, 2007; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.015 Reasonable use.

A. In no event shall the application of this chapter be applied to prevent a reasonable beneficial use or reasonable economic return to the owner without the proposed alteration, construction, removal or demolition.

B. An owner may apply to the director for modification of the requirements of this chapter on the basis that application of this chapter would prevent a reasonable beneficial use or reasonable economic return without the proposed alteration, relocation, removal or demolition.

The application shall be processed as an application for certificate of approval pursuant to PTMC 17.30.080. In addition, an owner shall provide an explanation with supporting evidence of how and why compliance with this chapter would prevent a reasonable beneficial use or reasonable economic return without the proposed alteration, relocation, removal or demolition.

The director may require information and documentation, including:

1. Nature of ownership;

2. Financial resources of owner or parties in interest;

3. Cost of repairs;

4. Assessed value of the land and improvements;

5. Debt service;

6. Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and offers received, if any;

7. For income-producing property, itemized operating and maintenance expenses, and annual cash flow, for previous two years.

C. The director may approve an exception and modify a requirement of this chapter only when all of the following findings can be made:

1. The application of this chapter would prevent a reasonable beneficial use or reasonable economic return without the proposed alteration, relocation, removal or demolition, and there is no viable or reasonable alternative which would have less impact;

2. The basis on which the application is made is not the result of actions by the owner.

The director shall take into account relevant factors, including: (1) if denial of the application would result in a substantial decrease in the fair market value of the property; (2) the structural soundness of any structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation; (3) the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure or improvement on the property in the case of proposed demolition; (4) the cost of the proposed alteration, relocation or demolition; and (5) if denial of the application would result in a substantial decrease in the return to owners in the property.

D. A requirement of this chapter may be reduced, waived or otherwise modified only to the extent necessary to make the standard reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case. In modifying a development standard the director may impose reasonable conditions that prevent or mitigate the same harm that the modified regulation was intended to prevent or mitigate.

E. Appeals of a decision of the director to grant, deny, or attach conditions pursuant to this section shall be made in accordance with the appeal provisions set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC for Type I-A decisions (administrative approval, with appeal by applicant or party of record to the hearing examiner). In making its decision on the appeal, the hearing examiner shall accord substantial weight to the decision of the director. In the event the hearing examiner denies the appeal and affirms the decision of the director, the hearing examiner shall adopt written findings of fact and conclusions in support of its decision. In order to grant any appeal from the decision of the director, the hearing examiner must find that the decision was clearly erroneous or that the director failed to adhere to the standards established by this chapter. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Unless exempted by this chapter (see PTMC 17.30.020), no development or improvement regulated under this chapter may be initiated without design review and (as required by this chapter) recommendation by the historic preservation committee (HPC) and issuance of a certificate of approval by the director, except, as provided by this section, minor alterations and permits are administratively reviewed and approved by the director without HPC review and recommendation. Design review for alterations and changes to secondary residential structures requires a certificate of approval, but does not require HPC recommendation.

B. Minor Alterations and Permits. Minor alterations and permits that are administratively approved include:

1. Repairs or restoration of historic features or elements.

2. Changes in roofing and/or siding material.

3. Replacement in kind (or substantially in kind) of windows using the same or similar sash and pane configuration, including use of compatible substitute materials.

4. New railings.

5. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations.

6. Fences.

7. Garages and outbuildings including modifications to existing contributing or non-contributing accessory structures.

8. New additions to contributing residential structures resulting in less than a 50 percent increase in gross square footage; provided, that the addition is limited to the nonprincipal facades.

9. Sign permits.

10. Exterior mechanical equipment (heat pumps, propane tanks, roof vents, etc.).

11. Temporary, removable tables, chairs and benches located within public rights-of-way.

12. Installation of awnings that adhere to the city’s adopted awning guidelines.

13. Installation of exterior lighting including light poles.

14. Installation of garbage and recycling enclosures.

15. Noncommercial communication antennas and equipment.

Nothing prevents the director from obtaining HPC recommendation on the proposed minor alteration, and/or working with HPC to establish guidelines to implement applications for minor alterations.

C. Review of any alteration proposed to secondary residential structures, with the exception of demolition or partial demolition, may be performed administratively by the DSD director without consultation and recommendation by the HPC.

D. Modification of HPC Recommendations. Based upon the information provided by the applicant and developed by HPC, and based further upon any formally adopted city code, plans and policies as may be applicable, the director has the authority to modify the recommendation of the HPC. If the director modifies a recommendation, it shall be for good cause set forth in writing, and the director shall promptly notify HPC of any modification.

E. Limitations on Permits. No city permits or approvals shall be issued for any development or municipal improvement regulated under this chapter absent issuance of a certificate of approval by the director.

F. Certificate of Approval Binding upon Applicant. Upon issuance by the director, the conditions attached to the certificate of approval shall become binding upon the applicant and any agent or representative of the applicant for applications within the historic overlay district.

G. SEPA Authority. In addition to the requirements of this section, the city retains substantive authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW) to review, condition or deny any proposed development or municipal improvement based upon the identification of probable, significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposal. (Ord. 3070 § 1, 2011; Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.070 Preapplication conference mandatory. 

All applications for design review and a certificate of approval under this chapter that involve new construction or a new addition to an existing building shall not be accepted by the director unless the project proponent has scheduled and attended a preapplication conference with development services department staff and a representative of the HPC (except for alterations or changes to secondary residential, which do not require HPC review and recommendation). The purpose of the preapplication conference is to acquaint the project proponent with the requirements of this chapter and to provide preliminary comments on the acceptability of the proposed design. The director may waive this preapplication conference requirement if an applicant demonstrates, to the director’s satisfaction, experience with the requirements of the PTMC requirements and process that would render the preapplication conference unnecessary. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-6 § 2), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.080 Application for certificate of approval. 

A. Filing. Application for a certificate of approval shall be made by filing an application for such certificate with the development services department.

B. General Application Submittal Requirements. To be considered complete, an application for a certificate of approval under this chapter shall include the following:

1. A completed application on a form prescribed by the development services department, prepared in consultation with the HPC, accompanied by a site plan showing the location of the building or buildings, parking, exterior lighting, signs and landscaping, exterior elevations of the front, rear and side of the building or other improvements with a description of the type and finished color of exterior siding, signage, exterior hardware, windows and roofing to be used.

2. Detailed drawings of architectural features, signs and trim; and “as is” photographs of the subject building or site and adjacent structures.

3. All diagrams, drawings and plans shall be drawn to scale. The HPC may request additional information necessary for their review and recommendation.

4. Evidence that the application is made by or on behalf of the owner.

The DSD director may limit the submittal requirements to only those necessary for review of the proposal. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.090 Timing of application submittals. 

Immediately upon issuance of a determination of completeness for any permits required under any other chapters of this title, an environmental determination under PTMC Title 19, or a substantial development permit under the Port Townsend shoreline master program, an applicant for a development or municipal improvement regulated under this chapter shall submit an application for design review and certificate of approval. All such submittals shall be made at least 60 days prior to the first hearing of the hearings body conducting any open record public hearing on the proposed development. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.100 HPC process – Review and recommendation to director required. 

This section applies to completed applications for a certificate of approval, except it does not apply to completed applications for a certificate of approval for alterations or changes to secondary residential structures, which do not require HPC review and recommendation.

A. Director’s Responsibilities. Upon receipt of a completed application for a certificate of approval, the director shall:

1. Inform the applicant of the review requirements;

2. Report receipt of the application to the HPC and forward the application to its members;

3. Assist the HPC in considering the design guidelines, building, zoning, shoreline, sign and fire code and other regulatory requirements which may apply to the proposed development or municipal improvement; and

4. Refrain from issuing any building permit prior to issuance of a certificate of approval for the proposed development or municipal improvement, which shall occur only after consideration of the HPC’s findings, conclusions and recommendation.

B. HPC Meeting Required. The director, in consultation with the HPC, shall set a public meeting time and place as soon as possible to review the application according to the design review standards established in this chapter. The director shall request the applicant, and any design professionals assisting the applicant, to attend the meeting. If the applicant, or the applicant’s representative responsible for project design, fails to attend the meeting, an alternate meeting shall be scheduled by the HPC within 30 days of the initial meeting, and the director shall provide the applicant with written notification of the continued meeting; provided, that in such event, the duration of time between the originally scheduled meeting and the continued meeting shall be considered time necessary for the city to obtain additional information on the application, in accordance with PTMC 20.01.110. In the event the applicant fails to attend the continued meeting, the director, upon providing written notification to the applicant of the continued meeting, shall determine the application to be abandoned and withdrawn. Where the director deems an application to be abandoned and withdrawn, no permits shall be issued by the city on the project unless and until the applicant has applied anew for design review and obtained a certificate of approval under this chapter.

C. Additional HPC Meetings. The HPC, in coordination with the applicant, may schedule additional meetings as it may find necessary and desirable to complete its review and formulate findings, conclusions and recommendations for the advice of the director. The HPC may, in the execution of its review, assign any portion of the review of any application to any member or subcommittee of the HPC; provided, that the vote approving the findings, conclusions and recommendation regarding the application for the certificate of approval shall be made by a majority vote of a quorum of the HPC.

D. Phased Review. Upon approval of the DSD director, applications may be processed in phases; provided, however, that phased review shall only be allowed if review of phases provides adequate review of the project.

E. HPC Recommendations – Contents. When the HPC has completed its review, it shall forward its findings, conclusions and recommendation to the director.

1. The HPC’s recommendation shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following information: the name of the applicant; the date the recommendation is issued; the location of the proposed development or municipal improvement; a brief narrative description of the development or municipal improvement; specific reference to any and all plans submitted by the applicant showing, if applicable, the design which the HPC has found to be consistent with adopted design standards; a statement as to whether or not the HPC finds the proposed development or municipal improvement to be contributing or not contributing to the historic overlay district and specific subdistrict in which it is located, if applicable; and any and all specific design elements and/or conditions of approval recommended by the HPC. The HPC shall also document any voluntary revisions that the applicant has made as a result of the HPC review.

2. In the event the HPC recommends that the director attach conditions upon the certificate of approval that have not been agreed to by the applicant, or in the event that the HPC recommends denial of the application, the HPC’s transmittal to the director shall include detailed findings and conclusions supporting the recommended conditions or denial, with specific reference made to the formally adopted design standards supporting the recommendation. For the purpose of this chapter, plans, policies, rules and design guidelines are “formally adopted” when adopted by ordinance of the Port Townsend city council, or incorporated by reference within an ordinance of the city council.

3. Upon approval of HPC, HPC may appoint a subcommittee of its members to provide recommendation on matters involving clarifications of HPC recommendations, or minor issues or matters that are not inconsistent with HPC recommendations.

F. Time Limit for HPC Review and Recommendation. Unless an extension is authorized by the applicant, the HPC shall complete its review and forward its findings, conclusions and recommendation to the director within 45 days of receipt of a complete application for a certificate of approval, consistent with PTMC 20.01.120. In the event that the HPC fails to issue its recommendation within such period, the director shall issue a certificate of approval without the recommendation of the HPC.

G. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a decision on the subsequent phase or phases of the project, and any deadlines for decisions on related permit applications under review by the department, and the applicant agrees in writing that the director’s decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include information sufficient for review. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design which shall be substantially consistent with the approved preliminary design. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.110 Certificate of approval – Director’s decision. 

A. Director’s Written Decision. Upon their receipt, the director shall deliberate upon the HPC’s findings, conclusions and recommendations, according great weight to the same. The director shall then issue a written decision granting, granting with conditions, or denying a certificate of approval based upon the HPC’s recommendations (when required), and shall provide a copy of the decision to the applicant not later than 14 days after receipt of the HPC’s recommendation (when required).

B. Certificate of Approval – Contents. The certificate of approval issued by the director shall include, at a minimum, the information contained within the HPC’s findings, conclusions and recommendation (when required), shall plainly state whether the HPC’s recommendations are approved with, or without, modifications and shall include a finding or findings that the decision is based upon formally adopted design standards and/or the voluntary agreement of the applicant. The director may request that the applicant sign the certificate acknowledging that the applicant agrees to accept the conditions of approval.

C. Certificate of Approval – Effect If Alteration Results in Residential Reclassification. To avoid penalizing an owner of a residence from undertaking alterations that result in an upgrade to the classification of the residence, a certificate of approval for a residence shall provide that a future alteration, applied for within 10 years from the issuance of the certificate of approval, would be reviewed based on the residence’s classification before the alteration for which the certificate is issued; provided, this only applies if the owner has not received special valuation or other monetary benefits in connection with the alterations associated with the certificate of approval. The director may document this provision by notice to title. Nothing prevents an owner, who has not received special valuation or other monetary benefits associated with the certificate of approval in connection with the alterations, from executing a covenant that declares the owner’s acceptance of an upgrade to the classification of the residence and waiving the provisions of this subsection.

For example, an owner of a secondary residence upgrades the residence which results in the residence now being classified as primary. A future alteration (for example, an addition) applied for within 10 years would be reviewed as if the residence was secondary (allowing more latitude than if the residence were primary), so long as the owner had not received special valuation or other monetary benefits in connection with the alterations associated with the certificate of approval. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.120 Issuance of certificate of approval – Effect on other permits or approvals. 

A. Issuance of a certificate of approval by the director does not constitute or imply approval of any other permit or approval which may be required for the development. For Type II and Type III applications requiring design review and issuance of a certificate of approval in accordance with this chapter, the certificate of approval shall be included in the staff report and recommendation transmitted to the decisionmaker or hearing body pursuant to PTMC 20.01.220. Upon approval by the designated decisionmaker or hearing body, the certificate of approval issued by the director shall be incorporated by reference within, and constitute a component of the conditions and requirements of any other permit issued by the city.

B. No provision of this chapter shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the hearing body or decisionmaking body to impose conditions as authorized elsewhere in this title, or in accordance with any formally adopted plans, regulations or policies of the city, including but not limited to PTMC Title 19, Environmental Protection.

C. Any development or municipal improvements subject to the provisions set forth in this chapter shall also be subject to the use, bulk, dimensional and density requirements contained elsewhere in this title, all other applicable provisions of this title, and any other applicable provisions of state or local laws, rules, regulations or ordinances.

D. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as delegating either the HPC or its committees with any quasi-judicial, executive or legislative power, authority or responsibility. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.130 Appeals. 

A. Process. Appeals of a decision of the director to grant, deny, or attach conditions to a certificate of approval shall be made in accordance with the appeal provisions set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC for Type I-A decisions (administrative approval, with appeal by applicant or party of record to the hearing examiner).

B. Standard of Review. In making its decision on the appeal, the hearing examiner shall accord substantial weight to the decision of the director. In the event the hearing examiner denies the appeal and affirms the decision of the director, the hearing examiner shall adopt written findings of fact and conclusions in support of its decision. In order to grant any appeal from the decision of the director, the hearing examiner must find that the decision was clearly erroneous or that the director failed to adhere to the design standards established by this chapter. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.140 Historic overlay district and historic places – Design standards.

In reviewing development or municipal improvements subject to this chapter, the HPC and the director shall apply, and development or improvements construction shall follow and conform with the following standards, as applicable:

A. The Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings” (1995), including all amendments;

B. The Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings” (1997), including all amendments;

C. Developments or municipal improvements regulated by this chapter that are located in the downtown historic commercial C-III district should also be subject to the guidelines contained in “Water Street Historic District: A Field Report of the National Trust for Historic Preservation,” reprinted in 1977;

D. The waterfront subdistrict design review standards set forth in PTMC 17.30.150;

E. The uptown commercial subdistrict guidelines set forth in PTMC 17.30.155;

F. The historic residential design guidelines as set forth in PTMC 17.30.158; and

G. The standards, where applicable, that are contained within the historic preservation design guidelines manual adopted pursuant to PTMC 17.30.160. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2871 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.150 Waterfront subdistrict – Additional design standards. 

In its review of development or municipal improvements occurring within the waterfront subdistrict of the historic overlay district, the HPC and the director shall apply the following design standards in addition to those set forth in PTMC 17.30.140.

A. General Standards.

1. City Form.

a. Designs should acknowledge the role of the shoreline and the bluff as the traditional determinants of the form of the city’s development by preserving and continuing the linear organization of the city between the shoreline and the bluff.

b. Designs should assist the redirection of the city’s focus to the waterfront by enhancing public access to the waterfront, creating public open spaces oriented to the waterfront, and encouraging waterfront uses and activities which are consistent with the carrying capacities of the aquatic environment.

c. New buildings or redeveloped buildings shall preserve and enhance the city’s pyramidal form through compliance with the special height overlay district regulations set forth in Chapter 17.28 PTMC.

d. New development or redevelopment shall follow and enhance the unique character of its environs through compliance with the design standards set forth for the specific waterfront subdistricts set forth in subsection B of this section.

e. New development should recognize the city’s historic architectural heritage through the use of building materials, construction methods, building proportions and architectural devices compatible with those used in existing buildings, but should not attempt to replicate existing historical buildings.

f. In the development of streets and parking areas, functional requirements for vehicular movement and parking should not compromise the safety of or inhibit the movement of pedestrians. Streets should have easy and well-marked pedestrian crossings. Parking lots should be small, incremental, well-lit and secure. Pedestrian movement should be enhanced through the location of landscaping, lighting and signage.

2. City Connections.

a. Property owners are encouraged to make available areas within and around developments where monuments and markers can be established by the city to commemorate historic people and events, mark places of urban celebration, and give visual orientation to users of the city.

b. Designs shall protect views of the water and the bluff through compliance with the shoreline master program, the special height overlay district regulations set forth in Chapter 17.28 PTMC, and other design standards established pursuant to this chapter.

c. Any new development or redevelopment of properties adjacent to the shoreline shall comply with the policies and performance standards of the shoreline master program and the Washington State Department of Ecology Shorelands and Coastal Zone Management Program Shoreline Public Access Handbook, relating to visual and pedestrian access to and along the waterfront. In furtherance of those policies, public access to and along the waterfront should be coordinated and linked with other public access to create a continuous public walkway along the waterfront described in the plan as the “Waterwalk.”

d. Designs should include and incorporate visual and physical connections between pedestrian spaces and public access areas which encourage easy and inviting movement between adjoining spaces. Designs should incorporate views through developments, where feasible.

e. Any redevelopment of existing public rights-of-way and public access connections along the bluff line should preserve, create and enhance vehicular and pedestrian connections between the downtown and uptown areas of the city. Where these conflict, pedestrian considerations should prevail.

3. Civic Spaces.

a. Streets should be designed to function as public open spaces bordered by buildings, in addition to facilitating traffic movement. Buildings should be designed to enhance the pedestrian experience through the use of such features as building articulation (i.e., variations in building materials, surface texture, windows, doors, porches and other facade features), landscaping, lighting and signage without encumbering the efficient movement and parking of vehicles.

b. Development at street intersections should enhance intersections in ways that extend beyond functional needs through the location of building entries and the incorporation of building details, street lighting, landscaping and signage which respect and conform to the character of existing structures at the intersection.

c. Designs are encouraged to make natural areas and open space accessible to the public in ways that do not destroy or endanger wildlife habitats or water quality. Designs should utilize lighting, furniture and landscaping in a way that natural areas and open spaces can be used in a safe and secure manner. Where possible through public/private partnerships, vacant lots within the city, until developed, should be made available as parks and courtyards which are accessible to citizens and visitors.

d. Open spaces and enclosed or sheltered public spaces should be designed to be flexible and to accommodate a variety of functions, including both organized use, such as outdoor concerts and group gatherings, and casual use.

e. Public open spaces created within the urban waterfront area should incorporate appropriate landscape and hardscape elements in accordance with the character of the subdistrict and the natural environment within which the development is being designed.

f. Street furniture, lighting and signage should be designed in accordance with the character and predominant theme of the subdistrict in which it is located.

4. New Buildings.

a. New construction should preserve and continue the traditional block development pattern of the city by creating buildings that follow in scale and proportion the traditional modularity of existing block faces with buildings constructed to street property lines and main access from the street. In areas immediately adjacent to traditional blocks where the traditional block pattern has not been followed, new development and redevelopment should be designed with the same scale and proportions as would be found within the traditional block pattern with buildings constructed to the property line and main access from the street.

b. New structures built between or among existing structures should reflect the principles of design of the surrounding buildings in proportion, composition and detail. To accomplish these goals, building designs should adhere to the following: proportions of the facade should be similar to those of adjacent buildings; existing cornice lines should be continued; storefronts should be aligned; and windows, storefronts and other openings should be in the same proportions as those of adjacent buildings both on upper and ground floor levels.

c. Design facades for new buildings should build on the qualities of existing facades with predominant attention given to the design integrity of the vertical wall.

d. Designs which incorporate artificial or synthetic decorative detail to replicate historic precedent are discouraged, while designs which utilize traditional materials and craftsmanship to create the same quality and detail that is fundamental to the historic buildings of the district are encouraged.

e. In new development or redevelopment building materials should be limited to those predominant materials used in the existing structures within the particular subdistrict as defined in PTMC 17.30.040. Synthetic or artificial materials are discouraged in exterior applications.

5. New Additions to Existing Buildings.

a. New additions to existing buildings should be designed first to fit the context of the existing building to which they are attached and secondly into the block within which they are built.

b. New additions to existing buildings should be good “background” additions, which respect and support the existing structure, rather than an “image” addition, which would depart significantly in architectural style.

c. New additions to existing buildings should preserve significant historic materials and features by avoiding construction on a primary or other character-defining elevation. The loss of historic material comprising external walls, internal partitions and floor plans should be minimized.

d. New additions to historic buildings should be compatible with the size, scale, massing and proportion of the historic building to ensure that the historic form is not expanded or changed to an unacceptable degree. Where possible, new additions should be placed on an inconspicuous side or rear elevation so that the new work does not result in a radical change to the form and character of the historic building. New additions, including additional stories, should be set back from the wall plane or roof line to preserve the historic building’s form and to allow the new work to be distinguished from the existing.

e. New additions to historic buildings should be designed in a manner that provides some differentiation in material, color, and detailing so that the new work does not appear to be part of the historic building. The character of the historic resource should be identifiable after the addition is constructed.

B. Specific Subdistrict Standards.

1. Ferry Retail Subdistrict.

a. New development should acknowledge and continue the continuity of the street facade and the predominance of ground level street-front retail bays along Water Street and enclose or otherwise conceal parking facilities.

b. Street landscaping shall be similar to existing landscaping on other areas of Water Street, including the planting of trees. Landscaping shall be used along the waterfront to screen utility structures, such as dumpsters, oil tanks, and service entrances, from public view.

c. Towers of no larger than 100 square feet in plan may exceed the building height limit by a maximum of 10 feet; provided, that no building shall exceed a total of 50 feet.

d. Brick and sheathing materials used in all new construction shall be compatible in color, texture and size with materials used in existing structures within the adjacent areas of the historic overlay district.

e. Building color, signage, lighting and landscaping shall be compatible with, and similar to, those of existing structures within adjacent areas of the historic overlay district.

f. Designs should encourage and facilitate public access on the water-side of the ferry retail district.

g. New development shall provide a similar block pattern as found in the adjacent areas of the historic overlay district. Buildings should be built to the property line along the following view corridors: Water Street; Polk Street; Fillmore Street; Harrison Street; and Van Buren Street. Elements occurring in public rights-of-way, such as signs, fountains and monuments, shall be low in form with vertical elements limited to slender obelisks.

2. Historic Commercial District.

a. Designs which provide water access, walkways and other water-side improvements are encouraged.

b. Designs should preserve and restore public art and historic signage and art on existing buildings.

c. Towers of up to 100 square feet in plan may exceed the height limit by 10 feet, excluding finials or other architectural features of not more than five feet; provided, that no building shall exceed a total of 50 feet.

3. Civic District.

a. Streetscape design shall comply with the Streetscape Design/Main Street Project Manual adopted January 17, 1989, by Ordinance 2143, including any amendments.

b. Brick that is compatible in color, texture and size with brick used in existing structures in this subdistrict should be the dominant building material used in any future construction.

c. Designs should protect the view corridors along the Water Street axis to Point Hudson and the Madison Street axis from Memorial Field to the City Dock through compliance with the height restrictions set forth in Chapter 17.28 PTMC. Buildings framing these view corridors are encouraged to be built to the street property lines. Elements occurring in public rights-of-way, such as signs, fountains and monuments, should be low in form with vertical elements limited to slender obelisks.

d. City Hall should remain the dominant feature of the cityscape in this subdistrict. No building shall be erected in this subdistrict that is greater in height than City Hall. Buildings adjacent to or adjoining City Hall shall be of lower height and building facades shall be designed with less detail and ornamentation than City Hall to defer to the architectural significance of City Hall. Buildings connected to City Hall shall not directly abut City Hall at the street property line, but shall be set back at least five feet from the property line for a length of at least five feet.

4. Point Hudson Marina District.

a. New development or redevelopment should be compatible in style, height, size, proportions and material used with the former Coast Guard and shipyard buildings in this subdistrict. However, new developments are also encouraged to provide a transition to the civic district and the historic commercial district by incorporating features of those subdistricts, such as building materials and construction styles, in the design.

b. Buildings more than 30 feet in length or width shall be designed to give the appearance of groups of small buildings by varying building height, massing, setbacks, and facade features, such as windows and doors, every 30 feet along the length of the building.

c. Towers of up to 100 square feet may exceed the height limit by 10 feet; provided, that no building shall exceed a total of 50 feet.

d. Public access to and along the shoreline is encouraged in all new development in this subdistrict.

e. Mixed use projects incorporating both water-dependent and water-related uses as those terms are defined in the plan are strongly encouraged.

f. New parking facilities and additional roads should be minimized. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004).


17.30.155 Uptown commercial subdistrict – Additional design standards.

In its review of development or municipal improvements occurring within the uptown commercial subdistrict of the historic overlay district, the HPC and the director shall apply the following design standards in addition to those set forth in PTMC 17.30.140.

A. Uptown Form.

1. New development in the uptown commercial subdistrict should assist in promoting the city’s objectives to encourage economically viable multistory development, to foster additional housing in uptown, and to minimize negative impacts of commercial development on adjacent single-family residences.

2. New development or redevelopment shall follow and enhance the unique character of uptown through compliance with the design standards set forth for the uptown commercial subdistrict. Redevelopment and/or additions to existing buildings shall follow these guidelines, and the Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings” (1997), including all amendments.

3. New development or redevelopment must demonstrate that the proposal reflects the uptown C-III district’s general historic character that is typified by neighborhood-oriented, vernacular, utilitarian architecture.

4. Projects should be compatible with the scale of development of the surrounding buildings and should be sited and designed to provide a sensitive transition to nearby, less intensive zones. Projects on zone edges should be developed in a manner that creates a step in perceived height, bulk, and scale between the subject site and the development potential of the adjacent zones.

5. New development should recognize the city’s historic architectural heritage through the use of building materials, construction methods, building proportions and architectural devices compatible with those used in existing buildings, but should not attempt to replicate existing historical buildings. While the intent is not to produce historic replicas or a false sense of historicism, new buildings also should not include forms or features that dramatically conflict with surrounding buildings. In general, new buildings should reflect the following guidance:

a. Avoid unique, attention seeking elements such as complex geometries, large non-rectangular windows, fully glazed facades, etc. Buildings in uptown are generally “background buildings” in that they are not ostentatious in themselves but together create a pleasant composition along the street. New buildings should enhance that composition rather than disrupt it.

b. Details and elements that are found in the district such as modest cornice articulation, simple window groupings, multi-paned windows and standard wood millwork are encouraged where appropriate.

c. A mix of contemporary and traditional materials and details for small elements such as signs, doors, lights, etc., may be appropriate.

d. Although the traditional building configuration is the building facade facing directly on the street front with building modules reflecting a 55-foot property width, other configurations, such as small courtyards and gardens, recessed entries, notched or recessed building facades with small pedestrian open spaces, are also present and may be appropriate for new buildings.

e. Roof decks, roof gardens, and balconies may be appropriate and have the advantage of increasing human activity and “eyes on the street” for security.

6. Buildings with a public use or prominent community activity may deviate from the principles of subsections (A)(5)(a) through (e) of this section, to add variety and local landmark qualities. It is recognized that the uptown district will evolve over time.

7. In the development of streets and parking areas, functional requirements for vehicular movement and parking should not compromise the safety of or inhibit the movement of pedestrians. Pedestrian movement should be enhanced through the location of landscaping, lighting and signage.

B. Height, Bulk and Scale Compatibility.

1. Buildings shall be designed to ensure that building massing, height and scale provide sensitive transition to adjoining residential neighborhoods.

2. New commercial development in the uptown commercial subdistrict should minimize negative impacts of the height and bulk of tall buildings on adjacent single-family residences, including impacts of shade, shadow and loss of privacy.

C. Architectural Design, Elements and Materials.

1. New development should locate windows, skylights, open spaces and decks to take advantage of southern exposure. Buildings and canopies should be designed to utilize natural light and to reduce energy costs.

2. Building elements shall be included as part of building facade to “break up” the facade, not necessarily in a repetitive pattern, to reduce the perceived scale of larger buildings. “Building elements” shall consist of larger building pieces that affect the shape of the building envelope, and include balconies, porches, turrets, bay windows, entrances, overhangs, dormers, inset entrances, etc. “Building elements” are not the same as “building details” such as brackets, decorative elements, and wall lighting, etc.

3. All buildings should be designed to have a clear top, middle, and base. Blank walls are not allowed on front facades facing Lawrence Street.

4. The primary entrances of buildings shall be identified and highlighted through architectural details, lighting, and signage. The design of buildings shall enhance the relationship between buildings and streets by creating easily identifiable building entrances.

D. Transparency.

1. Buildings on Lawrence Street shall provide generous amounts of windows to create ground floors with a transparent quality in order to provide visual interest.

2. Windows shall cover at least 50 percent of the facade area (as measured from grade to eight feet above grade) facing the primary street and also the secondary street on corner lots. The standard shall be applied to each individual street facade. Windows are also encouraged on upper floors.

3. Windows shall not consist of reflective glass.

4. Windows should begin at least 12 inches above grade rather than continue down to grade level (or otherwise as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act).

5. The city may permit building facades with less transparency, provided the project features an exceptionally attractive pedestrian element, such as a special entry with plaza, marquee, or other element approved by the city.

E. Protection from Elements.

1. Buildings on Lawrence Street should provide weather protection at least five feet wide along at least 75 percent of the building’s front facade along Lawrence Street.

2. Wider weather protection features are encouraged to provide for outdoor seating areas.

3. The weather protection may be in the form of awnings, marquees, canopies, or building overhangs. Gaps in the covering are allowed to provide for visual variety in the facade through the use of architectural features and/or landscaping components.

F. Mechanical Equipment, Service Areas and Parking.

1. Mechanical equipment, loading areas, trash, and recycling containers shall be located and/or screened to minimize their visibility from residential neighbors and the public view from adjacent rights-of-way.

2. Refuse and storage containers shall be screened with built and/or landscaped confinements.

3. Refuse and storage areas should be located to the rear or side of the property and away from adjacent streets and residential property.

4. Service and loading areas should be located to the rear or sides of buildings away from adjacent streets, but shall be designed for convenient use.

5. Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be concealed from view by a roof form integrated with the overall architecture of the building, either by locating the equipment within the structure or concealing it from ground level view behind a parapet.

6. Views of rooftop equipment from nearby hillsides shall be minimized.

7. Noise producing mechanical equipment such as fans, heat pumps, etc., should be located and/or shielded so that noise reaching the adjacent properties and the public right-of-way is minimized. The applicant must demonstrate that this standard is achieved by providing equipment specifications and/or calculations of noise impacts.

8. Parking access from Lawrence Street is not allowed if there is another alternative.

9. All parking lots immediately adjacent to residential properties shall be screened from view with a sight obscuring combination of fence, wall and/or landscaping. The city may consider alternate means of screening, provided they meet the intent of providing a full visual screen. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009).


17.30.158 Historic residential development – Additional design standards.

In its review of residential development designated or eligible to be designated on the Port Townsend list of historic places occurring within the historic overlay district, the HPC and the director shall apply the following design standards in addition to those set forth in PTMC 17.30.140.

The standards shall only apply to the work or alteration for which a permit is sought, and shall not be applied to require an owner to change or restore other existing conditions or improvements to meet these standards.

A. General Standards.

1. Principal Facades. The principal historic facade(s) of residential development shall be preserved. A principal facade shall be defined as a facade that fronts on any adjacent public right-of-way (not including alleys). Minor alterations that do not adversely affect the integrity of the principal facade may be permitted; provided, that the proponent can demonstrate that the minor alteration is necessary to accommodate the continued viable use of the residence. Examples of allowable minor alterations include: accommodations to meet life/safety requirements, the use of new materials when historic materials are no longer available, are structurally impractical and/or are energy inefficient; provided, that the new materials match the historic use closely. Functional adaptation of identified principal historic facades may be permitted; provided, that the adaptation is the minimum and least obtrusive necessary and still meets the Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings” (1995), including any amendments, to accommodate continued use.

2. New Additions. To preserve the character and integrity of principal historic facades, any proposed additions to a historic residence shall be located to the rear or side of the subject property consistent with the following requirements:

a. Proposed side additions shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from the building line of the principal historic facade(s).

b. In the case of historic residences that are located on corner lots that have two principal historic facades, additions shall only be permitted on the side containing a nonprincipal historic facade.

c. Additions that expand the residence by increasing the vertical height of the structure shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from the building line of the principal historic facade(s).

d. Additions shall be harmonious with the design of the historic residence, shall clearly be of their own period and shall not be imitative of the original historic design.

e. Proposed additions shall be subordinate design elements that are supportive of the integrity of the original historic residence.

3. Accessory Structures. Accessory structures such as garages, ADUs or other similar structures shall be located to the rear or side of the subject property consistent with the following requirements:

a. Proposed accessory structures shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from the building line of the principal historic facade(s).

b. In the case of historic residences that are located on corner lots that have two principal historic facades, accessory structures shall be permitted on the side containing a principal historic facade; provided, that their proposed location minimizes view blockage of the historic facade from the adjacent public right-of-way.

B. Specific Standards – Pivotal Residences. In its review of residential development of residences designated or eligible to be designated as pivotal under this chapter, the HPC and the director shall apply the following design standards in addition to those set forth in PTMC 17.30.140 and subsection A of this section:

1. Exterior additions or modifications to pivotal structures shall be designed in a manner that maintains and does not destroy the preexisting elements that characterize the building’s historic integrity.

2. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

3. The present height of the existing structure shall remain intact. Any additions or modifications would not exceed the roof line of the original structure.

4. Compatible materials that respect the visual appearance of the existing structure shall be used.

5. Patterns and orientation of door and window openings represented in the existing structure shall be respected.

6. Additions and new construction shall be located to conceal them to the extent possible from the street level view from the adjacent right-of-way. For corner lots, the additions and new construction shall be located to make them as unobtrusive as possible from the view from the adjacent rights-of-way, and preserve to the maximum extent possible the principal facades.

7. The present roof pitches of the existing structure shall be maintained where such element is visible from the adjacent right-of-way.

8. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

9. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

C. Specific Standards – Primary Residences. In its review of residential development of residences designated or eligible to be designated as primary under this chapter, the HPC and the director shall apply the following design standards in addition to those set forth in PTMC 17.30.140 and in subsection A of this section:

1. Exterior additions or modifications to a primary structure shall be designed in a manner that maintains the preexisting characteristics that contribute to the building’s historic integrity. These characteristics include the massing, scale, height and architectural features of the structure.

2. Exterior additions or modifications may be permitted to the side or rear of the building; provided, that the scale and architectural details of the principal facades are preserved.

3. Additions to primary structures shall be designed in a manner that is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and shall be secondary and supportive elements to the preexisting structure.

4. Additions and new construction shall be located to make them as unobtrusive as possible from the view from adjacent rights-of-way.

D. Specific Standards – Secondary Residences. In its review of residential development of residences designated or eligible to be designated as secondary under this chapter, the director shall apply the following design standards in addition to those set forth in PTMC 17.30.140 and subsection A of this section:

1. Restoration activities that remove materials (siding, roofing, etc.) and/or features (doors, windows, etc.) that are inappropriate to the historic period in which the subject property was built are strongly encouraged. Replacement materials and/or features shall closely approximate appropriate historic design but are not required to be exact reproductions of those found on the residence at the time of initial construction. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.30.159 Historic residential departures.

A. Departure – Intent. An “historic residential departure” is a request by the owner of a contributing historic home for relief from a particular design guideline “objective” or dimensional requirement through the use of an alternative technique or standard not otherwise permitted by a strict interpretation of the code. Departures allow expansions/renovations of historic homes to better fit into their immediate site or neighborhood context without a significant loss of architectural integrity or neighborhood character.

B. Departures – Allowed in Limited Situations. Departures from PTMC 17.30.158, Historic residential development – Additional design standards, and the requirements of Table 17.16.030, Residential Zoning Districts – Bulk, Dimensional and Density Requirements, may be permitted for historic residential development as part of the design review process. Through the design review process established by this chapter, departures may be allowed from the following design guidelines and/or bulk and dimensional standards:

1. Location of proposed additions;

2. Location of proposed accessory structures;

3. Building setbacks;

4. Modulation requirements;

5. Lot coverage requirements;

6. Daylight plane requirements.

C. Departure Approval Criteria. In order for a departure from a design guideline or development standard to be allowed, an applicant must demonstrate that the proposal is consistent with the criteria in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section:

1. The proposed departure does not significantly detract from the historic character and nature of the historic residential property for which it is proposed;

2. The proposed departure is consistent with the existing land use pattern with regard to the standard being varied;

3. The proposed departure does not interfere with or negatively impact existing and permitted uses within the zoning district it occupies;

4. The proposed departure does not constitute a threat to the public health, safety and general welfare within the city;

5. The proposed departure is minor in nature and would not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located.

D. Departure Notice and Approval Process.

1. The following departure requests are processed as Type I-A actions (administrative without notice; administrative appeal by applicant only) established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC:

a. Location of proposed additions;

b. Location of proposed accessory structures;

c. Modulation requirements.

2. The following departure requests shall be processed as Type II actions (administrative approval, with mailed and posted notice; appeal by applicant or party of record to the hearing examiner), and notice shall conform to the requirements of PTMC 20.01.150:

a. Building setbacks;

b. Lot coverage requirements;

c. Daylight plane requirements.

E. Outcome of Review. The certificate of review shall include any decision on a departure request, including any conditions.

1. Pivotal and Primary Residences. For pivotal and primary residences:

a. A completed review form or checklist will comprise the recommendation from HPC to the DSD director including whether the approval criteria for a departure have been met.

b. The director shall not act upon the recommendation of the HPC for a period of seven days. During this seven-day period, interested citizens or aggrieved parties may request in writing a “reconsideration” of the HPC recommendation. Such reconsideration requests shall be made in writing, shall state the reasons why a reconsideration request is made, and the relief sought. Upon review of the HPC’s recommendation, and after reviewing any requests for reconsideration, the director may:

i. Issue the certificate of review, including any modifications, conditions, or denial of approval; or

ii. Return the project to the HPC with directions for additional review.

c. To be approved, the director shall deliberate upon HPC’s findings, conclusions, and recommendations, according substantial deference and great weight to the same.

2. Secondary Residences. For secondary residences, the director shall review the departure request and determine if the approval criteria for a departure have been met, and issue the certificate of review, including any modifications, conditions, or denial of approval. Nothing prevents the director from requesting HPC recommendation on the request. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

(Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.30.245 Map and landmark district residential property survey adopted – Effect.

A. The city council adopts the map identified as Historic Residential Inventory (the “2010 map” dated July 12, 2010), which was prepared based on the “Historic Residential Property Inventory Methodology and Scoring System” (“2010 inventory”). The 2010 inventory, and the methodology used in the inventory and reflected on the 2010 map, is adopted by reference. The 2010 inventory is located in the Port Townsend Historic Preservation Guidelines Manual.

B. The map (the “2010 map”) updates the map prepared in the early 1970s (the “1970s map”) showing historic residences in the national historic landmark district (NHLD). When the NHLD was approved in the early 1970s by the National Park Service, it was done with reference to an inventory of historic buildings as shown on the 1970s map. The 1970s map remains in effect, except to the extent it is updated by the 2010 map.

C. Residences and structures that receive a classification of pivotal, primary, or secondary as shown on the 2010 map are considered historic.

D. Residences and structures that are considered historic as shown on the 2010 map are subject to the regulations in Chapter 17.30 PTMC, including all amendments.

E. The 2010 map and the Historic Residential Property Inventory Methodology and Scoring System (“2010 inventory”), or copies, and all revisions thereto shall be maintained in the city clerk’s office and the development services department (DSD) and shall be available for use and examination by the public, and shall be made available for purchase at the DSD. (Ord. 3036 § 1, 2010).

A. The following structures are deemed historic structures and are included or deemed eligible for designation and inclusion on the Port Townsend register:

1. Structures listed pursuant to Chapter 2.72 PTMC.

2. Structures located other than in residential zoning districts identified as pivotal, primary, secondary or altered historic on the map which accompanied the certification of the Port Townsend historic district on May 17, 1976, are prima facie historic structures and deemed eligible for designation and inclusion on the Port Townsend register.

3. Structures identified as contributing (pivotal, primary or secondary) on the map adopted by PTMC 17.30.245, and identified as “Historic Residential Inventory (July 12, 2010),” incorporated by reference.

4. Structures which meet the criteria for determining designation on the Port Townsend register of historic places, pursuant to subsection B of this section.

5. Structures listed or eligible for listing on the local, state or national register of historic places.

B. The criteria for determining designation on the Port Townsend register of historic places are set forth in the Historic Preservation Designation Manual, as it now exists or is later amended. The Historic Preservation Designation Manual is hereby adopted, and incorporated by reference herein.

Copies of the Historic Preservation Designation Manual and Historic Residential Inventory (July 12, 2010), and all revisions thereto, shall be maintained in the city clerk’s office and the development services department (DSD) and shall be available for use and examination by the public, and shall be made available for purchase at the DSD.

C. Structures that may have been inaccurately designated or for which the designation may have changed since previous designation, or the map which accompanied the certification of the Port Townsend historic district on May 17, 1976, was prepared, or the Historic Residential Inventory was prepared, or on the map adopted by PTMC 17.30.245, may request a confirmation of the current designation by the director. Requests for confirmation of current historic designation shall be submitted and reviewed consistent with the requirements and process of this chapter for designation on the Port Townsend register.

D. Removal of Structure from the Register. In the event that any structure no longer meets the criteria for designation to the Port Townsend register of historic places, or the structure was inaccurately designated, or the designation of the property or structure has changed since previous designation, or changed since the map which accompanied the certification of the Port Townsend historic district on May 17, 1976, was prepared, or changed since the Historic Residential Inventory was prepared, the HPC or property owner may initiate removal of such designation by the same procedure as provided for in this chapter establishing the designation.

E. Effects of Listing on the Register.

1. Listing on the Port Townsend register of historic places is an honorary designation denoting significant association with the historic, archaeological, engineering, or cultural heritage of the community; and

2. Design review by HPC of local register properties shall be limited to the scope established in this chapter.

F. Maintenance of the Local Register. The list of properties on the local register of historic places shall be maintained by DSD.

G. Eligible Property for Special Tax Valuation. For the purposes of historic property tax valuation authorized as a duty of the committee under PTMC 2.72.060(A), the class of eligible property is:

1. Property within the city’s C-III zoning district; and

2. Property listed on the local register of historic places. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.30.260 Termination of proceedings.

In any case where a structure is nominated for designation and thereafter the director determines to approve or not to approve such nomination, or where a proceeding to remove a property or structure has led to a decision to remove or not remove the property or structure from the Port Townsend register of historic places, such proceeding shall terminate and no new proceeding under this chapter may be commenced with respect to such property or structure (even if ownership has changed) within five years from the date of such termination, provided, if such proceeding results in a determination that a structure is not eligible for designation, proceedings to designate the property may occur within five years with the written agreement of the owner. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.30.270 Exemption from permit timelines.

Pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140, the city excludes the entire designation process for nomination, including any review of the director’s decision by the hearing examiner, from the time limits and the other provisions of RCW 36.70B.060 through 36.70B.080 and the provisions of RCW 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.30.280 Requirement of certificate of approval.

After the filing of a nomination with the director and thereafter as long as proceedings for a designation are pending, a certificate of approval must be obtained before the owner may make alterations or significant changes to specific features or characteristics of the structure which are identified in the nomination. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

The purpose of this article is to regulate demolition and provide for the retention of historic structures that reflect the city’s architectural, artistic, aesthetic, historical, economic and social heritage. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.30.310 Definitions.

A. Definition – Demolition.

1. “Demolition (or partial demolition)” means the destruction or removal, or relocation, of a building or structure, in whole or in part.

2. Demolition (or partial demolition) pertains to the demolition of significant features of a building that are important to defining the building’s or structure’s historic character.

3. Demolition (or partial demolition) does not include the removal of past additions for the express purpose of restoration of a structure to its historic appearance, form, or function.

Demolition (or partial demolition) does not include the destruction or removal of portions of a building or structure that are not significant to defining its historic character, or that is allowed pursuant to design review application approved pursuant to PTMC 17.30.080. This exclusion is valid so long as the demolition is done as part of a design review application approved pursuant to PTMC 17.30.080. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010. Formerly 17.30.085(A)).


17.30.320 Certificates of approval – Demolition.

A. General Requirements. Prior to the partial or complete demolition (as defined in PTMC 17.30.310) of a building or structure regulated under this chapter, the applicant must obtain a certificate of approval for the proposed demolition.

B. Exemption – City Abatement of Unsafe Conditions. In the event of a finding by the city building official of an unsafe condition, the building official may issue an abatement order allowing partial or complete demolition (as defined in PTMC 17.30.310) of a structure otherwise regulated under this chapter; provided, that all reasonable efforts have first been made to preserve and correct unsafe conditions rather than to partially or completely demolish valuable buildings or structures.

C. SEPA Authority. In addition to the requirements of this article, the city retains substantive authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW) to review, condition or deny any proposed demolition based upon the identification of probable, significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposal. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3013 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2859 § 4, 2004. Formerly 17.30.060).


17.30.330 Preapplication conference mandatory.

All applications for a certificate of approval under this chapter that involve demolition or partial demolition shall not be accepted by the director unless the project proponent has scheduled and attended a preapplication conference with development services department staff and a representative of the HPC. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to acquaint the project proponent with the requirements of this chapter and to provide preliminary comments on the acceptability of the proposal. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.30.340 Application.

Unless waived by the director, applicants proposing the demolition of any building or structure regulated under this chapter shall supply the information required under PTMC 17.30.080 and the information set forth in this article. The information to be provided relates only to the property or building under review. The information to be provided does not require information concerning an owner’s assets or income, except as it specifically relates to the property or building under review.

A. Where demolition of the building is sought due to unsafe conditions, the applicant shall supply a report from a Washington-licensed structural engineer that substantiates that the building thereof is imminently dangerous to the public.

B. Where demolition of the building is sought for reasons other than unsafe conditions, the applicant shall supply a report from a Washington-licensed structural engineer and a financial analyst or economist with demonstrated competence in the field, demonstrating that maintenance of the building or structure or any important features thereof proposed for demolition will impose an economic hardship upon the owner, rendering it impracticable to renovate, restore or reuse the structure, and rendering it economically infeasible to renovate, restore, or reuse the structure in comparison to the economic value of the proposed redevelopment. The report shall analyze the reasonable economic alternatives to demolition, including redevelopment for uses permitted by city code, and an analysis showing whether the redeveloped property is capable of providing a reasonable economic return upon completion of reasonable renovation or repair activities. The report shall also contain the following information:

1. Current level of economic return including the amount paid for the property, date of purchase, party from whom purchased and the relationship between the current owner of record, the applicant and the person from whom the property was purchased;

2. Annual gross income from the property for the previous three years, itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous three years, and depreciation deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period;

3. Remaining balance on the mortgage or other financing secured by the property, real estate taxes paid on the property for the previous four years, and the most recent assessed value of the property;

4. All appraisals obtained within the previous three years by the owner in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of the property;

5. Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked for and offers received, if any, within the previous two years;

6. Fair market value of the property at the time of application;

7. Whether the remainder of the site is capable of economically viable development even if the structure is required to remain on the site.

C. Scaled architectural renderings, drawings and plans of sufficient detail showing the replacement buildings or structure proposed to be built on the site upon completion of demolition work. “Sufficient detail” means detail to allow conceptual review. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010. Formerly 17.30.085(B)).


17.30.350 Waiver – Advance determination.

The director, following recommendation of HPC, may waive the requirements in this article pertaining to demolition, in advance and in writing of any demolition, if the structure is not designated or eligible for designation and inclusion on the Port Townsend register.

An applicant seeking demolition shall be entitled to a determination whether the proposal is entitled to a waiver without having to submit drawings or plans of the proposed replacement or remodeled structure. In addition, an applicant may seek a determination whether a demolition constitutes a significant alteration of a structure, for purposes of determining if the demolition standards of this chapter apply. In these situations, the applicant shall submit such information as determined by the DSD director is necessary to review a proposed demolition. A decision by the city on this application shall be effective for a period of five years from the date of the city’s decision and, if an application for a certificate of approval is filed within five years, such additional amounts of time as are necessary to process the application. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010. Formerly 17.30.085(C)).


17.30.360 Applications for demolition.

Applications for demolition, where no waiver as determined by the DSD director applies, shall be processed as follows:

A. HPC shall provide recommendation on whether the demolition meets applicable criteria and (as applicable) a recommendation on design review for the replacement building or structure. HPC may appoint a subcommittee and delegate to the subcommittee authority to advise and make recommendations to the director with respect to applications involving demolition.

B. The DSD director shall issue a written decision, granting, granting with conditions, or denying the application. The decision shall contain an explanation of the director’s decision.

C. Notice of the director’s decision shall be mailed to any person who, prior to rendering the decision, made a written request to receive notice of the decision or submitted written substantive comments on the application.

D. The time limits set forth in PTMC 17.30.100 apply to this article.

E. The process relating to Type II decisions (administrative decision with appeal to hearing examiner) applies, except as modified by this article. A party of record may appeal the final decision of the independent expert to the hearing examiner in the manner provided by PTMC 17.30.130. A determination that the application is or is not detrimental to the historic character of the district is appealable directly to the hearing examiner, without the applicant having to submit drawings or plans of the proposed replacement or remodeled structure, in the manner provided by PTMC 17.30.130. If the hearing examiner denies the applicant’s appeal, then the process set forth in this article for demolition applies. If the hearing examiner upholds the applicant’s appeal, then the process in this chapter for design review not involving demolition applies.

F. Peer Review. The director may obtain peer review of any documents or reports where the director deems it to be reasonably necessary to ensure the accuracy, effectiveness or objectivity of any of the documents, reports or measures proposed within them. A written determination from the director requiring peer review shall include, as applicable, the following information:

1. A statement giving the reason(s) peer review is necessary (e.g., why the director believes peer review is appropriate to ensure accuracy, errors of fact or law, error in judgment, objectivity, or information or new information);

2. A statement of the specific areas of the report believed to be inadequate or in error, or not sufficiently definite to allow meaningful analysis;

3. The specific information sought (such as confirmation of the structural deficiencies cited by the report, the adequacy of financial estimates given for the renovation, restoration or reuse of the building or structure, feasibility of the proposed replacement structure to actually be built, conflicting evidence, etc.).

Before requiring peer review, the director shall attempt to obtain clarification or new information from the applicant or author of the report addressing issues raised by the director.

The city shall pay for the peer review; however, if the peer review establishes that the reports submitted by the owner were not accurate to a material degree, then the applicant shall pay for the peer review.

G. The director may also consult with other agencies, requesting information on the proposal, and review of any report’s contents which lie within the other agency’s jurisdiction or expertise. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010. Formerly 17.30.085(D), (E)).


17.30.370 Criteria for approval.

A. Except as provided in this section, an application for demolition of a building or structure regulated under this chapter shall be denied unless the application is based on the building being an imminent threat (as defined in subsection C of this section), and/or the structure is so deteriorated, and there is so little historical fabric, that it would be unreasonably costly to retain the historic, cultural, and architectural significance of the structure through rehabilitation or renovation.

B. An application for demolition of a building or structure in a commercial district (other than a building built for residential purposes) shall be allowed if:

1. The denial or partial denial will deprive the owner of reasonable economic use of the property;

2. The building, structure, or portion thereof to be removed cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable economic return;

3. There is no viable or reasonable alternative which would have less impact.

C. “Imminent threat” means the building, structure, or portion thereof to be removed constitutes a documented major and imminent threat or immediate danger to the public’s health and safety, or is likely to partially or totally collapse and thereby injure persons or damage property, and said demolition or removal is the only reasonable way to alleviate said threat.

D. The owner has the burden of proof to establish by clear and convincing evidence the necessary findings.

E. If application of the criteria results in a denial, but the proposed action is necessary to correct an unsafe or dangerous condition on the property, then the director may issue a permit strictly limited to correcting emergency conditions. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010. Formerly 17.30.085(F)).


17.30.380 Certificate of approval for demolition – Conditions.

A. General Standards. A certificate of approval for demolition shall not be granted unless the following criteria have been met:

1. Conditions which provide for the owner to document the property in manner approved by the director and/or for rights of access to the property for the purposes of documentation or for agreed upon removal of materials or artifacts.

2. In addition, the director may impose a stay on issuance of the demolition permit by DSD for a period of up to 90 days to allow alternatives to demolition to be explored. A longer time period may be established, if agreed to by the applicant.

B. Standard Applicable to Demolition of a Building or Structure in a Commercial District (Other Than a Building Built for Residential Purposes). In addition to standards in subsection A of this section, a certificate of approval for demolition of a building or structure in a commercial district (other than a building built for residential purposes) shall not be granted unless the following criteria have been met:

1. The applicant has received conceptual approval for a new replacement structure with a floor area ratio (FAR) that is at least 75 percent of the FAR of the building to be demolished; and

2. The applicant has the financial ability and intent to build the proposed new structure as demonstrated by a guarantee agreement between the owner and the city. The financial arrangement or assurance acceptable to the city shall ensure or provide reasonable assurance the approved replacement structure will be built within three years of approval of the replacement design (provided the director for good cause may grant at any time an additional period of time up to one additional year). Projects subject to the shoreline master program shall comply with applicable time frames in those regulations. Said guarantee agreement must contain a covenant to construct the approved replacement structure, be recorded against the title of the land, and require the applicant to post a performance bond, letter of credit, escrow agreement or other arrangement or evidence acceptable to the city to ensure construction of the approved new structure.

C. Certificate of Approval for Demolition – Expiration. A certificate of approval for partial or complete demolition (as defined in PTMC 17.30.310) expires if the work authorized by the certificate is not commenced within 180 days from the date of issuance of the demolition permit. The director may extend the time for commencement of work upon written request by the applicant showing circumstances beyond his or her control. If the certificate of approval for demolition expires, a new application for such must be submitted and approval obtained before work can be commenced. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010. Formerly 17.30.085(G), (H)).


17.30.390 Appeals.

A. Process. Appeals of a decision of the director to grant, deny, or attach conditions to an application for nomination shall be made in accordance with the appeal provisions set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC for Type II decisions (administrative approval, with appeal by applicant or party of record to the hearing examiner).

B. Standard of Review. In making its decision on the appeal, the hearing examiner shall accord substantial weight to the decision of the director. In the event the hearing examiner denies the appeal and affirms the decision of the director, the hearing examiner shall adopt written findings of fact and conclusions in support of its decision. In order to grant any appeal from the decision of the director, the hearing examiner must find that the decision was clearly erroneous or that the director failed to adhere to the design standards established by this chapter. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article IV. Maintenance – Demolition by Neglect


17.30.400 Maintenance – Demolition by neglect.

A. Purpose.

1. The intent of this section is to prevent the situation where an historic building is intentionally or through neglect allowed to become unsafe or deteriorate to the point that demolition by neglect occurs.

2. The requirements of this section apply to the owner of an historic property and are in addition to any requirements of the building code.

3. It is not the intent of this section to address minor building code or maintenance issues, but is intended to protect against gross violations that threaten the long-term viability of an historic structure.

4. A primary goal of the city is to preserve historic assets while at the same time making every reasonable effort to work with owners of residential properties experiencing demolition by neglect to allow the owners to continue to reside in the residence, so long as the residence is safe and habitable. To this end, the director should allow additional time as necessary and appropriate to the owner to correct defects, and work with the owner in obtaining assistance in making repairs if the owner does not have the resources to make necessary repairs.

5. The director is authorized to allow for interim protective measures that “mothball” or stabilize a structure against demolition by neglect. Such measures should be interim in nature, and should specify time frames for corrective measures that address decay and deterioration from demolition by neglect.

B. All historic structures shall be preserved against such decay and deterioration and shall be free from structural defects through prompt correction of any of the following:

1. Facades which may fall and injure members of the public or property.

2. Deteriorated or inadequate foundation, defective or deteriorated flooring or floor supports, deteriorated walls or other vertical structural supports.

3. Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports or other horizontal members which sag, split or buckle due to defective material or deterioration.

4. Deteriorated or ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations or floors, including broken windows or doors.

5. Defective or insufficient weather protection for exterior wall covering, including lack of paint or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering.

6. Any fault or defect in the building which renders it not properly watertight or structurally unsafe.

C. Demolition by Neglect – Notification – Process. In the event the director determines a structure is experiencing demolition by neglect, the director is authorized to give notice to the owner and/or person in charge of the specific instances of failure to maintain or repair, in accordance with the procedures in Chapter 1.20 PTMC, Code Administration and Enforcement. Except in cases of life-safety or emergency, or in cases where the owner has ignored or failed to comply with past notices, the director shall seek voluntary compliance and provide at least 60 days for voluntary correction to occur or for a plan proposed by the owner with time frames for correction to be approved by the director. (Ord. 3037 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).1

17.31.060 Purpose – M/C mixed light manufacturing and commercial.

A. M/C – Mixed Light Manufacturing and Commercial. This district accommodates a wide range of uses meeting a desired form that creates a walkable urban area where a person can walk or bike to work or to fulfill many shopping needs. The purpose of this district is to provide for a mix of commercial, light manufacturing with on-site retailing, and workforce housing. These are uses which may have mixed uses or combine aspects of both on-site manufacturing and retailing (e.g., specialty crafts or artisans). Manufacturing to commercial floor area ratios are necessary for this district to ensure that certain uses do not dominate at the expense of others. The site areas located within the commercial focus overlay district shall be subject to the provisions in PTMC 17.31.120. (Ord. 3232 § 1 (Exh. B), 2019).


17.31.070 Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses – M/C zoning district.

A. Table 17.31.070 identifies land uses in the M/C mixed light manufacturing and commercial zoning district that are permitted outright (P), subject to a conditional use permit (C), prohibited (X), or not applicable (N/A). However, notwithstanding the fact that a use may be permitted outright, additional permits may be required for certain projects. 

B. Requirements for the uses identified in Table 17.31.070 which are contained within other provisions of this title are referenced under the heading “Specific Use Standards,” although this should not be construed as a comprehensive listing of all provisions of this title which may apply to any given use. Specifically, the provisions of PTMC 17.31.080, Bulk, dimensional and density requirements, PTMC 17.31.150, Bulk, dimensional and lot standards by building type, Chapter 17.72 PTMC, Off-Street Parking and Loading, and Chapter 17.76 PTMC, Signs, shall apply to all uses, even if not noted in Table 17.31.070.

C. Limitations on Use – Buffering Requirements. All sites in the M/C district having a common boundary with residential districts (i.e., R-I, R-II, R-III and R-IV) shall have planted and maintained along such common boundary a view-obscuring greenbelt of shrubs, trees and native vegetation, which will grow to not less than eight feet in height nor less than 10 feet in width within five years, for screening purposes and controlling access.

D. Limitations on Use – General Requirements. Manufacturing uses shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Noise. In the M/C district the construction and operation of facilities and uses shall follow best management practices so as to minimize unnecessary conflicts with and impacts to adjacent nonindustrial land or water uses to the extent practicable given the intended use and zoning. 

2. Light and Glare. Exterior lighting shall not be used in such a manner that produces glare on public streets or roads and neighboring property. Arc welding, acetylene torch cutting or similar processes shall be performed so as not to be seen from any point beyond the outside of the property.

3. Fire and Safety Hazards.

a. The storage and handling of inflammable liquids, liquefied petroleum gases and explosives shall comply with rules and regulations falling under the jurisdiction of the city fire chief, the laws of the state and other local ordinances.

b. Bulk storage of inflammable liquids below ground shall be permitted, and the tank shall be located not closer to the property line than the greatest dimension (diameter, length, or height) of the tank.

4. Interferences. Provisions must be made for necessary shielding or other preventive measures against interferences occasioned by mechanical or electrical equipment, uses or processes with electrical apparatus in nearby buildings or land uses.

5. Waste Products. Liquid and solid wastes, storage of animal or vegetable waste which attract insects or rodents or otherwise create a health hazard shall be prohibited. No waste products shall be exposed to view from eye level from any property line in the M/C district.

E. Incidental uses which are identified in this title as prohibited or conditional uses within the applicable zoning district shall be considered conditional and processed in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC subject to the approval criteria codified in Chapter 17.84 PTMC.

F. Where portions of a site are located within the commercial focus overlay district, the provisions of PTMC 17.31.120, Development standards – Commercial focus overlay, shall apply.

17.31.100 Purpose – Commercial focus overlay.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish a “commercial focus overlay district” wherein permitted commercial uses of the underlying zone are required for ground floors of buildings fronting designated streets within the boundaries of the district. (Ord. 3232 § 1 (Exh. B), 2019).


17.31.110 Boundaries of district – Commercial focus overlay.

The boundaries of the commercial focus overlay district are depicted on the official zoning map. (Ord. 3232 § 1 (Exh. B), 2019).


17.31.120 Development standards – Commercial focus overlay.

The following development standards apply to structures within the commercial focus overlay and are not intended to preclude other provisions of this title which may also apply. Specifically, the provisions of any underlying zoning district, Chapter 17.44 PTMC, Commercial and Mixed Use Architectural Site Design Standards, and Chapter 17.72 PTMC, Off-Street Parking and Loading, shall apply to all uses.

A. Uses Permitted. One or more of the following uses, as permitted in the underlying zone, shall be required to occupy a minimum of 75 percent of any building’s ground floor linear frontage along an arterial or collector roadway within the boundaries of this overlay district:

1. Retail, excepting wholesale retail uses.

2. Service, excepting mini-storage and vehicular service uses.

3. Dwelling, live/work.

B. Building Setback Standards. The following setback standards apply to building portions within the commercial focus overlay district. These setback allowances may supersede setback standards established in the underlying zone and PTMC 17.31.150, Bulk, dimensional and lot standards by building type.

1. No minimum front setbacks are required.

2. The maximum building setback shall be 20 feet. Buildings may be set back further to avoid trees, utilities, easements, and similar features. Buildings may be set back further to allow for an outdoor plaza, courtyard or similar feature. 

C. Minimum Facade Requirements Along Streets. 

1. Arterial and Collector Streets. Buildings/structures shall occupy a minimum of 75 percent of the site frontage along an adjacent arterial or collector roadway within overlay district boundaries. 

2. Local Streets. Buildings/structures shall occupy at least 50 percent of the site frontage along an adjacent local street within overlay district boundaries. 

3. Alleys. These standards do not apply to alleys.

Parking location shall be in accordance with the building-specific standards of the underlying zone, Chapters 17.44 and 17.72 PTMC. (Ord. 3232 § 1 (Exh. B), 2019).


17.31.130 Application of regulations – Commercial focus overlay.

All properties located within the commercial focus overlay district shall be subject to both its underlying zone classification and to the requirements established in the commercial focus overlay district. Where the provisions of the commercial focus overlay district conflict with the provisions of an underlying zone or other provision of this title, the more restrictive limitation shall apply. (Ord. 3232 § 1 (Exh. B), 2019).


17.31.140 Purpose – Building-specific standards.

The general purpose for the building-specific standards is to recognize that various residential building types have specific design and layout characteristics. This chapter is intended to establish specific dimensional standards for single-family attached, townhouse/rowhouse, apartment houses, and/or live/work residential building types. In many cases, the zoning district dimensional standards are not appropriate for residential buildings types; thus, this chapter establishes specific standards for residential building types in certain zoning districts. (Ord. 3232 § 1 (Exh. B), 2019).


17.31.150 Bulk, dimensional and lot standards by building type.

A. The standards herein are unique and applicable to the following residential building types in the mixed use, commercial, and manufacturing zoning districts:

1. Single-family attached;

2. Townhouse/rowhouse;

3. Apartment houses;

4. Live/work.

B. Table 17.31.150 (Building-Specific Standards) establishes the setback, height, and lot dimensional requirements for the residential building types listed in subsection A of this section. The table may also impose other dimensional requirements and design standards. 

C. The dimensional standards listed in Table 17.31.150 (Building-Specific Standards) shall supersede other district requirements. 

D. Where a site and/or development project is located within the commercial focus overlay district, the provisions of PTMC 17.31.120 shall also apply.

17.32.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the goals and policies of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan by promoting creativity in site layout and design, allowing flexibility in the application of the standards for residential, mixed residential/commercial and commercial manufacturing development in order to protect and enhance environmental features, encouraging the development of affordable housing, promoting the city’s economic development strategy, and providing other public benefits. This chapter provides performance criteria to encourage flexibility in the choice of the types of living units available to the public through the planned unit development (PUD) process. More specifically, it is the purpose of this chapter to:

A. Allow development of land with physical constraints, while at the same time preserving the natural characteristics of a site, including topography, native vegetation, wildlife habitat, environmentally sensitive areas, and other natural amenities of value to the community;

B. Create and/or preserve open space for recreation and aesthetic enjoyment of residents and employees;

C. Provide for the management and control of stormwater;

D. Allow developers to use innovative methods and approaches not available under conventional zoning methods to:

1. Facilitate the construction of a variety of housing types and densities serving the diverse housing needs of Port Townsend residents to promote the affordable housing goals and policies of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan,

2. Promote innovative, well designed commercial and light manufacturing developments which are consistent with and supportive of the city’s economic development strategy;

E. Provide for the economic provision of public facilities and services by allowing choices in the layout of streets, utility networks, and other public improvements through superior site design and the use of clustering;

F. Avoid the overburdening of present or planned capacity of public utilities, services, facilities and streets, which may occur under conventional site development and zoning methods; and

G. Encourage infill within areas of the city which are characterized by existing development. (Ord. 3129 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

Planned unit developments are permitted pursuant to the provisions of this section within the following districts: all residential districts (R-I, R-II, R-III and R-IV) and mixed use districts (C-I/MU and C-II/MU); the C-II general commercial district; and the M/C mixed commercial/light manufacturing district; and constitutes a “floating” overlay zone over these districts.

B. Uses Permitted.

1. For planned unit developments that contain multiple underlying zones:

a. A planned unit development may not authorize uses that are inconsistent with those uses allowed by the general category (commercial, residential, manufacturing, mixed use) of the underlying zone, or overlay district designated for each separate parcel within the proposed planned unit development boundary; provided, however, this chapter permits the development of limited multifamily housing R-I and R-II zones, and limited commercial development in purely residential planned unit developments in all residential zones, so long as the requirements of this chapter are satisfied.

b. The location of the uses in planned unit developments may vary from each parcel’s underlying zoning; provided, that the use falls within the general category (commercial, residential, manufacturing, mixed use) of the underlying zone of the parcel.

2. For split zone properties in single ownership, the uses within each of the zoning districts are allowed on the property as long as the use is not inconsistent with the uses allowed by the general category (commercial, residential, manufacturing, mixed use) of the underlying zone.

C. This chapter may be applied to existing subdivisions and lots of record on which no development has yet occurred, or where adequate vacant land exists within an existing development to meet standards and criteria of this chapter.

D. The PUD process provides an alternative to traditional development under prescriptive zoning and subdivision standards. This chapter shall not be applied to single-family residential lots incapable of further subdivision due to lot size or as a means to avoid other procedures more appropriately reviewed as variance applications under Chapter 17.86 PTMC.

E. A PUD application must be processed with either an application for short subdivision, full subdivision, or binding site plan approval. The scope of this chapter is to allow more innovative ways of designing such development applications, enabling applicants to take advantage of incentives, including flexible zoning standards, modification of requirements of the city’s engineering design standards, and bonus densities in appropriate circumstances, in exchange for public benefits. (Ord. 3129 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.030 Minimum lot area.

The minimum lot area required for property proposed for a PUD shall be:

A. R-I and R-II districts: 40,000 square feet;

B. R-III and R-IV districts: 20,000 square feet;

C. C-I/MU and C-II/MU districts: no minimum; and

D. C-II and M/C districts: no minimum. (Ord. 3129 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

The PUD application shall be considered simultaneously with an application for one or more of the following: a preliminary plat or short plat; binding site plan; boundary line adjustment; conditional use permit; multifamily development permit; variance; or any other permitting action. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.060 Innovative residential development.

A. Purpose.

1. More efficient use can be made of land, energy and resources and more livable development can be achieved when the designer has flexibility in residential types, placement and density. Such flexibility can be achieved while safeguarding the public interest by review of the proposed planned unit development plan which shows the type and placement of residential structures. Therefore, the city allows planned residences at varied densities where specified in the appropriate zones of the city.

2. Upon compliance with this chapter, the use of land may comply with the provisions in this section in lieu of the provisions of the zone where located.

3. It is intended that innovative residential developments encourage imaginative design to achieve these purposes. Therefore, incentives and flexibility may be allowed such as clustered housing and bonus densities, lot averaging, zero lot lines, condominium development, and mixed residential types. The city may approve the use of these tools as provided in this section as deemed reasonable and warranted by the excellence of the resulting design and its benefits to the community.

B. Techniques.

1. Clustered Housing. When residences are clustered in design groups in a planned unit development with common open space, the clustered housing may, in lieu of the zone restrictions, be designed with building locations, lot sizes, yards and/or density standards as prescribed on the plat or on plans for the planned unit development approved by the city.

2. Bonus Density. When a plat, planned unit development, or other instrument is submitted under this chapter as an innovative development, and is of sufficient excellence in design and planning, a higher density may be allowed therein in accordance with PTMC 17.32.070.

3. Lot Area Averaging. Lot area may be varied. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, the combined area of all lots and the private common open space in the planned unit development shall be equal to the density or lot size allowed in the zone where located.

4. Flexible Yards. Yards may be reduced to zero provided the structures are shown on the plat or planned unit development and a 10-foot access for maintenance is given by yard and/or easement along each outside wall.

5. Residential Types. To achieve the most efficient use and conservation of land, energy, resources, view and terrain, mixed residential types may be designated and allowed in innovative residential planned unit developments as prescribed in this chapter.

C. Minimum Lot Size. The minimum permissible size for a single residential lot permitted through use of the incentives allowed in this chapter shall be 3,000 square feet.

D. Buyer Notification. The planned unit development plan shall note that the residences thereon constitute an innovative residential development and must be constructed as shown on the planned unit development plan. Building permits may be issued only for structure types and placements as shown on the planned unit development plan. Sales agreements and titles for land and residences sold in innovative residential developments shall note this restriction. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.070 Modification of permitted densities – Bonus density.

A. Purpose for Bonus Densities. Bonus densities are intended to provide the incentive to encourage the development of affordable housing, provide additional public amenities, or preserve valuable natural or cultural resources and features. The satisfaction of any of the bonus density criteria specified in subsection D of this section is considered to be in the public interest and worthy of a bonus density.

B. Eligibility for Bonus Densities. Eligibility to obtain a bonus density is based upon site plan review and approval by the city after a public hearing. Such bonus densities may be granted to a deserving application if the PUD plan submitted is judged by the city to have achieved one or more of the bonus density criteria. 

C. Maximum Bonus Density. The maximum bonus density allowed is limited to an additional 20 percent over the density allowed in the underlying zone. In zones where a bonus density may be allowed, either the bonus density allowance in these PUD provisions or that allowed in the zone may be utilized in the PUD, but not both. In instances where calculation of the 20 percent bonus density would result in a fractional dwelling unit, any fraction less than one-half shall be disregarded and fractions of one-half or greater shall allow one additional dwelling unit to be considered. Based upon attributes of a proposal and the characteristics of the development site, the city may determine that a bonus density of less than 20 percent is appropriate. In addition to criteria provided in this section, the density shall be compatible with the site’s natural constraints and the character and density of the surrounding area. Compatibility for bonus density shall also be determined by proximity of the site to arterials, transit service, employment and shopping areas and planned amenities.

D. Basis for Approval of Bonus Density. Upon submittal of the PUD application, the director shall review the proposed project and submit a report to the hearing examiner, containing recommendations and proposed findings of fact and conclusions with respect to the allocation of bonus densities for the project. The allocation of bonus densities should be based upon a comprehensive review of the entire project. It is the intention of this section to allow bonus densities where a PUD applicant proposes design attributes providing public benefits in addition to those required by local, state or federal land use or environmental regulations. Bonus densities will not be allowed for site design proposals which merely reflect mandatory requirements of local, state and federal codes or regulations. Consideration of the following criteria should be given, but need not be limited to these:

1. Preservation of Agricultural Land and Open Space and Natural, Historical and Cultural Features (Exceeding Mandatory Code Requirements). Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include the quality of agricultural soils; preservation and minimum disturbance of natural features and wildlife habitat; preservation of unique historical or cultural features; preservation of open space; dedication to the city of land within the city’s potential park or open space areas and corridor as designated in the comprehensive plan and as shown on the land use map; and preservation of air, sunlight and scenic resources.

2. Public Service and Facility Availability (Exceeding Mandatory Code Requirements). Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include the provision of public schools; public park or other public facilities and/or sites; bicycle and pedestrian pathway systems; public transit and arterial access to the site; and special site design for special needs residents to situate or cluster uses within a reasonable distance of fire and police protection, medical, shopping, church and other such amenities.

3. Energy Efficiency (Exceeding Mandatory Code Requirements). Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include preservation of solar access; south orientation with added glazing for inhabited structures; the use of landscaping and topography for windbreaks and shading; common wall construction; transportation management strategies, including transportation demand management (“TDM”) strategies; the use of solar energy systems either passive or active for heating and/or cooling; energy conserving design of roadways and other structures; and higher insulation levels.

4. Public Recreation Facilities (Exceeding Mandatory Code Requirements). Items for consideration in meeting this criterion may include provision for public recreational features such as tennis courts, active play areas, swimming pools, passive open space areas, bicycle and pedestrian pathway systems.

5. Environmental Design (Exceeding Mandatory Code Requirements). Items for consideration in this section may include on-site designs providing regional benefits, including drainage control using natural drainage and landscaped drainage retention facilities; flood control measures, particularly those measures serving regional needs; significant public access provided to designated potential open space or park areas, shoreline areas, trails, scenic sites and viewpoints; provision for substantial and exceptional landscape treatment; and the use of recycled materials and resource conserving designs.

6. Affordable Housing (Exceeding Mandatory Code Requirements). Items for consideration include the provision of a mix of housing types, utilization of townhouses, condominiums and apartments directed to providing a reasonable mix or diversity of bona fide affordable housing opportunities for a diverse segment of the community. Bonus densities will also be allowed for projects providing low-income housing in market rate developments. In such developments and other developments seeking bonus densities for the provision of low-income housing opportunities, the amount of bonus will be linked to the level of affordability, i.e., the lower the cost or rental rate per unit, the greater the bonus afforded to the development. Density bonuses for low-income housing projects will be granted only where all of the following conditions are satisfied:

a. The developer must agree to sell or rent the units to qualifying residents (i.e., only low-income and very low-income households);

b. The developer must ensure the continued affordability of the units by qualified residents for a minimum of 40 years through the use of restrictive covenants or other deed restrictions approved by the city; and

c. The units must be of an innovative design and compatible with existing neighborhood character, with adequate assurances that such design and compatibility will be maintained throughout the 40-year period.

7. Provision of Innovative Design. Items for consideration include the provision of innovative design in a PUD similar, but not limited, to that described in PTMC 17.32.060(B). PTMC and innovative design which provides compact, attractive urban development in areas of the city identified through the comprehensive plan for infill development.

8. Other suitable items believed by the city to be worthy of consideration may also be included as bonus density criteria. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-6 § 4), 2010; Ord. 2982 § 5, 2008; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.080 Modification of permitted uses – Commercial uses.

A. A planned unit development may allow commercial uses in residential zones which are not otherwise permitted in the underlying use zone only under the following circumstances:

1. The use shall be part of a planned development in which not more than 10 percent of the gross floor area of the development is devoted to a commercial use which is not otherwise permitted in the underlying use zone;

2. The use shall be supportive of and/or complementary to the other uses within a planned development and scaled to meet primarily the needs of the inhabitants of the project;

3. The use shall be compatible with the uses permitted on other properties in the surrounding area; and

4. There is public benefit to be realized by allowing the proposed use.

B. Basis for Approval of Commercial Uses in Residential PUDs. Commercial uses may be located within the planned unit development when the proposed development includes residential use as an integral component of the planned development and when commercial uses are situated and developed in such a manner as to be compatible with any residential uses that are existing or which could be developed in the adjoining residentially zoned area. 

C. In proposing a commercial use in a residential zone, the applicant shall establish specific community economic need for the use and facilities. The DSD director may require a competent market analysis to demonstrate that need.

D. Building permits for commercial uses in a residential PUD situated within R-I, R-II, R-III and R-IV districts may not be issued until at least two-thirds of the proposed residential units are completed, including issuance of final certificates of occupancy. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.090 Modification of development standards.

A. The following development standards may be modified in approving a PUD application:

1. Building setbacks (excepting side yard setbacks and other setbacks adjacent to or abutting residentially zoned properties);

2. Height of building or structure in C-I/MU and C-II/MU zones, not to exceed 40 feet in the C-I/MU zone and 50 feet in the C-II/MU, C-II and M/C zones;

3. Required off-street parking spaces;

4. Landscaping requirements;

5. Lot size, except as provided in PTMC 17.32.060(C) (minimum lot size is limited to 3,000 square feet);

6. Lot width;

7. Engineering design standards;

8. Multifamily and mixed use development standards contained in Chapters 17.36 and 17.40 PTMC;

9. Maximum floor area ratio in the C-II/MU zone.

B. Standards which may not be modified or altered are:

1. Height of building or structure in all residential zones;

2. Shoreline regulations when the property is located in an area under the jurisdiction of the Port Townsend shoreline master program;

3. Standards pertaining to development in environmentally sensitive areas;

4. Regulations pertaining to nonconforming uses; and

5. Regulatory standards and requirements pertaining to the preservation of historic structures located within the National Register Historic District.

C. Basis for Approval of Alternative Development Standards. Approval of alternative development standards for PUDs differs from the variance procedure described in Chapter 17.86 PTMC in that rather than being based upon a hardship or unusual circumstance related to a specific property, the approval of alternative development standards proposed by a planned unit development shall be based upon the criteria listed in this section. In evaluating a planned development which proposes to modify the development standards of the underlying use zone, the city shall consider and base its findings upon the ability of the proposal to satisfy the following criteria:

1. The proposed planned development shall be compatible with surrounding properties, especially related to:

a. Landscaping and buffering of buildings, parking, loading and storage areas;

b. Public safety;

c. Site access, on-site circulation and off-street parking;

d. Light and shadow impacts;

e. Generation of nuisance irritants such as noise, smoke, dust, odor, glare, vibration or other undesirable impacts;

f. Architectural design of buildings and harmonious use of materials;

2. The unique characteristics of the subject property;

3. The unique characteristics of the proposed use(s);

4. The arrangement of buildings and open spaces as they relate to various uses within or adjacent to the planned development;

5. Visual impact of the planned development upon the surrounding area;

6. Public improvements proposed in connection with the planned development;

7. Preservation of unique natural features of the property; and

8. The public benefit derived by allowing the proposed alteration of development standards. (Ord. 3129 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.100 Preliminary approval criteria.

The following criteria are the minimum measures by which each proposed PUD will be considered:

A. PUDs shall be given preliminary approval, including preliminary approval subject to conditions, upon finding by the city that all of the following have been satisfied:

e. Any other applicable city, state or federal regulations, policies or plans, except those standards proposed for modification;

2. Utilities and other public services necessary to serve the needs of the proposed PUD shall be made available, including open spaces, drainage ways, streets, alleys, other public ways, potable water, transit facilities, sanitary sewers, parks, playgrounds, schools, sidewalks and other improvements that assure safe walking conditions for students who walk to and from school;

3. The probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed PUD, together with any practical means of mitigating adverse impacts, have been considered such that the proposal will not have an unacceptable adverse effect upon the quality of the environment, in accordance with Chapters 19.04 PTMC and 43.21C RCW;

4. Approving the proposed PUD will serve the public use and interest and adequate provision has been made for the public health, safety, and general welfare;

5. The proposed PUD satisfies all criteria set forth in PTMC 17.32.070 through 17.32.090, as applicable; and

6. The proposed PUD will be superior to or more innovative than conventional development and will provide greater public benefit without additional probable significant adverse impacts to public health, safety or the environment, than available through the use of conventional zoning and/or development standards.

B. Notwithstanding approval criteria set forth in subsection A, in accordance with RCW 58.17.120, as now adopted and hereafter amended, a proposed PUD may be denied because of flood, inundation or swamp conditions. Where any portion of the proposed PUD lies within both a flood control zone, as specified by Chapter 19.05 PTMC and Chapter 86.16 RCW, and either the one percent flood hazard area or the regulatory floodway, the city shall not approve the PUD unless it imposes a condition requiring the applicant to comply with Chapter 19.05 PTMC and any written recommendations of the Washington Department of Ecology. In such cases, no development permit associated with the proposed PUD shall be issued by the city until flood control problems have been resolved.

C. Preliminary approval does not constitute approval to obtain any building permits or begin construction of the project. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

D. PUD Consolidated with Binding Site Plan. A PUD consolidated with a binding site plan application shall be reviewed for compliance with all standards and criteria in Chapter 18.20 PTMC.

E. In addition to review under all requirements of PTMC Title 18, based on comments from city departments and applicable agencies, the city shall review the proposal subject to the criteria contained in this chapter, and shall approve any such proposal only when consistent with all the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.120 Performance guarantees – PUD agreement.

To ensure that the development is carried out in accordance with the proposed design and the conditions of project approval, prior to final approval, the city shall require that the applicant enter into written agreement with the city, which agreement shall constitute CC&Rs binding upon all future purchasers, tenants and occupants of the PUD. Recordation of a signed PUD Agreement shall be a precondition to final approval of the PUD. The PUD agreement may include as applicable, and without limitation, the following:

A. An adequate guarantee providing for the permanent preservation, retention and maintenance of all open space and other public areas;

B. Where private reservation of open space area(s) are to be reserved and protected against building development, the applicant shall convey to the city an open space easement over such open space areas restricting the area against any future building or use except as is consistent with providing landscaped open space for the aesthetic and recreational enjoyment of the surrounding residences. Buildings or uses for noncommercial recreational or cultural purposes compatible with the open space objective may be permitted only where specifically authorized as part of the development plan;

C. The care and maintenance of open space reservations shall be assured either by establishment of appropriate management organization for the project or by agreement with the city for establishment of a special service district for the project area on the basis of which the city shall provide the necessary maintenance service and levy the cost thereof as a special assessment on the tax bills of properties within the project area. The agreement shall provide the city with the right to carry out, and levy an assessment for the cost of, any maintenance as necessary if it is not otherwise taken care of to the satisfaction of the city. The manner of assuring maintenance and assessing such cost to individual properties shall be determined prior to the approval of the final PUD plans and shall be included in the title to each property;

D. Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservation shall be established in a manner acceptable to the city;

E. Where bonus densities are obtained for low-income housing development, the applicant shall provide an assurance that the low-income housing will be maintained on the property for not less than 40 years and that project design and measures to ensure compatibility with adjacent land uses shall be maintained throughout the 40-year term. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.32.130 Modifications to an approved PUD.

A. Minor modifications to a previously approved preliminary PUD may be requested by the applicant and approved by the DSD director subject to the provisions for Type I decisions in Chapter 20.01 PTMC. However, minor modifications shall under no circumstances include:

1. Substantial modification or relocation of a lot, tract or parcel boundary line or the location or relocation of a street;

2. A reduction in any perimeter setback;

3. An increase in the residential density or gross floor area of the project;

4. A reduction of the area set aside for common open space;

5. Any relocation of the area set aside for common open space in a manner which makes it less accessible or usable to the public or the occupants of the development;

6. Any change in the landscape buffers resulting in a reduction in width or density of planting between the development and adjoining properties;

7. A substantial change in the points of access, including any change to a different street;

17.34.010 Purpose and intent.

The general purposes of the cottage housing development design standards are as follows:

A. A cottage housing development is an alternative type of detached housing providing small residences for households of typically one to two individuals. Cottage housing is provided as part of the city’s overall housing strategy which intends to encourage affordability, innovation and variety in housing design and site development while ensuring compatibility with existing neighborhoods, and to promote a variety of housing choices to meet the needs of a population diverse in age, income, household composition and individual needs.

B. The cottage housing development design standards contained in this section are intended to create a small community of cottages oriented around open space that is pedestrian-oriented and minimizes the visibility of off-street parking. These design standards are intended to ensure that cottage housing developments include pedestrian amenities and take advantage of existing natural features on the site including topography and vegetation. The cottage housing development design standards are intended to maintain traditional cottage amenities and proportions and ensure that cottage housing developments contribute to the overall community character. Because there may be alternative designs that meet the objectives of the design standards, Chapter 17.46 PTMC provides an alternative design review process to consider other acceptable ways to accomplish the objectives of this section.

C. Cottage housing may allow higher residential density than is normally allowed in the underlying zone district. This increased density is possible through the use of smaller than average home sizes, clustered parking, and site design standards.

D. Cottage housing developments proposed in the R-I zone are subject to special density standards and additional conditional use permit approval criteria. These special standards recognize that land located in the R-I zone is more likely to have stormwater related constraints, contain or be located in close proximity to environmentally sensitive areas, and/or lack full urban infrastructure at the time of development.

E. All cottage housing developments are subject to current city stormwater standards and shall incorporate stormwater low impact development techniques whenever possible. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.020 Applicability, application process, and design review.

Applicability of this section, application procedure and the process for design review is pursuant to Chapter 17.46 PTMC. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.030 Density, number of cottage housing units and minimum lot area.

A. In cottage housing developments the permitted densities shall be as follows:

	Zoning District	R-I Low Density Residential	R-II Medium Density Single-Family	R-III Medium Density Multifamily

	Maximum Cottage Density	1 cottage dwelling unit per 5,000 sf	1 cottage dwelling unit per 2,500 sf	1 cottage dwelling unit per 2,500 sf

	Minimum number of cottages per cottage housing development	4	4	4

	Maximum number of cottages per cottage housing development	8	12	14

	Minimum lot size (accommodates 4 cottages)	20,000 sf	10,000 sf	10,000 sf

B. Projects that exceed the above maximums must be processed as planned unit developments per Chapter 17.32 PTMC. (Ord. 3247 § 1 (Exh. E), 2020; Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.040 Existing nonconforming structures and accessory dwelling units.

A. On a lot to be used for a cottage housing development, an existing detached single-family residential structure, which may be nonconforming with respect to the standards of this chapter, shall be permitted to remain, but the extent of the nonconformity may not be increased. Such nonconforming dwelling units shall be included in the maximum permitted cottage density.

1. Nonconforming dwelling units may be modified to be more consistent with this chapter. For example, roof pitches may be increased consistent with PTMC 17.34.050, but the building ground floor or total floor area may not be increased greater than permitted by PTMC 17.34.110.

B. New accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are not permitted in cottage housing developments. All residential units in a cottage housing development count towards the maximum permitted density. An existing attached or detached ADU that is accessory to an existing nonconforming single-family structure may be counted as a cottage unit if the property is developed subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.050 Building height.

A. Objective. Structures in cottage housing developments shall be designed to be single story or single story plus a loft. Because the base density is higher and building separation less than on typical residential lots, it is important to maintain a feeling of adequate light and open space by providing more restrictive maximum roof heights and roof proportion standards.

1. The maximum building height permitted for structures in cottage housing developments shall be 18 feet.

2. The highest point of a pitched roof may extend up to 23 feet. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.060 Exterior trim and roof eaves.

A. Objective. Cottage housing development structures shall be provided with substantial exterior trim elements consistent with traditional northwest cottage design and small home craftsmanship. Roofs in cottage housing developments shall have eaves to recognize traditional northwest cottage design traits to efficiently shed rain, and provide rain protection for exterior walls. Departures from these standards (exterior trim and eave requirements) shall be reviewed through the alternative design review process. Alternative exterior trim and eave designs shall demonstrate a coherent cottage housing design based upon traditional design principles including weather protection.

1. Window and door trim with a minimum width of three and one-half inches shall be provided on all cottage housing developments structures.

2. Eaves of at least 12 inches shall be provided on all cottage structures on at least two sides of each building. Where buildings are not square (one set of exterior parallel walls are longer than the other), the eaves shall be provided on the parallel walls that are the longest. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.070 Covered main entry porches.

A. Objective. All residences in cottage housing developments shall be provided with a covered main entry porch to create a private outdoor space protected from the weather and provide a transition from the interior private residential space to the semi-private outdoor space. Covered porches shall be usable both in design and dimension.

1. Cottage homes shall have a covered main entry porch with a floor area measuring at least 60 square feet in size.

2. The floor of the covered main entry porch shall have minimum dimensions of not less than five feet in any direction (length or width). (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.080 Street facing facades.

A. Objective. The street facing facades of cottages in a cottage housing development will contribute to the neighborhood by including attractive design details such as windows, changes in materials, and views of front doors or porches. The main entries of some cottages will be visible from the adjacent streets to provide a visual pedestrian connection with the surrounding neighborhood.

1. All cottages shall have street facing facades that avoid blank walls or appear to “turn their backs” to the street. All cottages shall include one or more of the following on-street facing facades:

a. Changes in exterior siding material and paint color;

b. Windows which may include bay windows; and/or 

c. Building modulation with a depth measuring at least one foot.

2. At least one cottage shall have its front main entry door and/or front porches visible from each street frontage. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.090 Lot coverage area.

A. Objective. Cottage housing developments shall not exceed underlying lot coverage standards for the respective zoning district to maintain residential neighborhood character and the balance of built structures to open spaces.

1. The maximum lot coverage permitted for all structures in cottage housing developments shall not exceed the requirements for the underlying zoning district contained in Table 17.16.030. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.100 Impervious surface area – R-I zone limitation.

A. Objective. Cottage housing developments located in the R-I zones shall limit their impervious surface area in recognition of the stormwater and soil conditions present in the R-I zone and to prevent adverse stormwater impacts.

1. Cottage housing developments in the R-I zoning district shall be limited to an impervious surface area of 40 percent of the total site area (excluding rights-of-way).

2. The use of paver stones, pervious pavement, grass-crete, or other types of low impact stormwater development techniques are encouraged for walkways and parking areas. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.110 Cottage floor area.

A. Objective. Structures in cottage housing developments shall be designed to be single story or single story plus a loft. Residences in cottage housing developments are primarily intended for one- and two-person households and their occasional guests. Maintaining the maximum square footage of residences in cottage housing developments is necessary to prevent overbuilding of the site and to not exceed available off-street parking.

1. The maximum ground floor area for an individual principal structure in a cottage housing development shall be as follows:

a. For at least 50 percent of the units, the ground floor area may not exceed 650 square feet. 

b. For no more than 50 percent of the units, the ground floor area may be up to 800 square feet.

c. The net total floor area of each cottage shall not exceed one and one-half times the area of the main level. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.120 Yards – Building setbacks from exterior lot lines.

A. Objective. Exterior lot line building setbacks in cottage housing developments are based upon setbacks in the R-II zoning district. These yard setbacks are appropriate based upon the allowed density of cottage housing as well as the small size of the structures. Flexible setbacks are allowed per the discretion of the BCD and public works directors to obtain improved site design and to avoid impacting existing physical features on the site such as trees.

1. Front yard and street side yard on corner lots shall be 10 feet: 

a. Exception: The BCD director in consultation with the public works director may authorize the setback averaging from the public right-of-way. In such cases the setback average shall be 10 feet and at no point less than five feet where the location of all structures, landscaping and other improvements will not conflict with future improvements in the right-of-way. Fences may not be placed in the right-of-way and are subject to Chapter 17.68 PTMC. 

2. Rear Yard Building Setback. The minimum rear yard shall be 10 feet, unless abutting an alley, then the minimum setback shall be five feet.

3. Side Yard Building Setback – Interior Lot Lines. The minimum side yard setback shall be five feet for interior lot lines. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.130 Cottage housing development building separation.

A. Objective. Structures within cottage housing developments shall observe minimum setbacks from other cottage housing development structures to avoid overcrowding the site and to maintain a sense of privacy within the cottages themselves.

1. All buildings within a cottage housing development shall maintain a minimum separation of 10 feet from cottages within a cottage housing development measured from the nearest point of the exterior walls. Accessory buildings shall comply with building code requirements for separation from noncottage structures. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.140 Common open space.

A. Objective. Open space that is commonly owned by all members of a cottage housing development is an important feature of any site design. It is intended that the open space be adequately sized and centrally located with individual cottage entrances oriented towards the open space.

1. Common Open Space. A minimum of 400 square feet per cottage unit of common open space is required. Parking areas, yard setbacks, spaces between buildings of 10 feet or less in width, private open space, and driveways do not qualify as common open space.

2. Proximity to Common Open Space. 

a. At least 50 percent of the cottage units shall abut a common open space, all of the cottage units shall be within 60 feet walking distance measured from the nearest entrance of the cottage along the shortest safe walking route to the nearest point of the common open space. The common open space shall have cottages abutting at least two sides. 

b. For the purposes of cottage housing, “common open space” shall be the central space that may be used by all occupants of the cottage complex. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.150 Private open space.

A. Objective. Each residential unit in a cottage housing development shall be provided an area of private open space. The private open space shall separate the main entrance to the cottage from the common open space to create a sense of privacy and shall be oriented to take advantage of solar orientation and other natural features to create a small but pleasant private yard area. The private open space may be separated from the common open space with a small hedge, picket fence, or other similar visual separation to create a sense of separate ownership.

1. Each cottage unit shall be provided with a minimum of 200 square feet of usable private open space separated from the common open space by a hedge or fence not to exceed 36 inches in height.

2. No dimension of the private open space shall be less than eight feet. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.160 Tree conservation.

A. Objective. Cottage housing developments shall be designed to incorporate existing trees to the extent possible. New trees shall be located to create amenities in the common open space, private open space, provide shade where appropriate, to create separation between buildings when desired, and to screen and soften the perimeter of parking areas and street facing sides of cottage housing developments.

1. Preservation of existing trees, and/or new trees, shall be provided consistent with Chapter 19.06 PTMC, Article III, Standards for Tree Conservation. Native trees and other vegetation shall be preserved to the extent possible and the overall site design shall take advantage of the location of existing trees as well as natural openings or clearings on forested sites. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.170 Stormwater low impact development techniques.

A. Objective. Cottage housing developments shall be designed to take advantage of open space and landscaped features to utilize stormwater low impact development techniques including natural filtration and on-site infiltration of stormwater.

1. Low impact development techniques for stormwater management shall be used wherever possible. Such techniques may include the use of pervious pavers in parking areas and for walkways, directing roof drains and parking lot runoff to landscape beds, green or living roofs, and the use of rain barrels.

2. In the R-I zone, cottages shall be located so as to maximize natural stormwater functions. In this zone, cottages shall be clustered and parking areas shall be located to preserve as much contiguous, permanently undeveloped open space and native vegetation as possible. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.180 Off-street parking.

A. Objective. Off-street parking space requirements for cottage housing developments shall be less than normally required for detached single-family residences. These reduced standards are based upon the cottages being smaller than average detached single-family homes and on average containing fewer occupants. Off-street parking shall be located and designed to be less visible from frontage streets than the cottages themselves. Off-street parking shall be designed to maintain a pedestrian character for the overall cottage housing development. Clustering parking to the side or rear of a cottage project will most often best accomplish these goals. However, on a site-specific basis, design solutions other than clustering may be found to meet this objective through the alternative design process. Parking areas shall be attractively landscaped to screen parking from adjacent properties and street rights-of-way and shall meet applicable parking lot landscape standards.

1. Parking Ratios.

	Total Net Floor Area of Cottage or Nonconforming Dwelling Unit	Ratio of Off-Street Parking Spaces Required per Cottage or Nonconforming Dwelling Unit

	Up to 1,000 square feet	1.25 parking spaces

	1,001 to 1,200 square feet	1.5 parking spaces

	Existing nonconforming single-family residence	2 parking spaces

2. Off-Street Parking Location. Parking shall be located on the cottage housing development property. Off-street parking lots shall be located to the side or rear of the cottage housing development (see illustrations below). Parking lots shall not be located between the cottage housing development and the primary street frontage.

a. Off-Street Parking Screening. Off-street parking may be located in or under a noncottage parking structure (such as a single or multi-auto carport or garage), but such structures shall not be attached to individual cottages. Uncovered parking is also permitted; provided, that off-street parking shall be screened from direct street view from one or more street facades by garage doors, or by a fence and landscaping. 

b. Preferred locations for parking, in descending order of preference, are as follows:

i. To the rear of cottage housing units accessed by an alley. 
[IMAGE]


ii. To the side of the cottage housing units access by a private driveway.
[IMAGE]


iii. Parking on the side (nonprimary street) screened from the side street by either garage doors, landscaping, and/or fencing. 
[IMAGE]


c. Parking Lot Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping shall comply with the requirements of PTMC 17.72.190. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.190 Exterior lighting and heating/cooling equipment noise.

A. Objective. Cottage housing developments should be designed to minimize light and noise impacts both within the development and to adjacent properties.

1. Where provided, exterior lighting shall be mounted as low as possible, pointed downward, and the light source shall be shielded from direct observation from above, adjacent properties, and public rights-of-way. Lighting “spillover” to adjacent properties shall be avoided.

2. Heating (and cooling, if applicable) equipment for cottage housing developments shall be designed to cause little or no noise impacts within the development and to adjacent properties. To help prevent noise problems, heat pumps shall not be used for cottage housing developments. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.200 Required separation of cottage housing developments in the R-I and R-II zoning districts.

A. Objective. Cottage housing developments in single-family zoning districts shall be separated from each other by a minimum distance to promote housing-type diversity, to reduce potential cumulative impacts of cottage housing development, and to help protect neighborhood character.

1. Each cottage housing development in the R-I or R-II zoning districts shall be separated from any other cottage housing development in the R-I or R-II zoning district by a distance of at least 1,000 feet or one block, whichever is greater. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.210 Ownership and residential use of cottages.

A. All cottage housing developments shall be developed utilizing the procedures of Chapter 18.20 PTMC, Binding Site Plans, except that an association, cooperative or other similar ownership technique may be substituted for the requirement of residential condominiums. Appropriate documentation of formal legal ownership of the development shall be recorded with the Jefferson County auditor’s office.

B. Cottages are for residential use only and may not be operated as transient accommodations. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).


17.34.220 Alternative site design.

It is possible that an alternative design may fulfill the intent of this chapter while not complying with the provisions herein. Requests for alternative designs shall be processed pursuant to Chapter 17.46 PTMC, Commercial, Multifamily, Cottage Housing Developments, and Mixed Use Architectural and Site Design Review Processes. (Ord. 2864 § 3, 2004).

Zone allowing greater bulk.
[IMAGE]


Good use of articulation could result in a form similar to this.
[IMAGE]


This higher density multifamily building “steps back” to conform to the abutting lower density property. This use of modulation helps the multifamily building fit into the neighborhood.

Preferred: The multifamily buildings depicted as “A” and “B” below have been built on an identical site. However, building example “A” incorporates design clues from the surrounding neighborhood. Building example “A” covers roughly the same lot areas building example “B” and provides for the same number of units, while “fitting in” with its surroundings.
[IMAGE]


Undesirable: Multifamily building example “B” has been built on a site surrounded by single-family development. The building bears no resemblance to the existing neighborhood, and looks out of place. 

(Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.36.110 Privacy.

A. Requirement. Buildings shall be oriented for privacy, to the extent practicable, both within the project and to the neighborhood.

17.36.120 Facade, footprint, and roof articulation.

A. Requirement. Buildings shall have a common design theme that provides variety and character within a project. Walls and roofs shall include separations, changes in plane and height, and architectural elements such as balconies, porches, dormers, and cross-gables.

B. Techniques for complying with the requirement in subsection A of this section include, but are not limited to:

1. Facade modulation – stepping back or extending forward a portion of the facade for each interval;

2. Articulating each interval with architectural elements like a porch, balcony, bay window, and/or covered entry;

3. Articulating the roof line by stepping the roof and by emphasizing dormers, chimneys, or gables; and

4. Providing a ground or wall-mounted fixture, a trellis, a tree, or other site feature within each interval.

C. The following illustrations depict multifamily design themes that provide project variety and character:

The general purposes of the commercial and mixed use design standards are as follows:

A. To help implement the city of Port Townsend’s:

1. Comprehensive plan;

2. Gateway development plan; and

3. Nonmotorized transportation plan;

B. Promote development in the city’s commercial and mixed use zones that is compatible with the historic character and pedestrian orientation of Port Townsend, encouraging and requiring commercial development that enables the safe circulation of pedestrians with minimal vehicle-pedestrian conflicts, softens the auto-dominated nature of the zoning district, and provides a regional design, which invites the pedestrian into ground floor commercial establishments; 

C. Enrich the quality of the commercial and mixed use zones’ built and natural environment;

D. Foster development that is compatible with and implements the city’s “community direction statement,” Chapter III of the comprehensive plan;

E. Promote distinct communities and senses of place that strengthen the commercial and mixed use districts as commercial service destinations for Port Townsend’s residents and visitors;

F. Provide clear directions to public and private decision makers regarding the city’s property development expectations; and

G. Require building design that is compatible with adopted requirements, while allowing design professionals guidance that is flexible and encourages creative solutions. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.030 Process information.

For preapplication process, applicability, application process, notice requirements, permit review process, alternative designs, and other process information, see Chapter 17.46 PTMC. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.040 Commercial and mixed use short plats, subdivisions, and binding site plans – Block sizes, building separation and street layout.

A. Objective. New or modified commercial or mixed use short plats, subdivisions, and binding site plans or new commercial or mixed use developments shall be designed to provide safe and convenient vehicle, nonmotorized, and pedestrian access to individual lots and building sites. All lots, blocks, and building sites shall be configured to be compatible with the size, shape, and patterns of Port Townsend streets and blocks established in the late 1800s, including separation of blocks by street rights-of-way, while giving consideration to unusual pre-existing property dimensions, topography, and landscape buffer requirements.

1. The maximum size for blocks in new or modified plats or binding site plans, or for building sites on undivided land, shall not exceed 40,000 square feet.

2. Each block or building site shall be separated from other blocks or building sites by a public right-of-way or public access easement so as to be surrounded on all sides by such right-of-way or access easement.

3. The standard Port Townsend commercial block is square. However, new blocks or building sites may vary in dimension (up to a maximum size of 40,000 square feet) to allow for interior alleys or rectangular, triangular, or other geometric shapes as necessary.

4. For purposes of this section, a “block” shall mean a group of lots, tracts or parcels within well-defined and fixed boundaries surrounded by public rights-of-way or easements.

5. In the C-I, C-II, and C-II(H) general commercial zoning district, multiple structures on a single property reviewed as a single development proposal, or built in phases, may not be attached to exceed 40,000 square feet of ground floor area. Such multiple structures must be separated by at least 60 feet when their combined ground floor area exceeds 40,000 square feet. Reductions in building separation may be considered through a departure when the space in between the buildings will be used for pedestrian and emergency vehicle access only (i.e., not open to daily vehicle traffic). (Ord. 2920 § 17, 2005).


17.44.050 Maximum building setback from primary street frontage. 

A. Objective. Buildings shall be oriented towards the primary street frontage and public paths and/or sidewalks. Buildings on corner lots should be oriented towards the primary intersection.

1. Where properties front one or more streets, new buildings shall be located no more than 25 feet from the primary street frontage.

Illustration No. 1:
[IMAGE]


a. Exception: This maximum front yard setback does not apply where a property fronts on Sims Way or Discovery Road in the “forest corridor” as defined in PTMC 17.44.070. In those areas a vegetative buffer of existing trees and/or infill plantings will screen all or a portion of a commercial site from Sims Way. 

b. Exception: Accessory and secondary buildings need not comply with the maximum setback standards where a primary building occupies the available street frontage.

2. Buildings on corner lots should be oriented toward the primary intersection and the primary and secondary street frontages, while parking and auto access shall be located away from the primary intersection corners. 

Illustration No. 2:
[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]


a. The use of lot corner entrances, plazas, signage, and/or landscaping is encouraged to accentuate corner sites.

Illustration No. 3: 
[IMAGE]


B. Objective. Where buildings are separated from the public sidewalk along the primary street frontage, the space should contain public and pedestrian amenities. 

1. Buildings may be separated from the sidewalk by plazas, landscaping, benches, bicycle racks, trash cans, and other pedestrian amenities.

Illustration No. 4:
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.060 Topography.

A. Objective. Existing trees, topography and other existing natural features shall be incorporated into the project design.

1. To the extent reasonable and practicable incorporate natural grades into the overall site plan.

a. Incorporate natural features such as large rocks or boulders into landscaping design. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.070 Gateway Forest Corridor.

Objective: As the two main entrances to Port Townsend, Sims Way and Discovery Road, have historically appeared as forested corridors, new development in the Gateway Forest Corridor (as identified in the 1991 Gateway Development Plan) shall preserve this character to the extent possible. 

A. Along Sims Way from the intersection of Mill Road to a point 300 feet west of Howard Street, preserve all native vegetation to a minimum depth of 50 feet. Vegetation in the Sims Way right-of-way may not be counted towards this natural buffer. 

1. On-site trees in the 50-foot buffer may be counted towards landscaping and tree retention requirements in PTMC 17.72.190 and Chapter 19.06 PTMC.

2. Native vegetation in the forest corridor buffer may be removed only for approved driveways onto Sims Way, utility corridors, or pedestrian pathways. 

B. Along Discovery Road from the intersection of Mill Road to the intersection of Howard Street, native trees (minimum six-inch dbh) and other existing vegetation should be preserved to the extent possible. Such retention is the strongly preferred method of fulfilling landscaping and tree conservation provisions of PTMC 17.72.190 and Chapter 19.06 PTMC. However, on-site development need not be totally visually screened from Discovery Road. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.080 Landscaping.

A. Objective. Landscaping shall be incorporated into new development design to soften the manmade environment, provide vegetative buffers, open space, and mitigate any unavoidable loss of existing native vegetation. The preferred method of landscaping is to first incorporate and preserve existing trees and shrubs, topography and other existing natural features into the project design. Any unavoidable loss of existing native vegetation shall be mitigated. 

1. All proposals must comply with the tree retention standards of Chapter 19.06 PTMC, Tree Conservation. 

2. Landscaping in parking lots shall conform to requirements of PTMC 17.72.190 and Chapter 19.06 PTMC.

3. Landscaping techniques including living plant material and supporting elements shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Landscape open areas created by building modulation.

b. Retain natural vegetation and undisturbed open space.

c. Use plants that require low amounts of water, including native drought-resistant species. 

d. Locate trees on storefront street frontages at appropriate spacing so that at maturity building signage and entrance are clearly visible from the street and sidewalk.

e. Plant a mix of evergreen and deciduous plants to maintain year-round color and interest.

f. Incorporate on-site natural objects such as rocks, boulders and tree stumps into landscape design where possible.

g. Shrubs, grasses and other nontree vegetation shall be included in the plan as appropriate to the site on a case-by-case basis.

4. An irrigation method shall be included in the landscaping plan. Irrigation shall be required immediately after planting and May through October thereafter or as recommended by a landscape professional. Developers should consider installing underground irrigation systems whenever possible to avoid drought loss.

5. When used, detention ponds and bioswales shall be incorporated into the project landscaping using plants and irrigation recommended by a professional familiar with such projects. 

B. Optional landscaping techniques may also include where appropriate: 

1. Providing frameworks such as trellises or arbors for plants;

2. Incorporating planter guards, retaining walls, or low planter walls as part of the architecture;

3. Incorporating upper story planter boxes, ‘green roofs,’ roof gardens or plants;

4. Incorporating outdoor furniture into the landscaping plan.

C. The director may consider a waiver of certain landscaping requirements if significant existing (especially native) vegetation and topography are preserved. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.090 Off‑street parking lots.

A. Objective. Development shall minimize the impact of parking on the building’s relationship to the street and pedestrian‑oriented character and character of the neighborhood.

1. Off-street parking shall be located to the side or rear of buildings. (Waterside properties see subsection (A)(4) of this section.)

2. Parking lots shall not be located between the building and the primary street frontage.

3. Off‑street parking shall occupy no more than 30 percent of the primary street frontage nor more than 75 percent of any secondary street frontage for corner lots.

4. In the event that a building is located on a waterfront lot, parking shall be located to the side of the building, and not between the building and the water.

5. Adjacent developments are encouraged to link parking areas and access ways in order to encourage combining of shopping trips and pedestrian activity and to reduce redundant driveways.

6. Low impact development techniques for stormwater management should be used wherever possible.

Illustration No. 5:
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.100 On‑street parking.

A. Objective. On-street parking is encouraged along the streets, access drives, and alleys in order to provide convenient access and reduce the need for off-street parking lots.

1. The required number of off-street parking spaces shall be reduced by two spaces for each developed on-street parking space pursuant to PTMC 17.72.120(C).

2. Allow use of on-street parking for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements if such a location meets ADA design standards and would better serve the public than off-street ADA parking.

Illustration No. 6:

(Ord. 2920 § 7, 2005; Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.110 Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly commercial development.

A. Objective. Provide safe, bicycle and pedestrian‑friendly development.

1. Walkways shall be provided between the primary abutting street and the main pedestrian entrances to buildings.

2. The interruption of sidewalks by driveways should be minimized. Where driveways cross sidewalks, the sidewalks should remain raised with a curb cut and ramp over the sidewalk provided so cars may pass over the sidewalk rather than requiring pedestrians to step down to an interrupting driveway. 

3. Pedestrian access shall be provided between commercial sites and adjacent areas. Existing informal pathway locations and future walkway locations shown in the nonmotorized transportation plan shall be taken into consideration when locating new paths.

4. Bicycle locking racks that support the entire bicycle frame, not just the front wheel, shall be provided. Bicycle racks shall be located as closely as possible to primary building entrances (generally within 20 feet) and shall be lit during evening business hours per PTMC 17.44.180. New buildings should provide covered bicycle racks, especially those used by employees. 

Illustration No. 7:
[IMAGE]


B. Objective. Provide safe walkways for pedestrians through off‑street parking lots and from adjacent streets and properties. 

1. Pedestrian walkways in off‑street parking lots shall be physically separated from vehicle travel lanes. In large parking lots with parallel multiple parking lanes, pedestrian walkways shall be provided between the parking stalls.

2. Pedestrian crossings should be short and well marked.

3. In large parking lots with multiple parallel rows of parking, direct primary vehicle traffic away from the building entrance; any traffic lanes adjacent to the building should be preserved primarily for emergency vehicle and pedestrian access to the building. 

Illustration No. 8:
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.120 Commercial development adjacent to residential zones.

A. Objective. Buildings shall be designed to ensure that building massing, height, and scale provide sensitive transition to adjoining residential neighborhoods. When abutting an R-I, R-II or R-III zoning district, the project’s landscaping plan must include provisions for vegetative screening between the project and the residential property.

1. New developments whose bulk and scale may negatively impact adjacent residential areas shall mitigate the effect through careful site planning and architectural design. Possible mitigation techniques include, but are not limited to, the following: 

a. Locating open space and preserving existing vegetation on the site’s edge to further separate the building from less intensive uses;

b. Stepping down the massing of the building along the site’s edge;

c. Limiting the length of or articulating building facades to reflect adjacent residential patterns; and

d. Creative use and ongoing maintenance of landscaping, such as berms, mounds, rockeries, living fences, and swales. The landscape plan shall include a greenbelt, at least an eight-foot-wide buffer to create a year-round visual screen of at least six feet in height. The buffer should be designed to avoid the appearance of a straight line or ‘wall’ of uniform plant material, and shall be wide enough to accommodate the planted species at maturation.

Illustration No. 9:
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.130 Building design, materials, and colors.

A. Objective. New development should recognize the city’s historic architectural heritage through the use of building materials and proportions compatible with those design principles inherent in historic architecture without replicating historical buildings.

1. Roof Design.

a. Roof design shall reduce the mass and scale of buildings, add visual interest and prevent reflective glare. Flat roofs shall have parapets to conceal the roof and mechanical equipment from ground level views. Sloping roofs shall have three or more roof planes.

b. When designing rooftops visible from hillsides, special attention shall be given to prevention of reflective glare and placement/design of mechanical equipment. Roof gardens or “living roofs” may be considered and are encouraged.

2. Overhanging eaves are encouraged on sloped roofs.

3. Exterior siding consisting of wood, brick, and/or other materials with “natural” textures is encouraged. The use of recycled and “ecologically friendly” materials is also encouraged.

4. Exterior building materials shall be of similar type (e.g., wood or masonry) on all sides of a building, except that embellishments and details proposed for the street side frontage(s) of the building need not be carried through on other sides.

5. Exterior walls shall not be constructed of tilt-up concrete.

6. Building colors should be compatible with other buildings as well as natural and topographic features in the vicinity. The use of colors that emphasize earth tones typical of the Port Townsend area or those selected from the historic preservation committee’s color palette of tertiary colors are encouraged. Bright colors should be minimized or used for minor architectural accents rather than on major portions of the building.

7. Building fascias shall not be used as sign platforms.

8. Departures From the Sign Code Maximum Height Limit for Signs in the C-I, C-II, and C-II(H) Zones to Exceed 17-Foot Height Limit. In reviewing such departure requests the committee shall recognize that signs should generally be pedestrian-oriented, but that in some cases good design may call for taller signage. All signage otherwise shall conform to the provisions of Chapter 17.76 PTMC.

9. Buildings should be provided with a distinct “base” through the use of materials, texture, or massing.

10. Towers of up to 100 square feet in plan view, which exceed the height limit of the applicable zoning district by up to 10 feet, may be considered and approved through the departure process.

Illustration No. 11:
[IMAGE]


11. Multistory buildings are strongly encouraged. Residential development is permitted outright on upper floors and is encouraged.

12. When buildings include residences on upper floors, rooftop gardens and upper floor terraces and decks are encouraged and may partially fulfill landscaping requirements.

13. Walls shall appear to be composed of relatively small increments. No wall segment on a street frontage shall be longer than 30 feet. Walls may be articulated in two or more of the following ways:

a. Reveals;

b. Recesses (at least two feet in depth or five percent of wall length whichever is larger);

c. Offsets;

d. Overhangs, porches and covered walkways;

e. Providing window and door openings with substantial trim elements;

f. Projecting bays or upper floors;

g. Stepped back upper floors;

h. Changes in roof form;

i. Changes in materials;    

j. Permanently installed and maintained trellises or vegetation.

14. New development should locate windows, skylights, open spaces, and decks to take advantage of southern exposure. Buildings and canopies should be designed to utilize natural light to reduce energy costs.

15. Building placement and design shall consider shadow impacts to adjacent properties and minimize these impacts to the extent reasonable and practicable. For example, where building features are nonfunctional or decorative (parapets, unused attic space) such features should be reduced in scale where shadowing of adjacent properties will occur. (Ord. 2920 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.140 Vehicle canopies.

A. Objective. Freestanding or attached vehicle canopies and porte cocheres associated with gas stations, convenience stores, or drive-throughs shall function as structures rather than signs. Vehicle canopies shall not function as sign platforms.

1. Vehicle canopies are structures and are subject to the building design, materials, and color criteria of PTMC 17.44.130. Canopies shall follow the colors, material and design used on primary building(s). Canopy design should reflect the architectural design of the primary buildings.

2. The purpose of vehicle canopies is to provide weather protection, not to provide an elevated sign platform. No signs other than directional signs may be erected on canopy structures; directional signs shall be mounted no higher than 10 feet above grade. Signs shall meet all the provisions of Chapter 17.76 PTMC.

3. Vehicle canopies shall have a minimum roof pitch of 3/12 and display the underside of the roof structure. Skylights are encouraged.

4. Clearance under canopies shall not exceed 14 feet, seven inches.

(Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.150 Building entrances.

A. Objective. The primary entrances of buildings shall be identified and highlighted through architectural details, lighting, and signage. The design of buildings shall enhance the relationship between buildings and streets by creating easily identifiable building entrances.

1. Entrances shall be visible from the adjoining primary street.

2. Techniques that may be used to highlight primary building entrances include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Recessed entry;

b. Glazed door;

c. Roof line emphasis;

d. Windows above entry;

e. Projecting sign above doorway, subject to sign code;

f. Canopy, marquee, or awning above entry;

g. Head molding or decorative lintel above doorway;

h. Contrasting, decorative finish materials;

i. Street address posted prominently above or near the building entrance.

Illustration No. 13:

(Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.160 Weather protection.

A. Objective. Buildings should provide protection for pedestrians from adverse weather conditions.

1. Overhangs, marquees, and awnings that provide protection for pedestrians and bicycle racks from adverse weather conditions should be incorporated at entrances, along pedestrian pathways, and at transportation waiting areas.

Illustration No. 14:
[IMAGE]


2. Port Townsend often experiences strong wind conditions. Doorways should be oriented or sheltered so that doors can be opened easily and safely when strong seasonal winds are present. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.170 Transparency.

A. Objective. Buildings shall provide generous amounts of windows to create ground floors with a “transparent” quality in order to provide visual interest.

1. Windows shall cover at least 30 percent of the facade area (as measured from grade to eight feet above grade) facing the primary street and also the secondary street on corner lots. The standard shall be applied to each individual street facade. Windows are also encouraged on upper floors.

2. Windows shall not consist of reflective glass.

3. Windows should begin at least 12 inches above grade rather than continue down to grade level. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. A), 2003).


17.44.180 Lighting.

A. Objective. All exterior lighting, including that used to illuminate signs, shall be designed to reduce glare impacts to adjacent properties and public rights-of-way, to use energy efficiently, and to reduce nighttime “light pollution.”

1. An exterior lighting plan shall be included with the design review application pursuant to the requirements of PTMC 17.46.040.

2.    a. All exterior lighting, including that to illuminate signs, shall be pointed downward and shielded from direct observation from the air, adjacent properties, and public rights-of-way. Lighting “spillover” to adjacent properties shall be minimized. Lamps shall use recessed or flat lenses. Light fixtures, shall be “full cutoff” fixtures as defined by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America.

b. Alternative. If use of fixtures which do not meet the “full cutoff” definition are proposed, other fixtures may be used if it is determined by the DSD director that no significant light pollution or trespass will result and if the maximum initial lumens generated by each fixture does not exceed 1,500 lumens in total (approximately equivalent to an 18-watt compact fluorescent or 100-watt incandescent bulb).

3. Lighting in exterior canopies shall be recessed so that the lens does not drop below the level of the canopy.

4. Exterior light poles shall not exceed a height of 17 feet above grade, including the base.

5. When lighting is used for security, the use of motion sensors and/or timers is required.

6. Exterior lighting shall be limited to nighttime business hours only. Lighting shall be located near the activity needing illumination. Walkways, entrances, and parking areas may be lit during nighttime business hours, but such lighting shall be the minimum necessary for safety. Lighting in parking lots should be of uniform intensity, since the eye cannot easily adapt to areas of darkness and brightness in proximity to one another.

7. Buildings shall not be outlined with neon or other lighting, except seasonal lighting.

8. If, once installed, lighting is found to be performing in violation of these standards, the city may require the business owner to take corrective action to bring the lighting into compliance.

9. Lighting shall be maintained to meet these standards at all times.

10. Nighttime lighting of the American flag is exempt from the provisions of this chapter, except that such lighting shall not provide direct glare to neighboring properties or traffic.

17.44.190 Support elements.

A. Objective. Mechanical elements, loading areas, trash, and recycling containers shall be located and/or screened to minimize their visibility from public view.

1. Refuse and storage containers shall be screened with built and/or landscaped confinements.

2. Refuse and storage areas should be located to the rear or side of the property and away from adjacent streets and residential property.

3. The design review advisory committee shall meet once with the applicant or his/her representative. The design review meeting shall consist of a presentation by the project proponent that focuses on how the proposed design meets the criteria of the design guidelines. The committee will ask clarifying questions and take public comment if it chooses. The committee shall review how the proposed project meets the identified guidelines, and if a departure from the standards has been requested, if it is appropriate. The committee shall provide a recommendation to the DSD director/hearing examiner for approval, approval with conditions, or denial.

4. The meeting is open to the public; public testimony is not solicited but may be accepted at the discretion of the committee.

5. Meetings will not be continued except at the request of the applicant. The proponent may request additional meetings with staff and/or the committee, for instance, in circumstances where a departure has not been favorably received, and the applicant has subsequently made extensive revision and desires reconsideration of his request. Should the proposed project be found to have one or more guidelines that have not been successfully addressed, the committee or staff will work with the applicant to remedy, if possible, the identified circumstance. If it is not possible to come to a workable solution, the committee may recommend denial of the proposal. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-6 § 6), 2010; Ord. 2920 § 12, 2005; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2864 § 4, 2004; Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. C), 2003).

21.  Minimum building separation in the C-II general commercial zoning district when multiple buildings, if attached, would exceed a ground floor area of 40,000 square feet where the separation is proposed to be less than 60 feet and will be used for pedestrian and emergency vehicle use only.

C. Departure Approval Process. Before a departure can be approved by the director, the director shall first receive and consider the recommendation of the advisory committee. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-6 § 6), 2010; Ord. 2920 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2864 § 4, 2004; Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. C), 2003).


17.46.090 Outcome of review.

A. A completed review form or checklist will comprise the recommendation from staff or the design advisory committee to the DSD director, or to the hearing examiner in the case of Type III/CUP cottage housing developments, including whether the departure provisions have been invoked.

B. If applicable, the SEPA responsible official shall consider the staff/committee recommendation in the SEPA threshold determination, and he or she may incorporate recommended conditions into the SEPA mitigation.

During this seven-day period, interested citizens or aggrieved parties may request in writing a “reconsideration” of the advisory committee recommendation. Such reconsideration requests shall be made in writing, shall state the reasons why a reconsideration request is made, and the relief sought. Upon review of the advisory committee’s recommendation, and after reviewing any requests for reconsideration, the director or hearing examiner may:

1. Issue the design review permit, including any modifications, conditions, or denial of approval; or

2. Return the project to the advisory committee with directions for additional review.

D. The decisionmaker (DSD director or hearing examiner) may not incorporate a departure into a design review permit without first having received and considered the recommendation of the advisory committee.

E. Design review permit conditions shall be incorporated into associated land use and/or building permit.

Upon receipt of a complete building permit application that has been previously reviewed by the advisory committee, the advisory committee shall be contacted and afforded an opportunity to review the completed building permit application for conformity with the design review permit issued for the project. The purpose of this review is to identify any inconsistencies between the design review permit and the completed building permit application. Any inconsistencies shall be remedied prior to issuance of the building permit. This review process shall not interfere with the normal processing timelines for building permit applications. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-6 § 6), 2010; Ord. 2920 § 9, 2006).


17.46.100 Variance criteria.

The determination of what constitutes a vehicle or device, as described above, shall be determined by the city.

13. Transferability. The conditional use permit for a tourist home runs with the land and may be transferred to any other person or legal entity as provided for in Chapter 17.84 PTMC, Conditional Uses. As provided for in PTMC 5.08.140, the associated business license may not be transferred or assigned. (Ord. 3172 § 6 (Exh. E), 2017).


17.57.030 Relationship to other ordinances.

A. Each short term rental, including those in existence on the effective date of this chapter, is subject to the city’s business license requirements, and all stipulations of this subsection regarding location.

17.60.047 Departures.

The director may approve a temporary use permit for a temporary tent encampment that relaxes one or more of the minimum standards in this chapter only when, in addition to satisfying the approval criteria of PTMC 17.60.050, the applicant submits a description of the standard to be modified and demonstrates how the modification would result in a safe encampment with minimal negative impact to the host community under the specific circumstances of the application. In considering whether the modification should be granted, the director shall first consider the effects on the health and safety of encampment residents and the neighboring communities. Modifications shall not be granted if their adverse impact on encampment residents and/or neighboring communities will be greater than those without the modification. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant. (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016).


17.60.050 Approval criteria.

The director of the development services department may approve, or modify and approve, an application for a temporary use permit if all of the following criteria are satisfied:

A. The temporary use will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, nor injurious to property or improvements in the immediate vicinity. To this end, temporary tent encampments shall comply with the minimum standards set forth in PTMC 17.60.045;

B. The temporary use is compatible with the purpose and intent of this title, and the specific zoning district in which it will be located;

C. The temporary use is compatible in intensity and appearance with existing land uses in the immediate vicinity;

D. Structures proposed for the temporary use comply with the setback and clear vision area requirements of this title, and with applicable provisions of the building and fire codes;

E. Adequate parking is available to serve the temporary use, and, if applicable, the temporary use does not occupy required off-street parking facilities for adjacent or nearby uses;

F. Hours of operation of the temporary use are specified;

G. The temporary use will not cause noise, light, or glare which adversely impacts surrounding land uses; and

H. If applicable, the applicant has obtained approval of a street use agreement pursuant to Chapter 12.10 PTMC. (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.60.055 Event and temporary use permits – Chief of police authority.

In issuing any event permit or temporary use permits for use of the right-of-way or any public space, the chief of police (or designee), in consultation with the development services director and the public works director, is authorized to establish conditions and restrictions for the event to ensure public safety, including conditions that restrict others’ use of the area set aside for the event or use.

For example:

A. The chief could grant a permit holder the right to use portions of streets or sidewalks (subject to conditions to maintain public access and ensure safety). For example, a permit to a festival could allow the festival the authority to use certain sidewalks for event purposes (such as tables and booths) in the discretion of the permit holder, so long as minimum access standards set by the chief were maintained for safety of the public.

B. Chief could grant a permit for exclusive use of the sidewalk as part of an event. For example, a permit for an event at a building that also included outside activities could also include use of a defined area around the building (with conditions to ensure safety). (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016; Ord. 3091 § 2, 2014).


17.60.060 Time limitation.

A temporary use is valid for up to 180 calendar days from the effective date of the permit; however, the director of the development services department may establish a shorter time frame. The director may grant one extension not to exceed 60 days, upon the applicant showing compliance with all conditions of permit approval. (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.60.070 Limitation on activity.

A. A property owner or other holder of a temporary use permit may not file an application for a successive temporary use permit for 60 days following the expiration of an approved permit applying to that property.

B. Only one temporary tent encampment shall be located in the city at any time. (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.60.080 Required conditions.

The director of the development services department shall establish, as a condition of each temporary use permit:

A. A time within which the use and all physical evidence of the use must be removed.

B. If the applicant has not removed the use as required by the temporary use permit, the city may abate the use as provided in PTMC 17.60.090.

C. Applicant shall obtain a city business license, if applicable. (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.60.090 Abatement.

Prior to the approval of a temporary use permit, the applicant shall submit to the director of the development services department an irrevocable, signed and notarized statement granting the city permission to summarily enter the applicant’s property with reasonable notice and abate the temporary use, and all physical evidence of that use if it has not been removed as required by the terms of the permit. The statement shall also indicate that the applicant will reimburse the city for any expenses incurred in abating a temporary use under the authority of this chapter. (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.60.100 Assurance device.

In appropriate circumstances, the director of the development services department may require a reasonable performance of maintenance assurance device, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, to assure compliance with the provisions of this title and the temporary use permit as approved. (Ord. 3154 § 4(6) (Exh. H), 2016;  Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

17.68.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide regulations for fences, walls, arbors, hedges and other partially or totally sight-obscuring installations or features, to ensure the streetscape is enhanced from such installations, to assure that desirable objectives of providing privacy, security, and screening of properties can be met while limiting unsafe vision obstructions of motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians, and improving the visual qualities and appeal of the community consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 3042 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.68.020 Applicability.

These regulations shall apply to fences, walls, arbors, hedges and other partially or totally sight-obscuring installations or features within residential zoning districts. Please refer to the following definitions in Chapter 17.08 PTMC: “arbor”; “clear vision area”; “fence”; “natural grade”; “hedge”; “lot line”; “setback (yard requirements)”; and “wall.” (Ord. 3042 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.68.030 General requirements.

Fences, walls, arbors, hedges and other partially or totally sight-obscuring installations or features may be permitted within any required front, side, or rear setback area specified in Table 17.16.030, or along the edge of any yard; provided, that they meet the requirements below. Building permits may be required for fences over six feet in height or as adopted through the International Residential Code.

A. Not Permitted in Open or Unopened Public Street Rights-of-Way. No fence, wall, arbor, hedge or other partially or totally sight-obscuring installation or feature shall be allowed within any public right-of-way. Exceptions:

1. A right-of-way has been vacated by law.

2. Unless erected by a public entity for the purpose of security and/or public safety. 

B. Clear Vision Area. No fence, wall, arbor, hedge or other partially or totally sight-obscuring installation or feature over 30 inches in height which poses a traffic safety hazard shall be located within a clear vision area, defined as a 20-foot-by-20-foot sight triangle measured from the sidewalk, edge of pavement or rolling surface; see illustration below.


[IMAGE]


C. Maximum Heights. The following maximum heights do not apply to hedges or arbors but apply to fences, walls, and other sight-obscuring installations or features:

1. When within a setback abutting an open or unopened public street right-of-way, the maximum height of eight feet is subject to the following (see illustrations below): 

a. The maximum height that is up to 100 percent solid shall be four feet.

b. Any portion between four and six feet in height shall be no less than 50 percent open when viewed perpendicular to the property line. (Note: Standard lattice is only 25 percent open.)

c. Any portion between six and eight feet in height shall be no less than 90 percent open; posts, rails and other framing members are allowed as needed to secure materials such as wire, fine mesh, string or monofilament, but no barbed wire is allowed;

2. When within any rear or side setback not abutting an open or unopened public street right-of-way, the maximum height shall be eight feet;

3. When outside of the required setback area (i.e., toward the center of a lot) the maximum height shall be eight feet;

4. The burden shall rest upon the property owner to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director the lot line locations.

Allowed percentage of open construction per height of fence or wall


[IMAGE]


D. Arbors. Arbors are defined in PTMC 17.08.020 as any detached latticework or archway. Except as noted below, an arbor may not be attached to a fence or wall within the required setback area. No portion of an arbor shall exceed 10 feet in height. In addition, the side of any arbor that abuts the right-of-way or is within the setback abutting the right-of-way shall comply with the fence requirements for allowed percentage of open construction and height. Exception: one arbor per property side, used as an entrance or gate, is allowed as a portion of the fence.

E. Hedges. None of the height limits established in this chapter shall apply to hedges, including any closely planted trees or vegetation. However, hedges located in the clear vision area are subject to required maintenance including trimming and/or removal. Hedges shall be sufficiently set back at time of planting so that mature vegetation remains within private property and does not encroach into the public street right-of-way.

F. Maximum heights specified by this chapter shall be measured from the elevation of the natural grade within two feet of the installation on the lower side.

G. All fences and walls shall comply with the requirements of the International Residential Code, as adopted under Chapter 16.04 PTMC. However, it shall be up to the discretion of the building official whether a proposed 90 percent open wire fence up to eight feet tall constructed to the standards issued by the development services department requires a building permit, or is exempt from a building permit. Exemptions for fences and walls that do not require a building permit shall not be construed as relieving the owner of responsibility for maintenance and for compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any other law or ordinance regulating the same. (Ord. 3042 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 3035 § 10, 2010; Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.68.040 Prohibitions.

The following is prohibited within the city:

A. Any fence, wall, or other partially or totally sight-obscuring installations or features that have attached to it any barb, spike, broken glass or other pointed or sharp instrument. This prohibition shall not be construed to limit the placement of barbed wire fences less than six feet in height.

B. Any fence or wall in the rights-of-way; see exemptions in PTMC 17.68.030(A). (Ord. 3042 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.68.050 Potential safety hazards.

No fence, wall, arbor, hedge or other partially or totally sight-obscuring installation or feature over three feet in height shall be placed within five feet of any structure where such installation runs parallel with an outside wall and substantially interferes with access to such structure for fire and public safety purposes. (Ord. 3042 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

The purposes of this chapter are as follows:

A. To implement comprehensive plan parking management policies and strike a more appropriate balance between providing parking for automobiles and promoting alternative transportation modes (e.g., transit, walking and bicycles);

B. To promote economic development and historic preservation through more efficient land use, infill development, and adaptive reuse and renovation within the city’s historic overlay district, as defined in PTMC 17.30.040;

C. To reduce the creation of new impervious surfaces through lower required parking ratios, establishment of maximum parking limits and shared parking facilities;

D. To reduce traffic congestion and hazards;

E. To provide accessible, attractive, well-maintained and screened off-street parking facilities;

F. To provide aesthetically pleasing parking facilities in proportion to individual land use needs; and

G. To assure the maneuverability of emergency vehicles. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.020 Applicability and exemptions.

A. Applicability. Unless specifically exempted under subsections B or C of this section, every land use shall provide parking and loading areas in accordance with the following regulations whenever:

1. Any structure is constructed, erected, relocated or expanded; or

2. Any use is established, changed or relocated.

B. Exemption – National Register Historic Overlay District. All new construction and all land uses established, changed or relocated within the nonresidential zoning districts of the historic overlay district, as defined by PTMC 17.30.040, except for the C-III zoned portions of the Uptown National Landmark Historic District, shall be exempt from off-street parking and loading requirements; provided, that the owner of the property underlying such construction or uses has first signed a no protest agreement with the city, in a form approved by the city attorney, concerning the formation of a parking and business improvements district (PBID) for the purpose of funding municipal parking facilities, pursuant to Chapter 35.87A RCW; and further provided, that all such construction and uses shall be subject to the maximum permissible parking space and bicycle parking requirements set forth in Table 17.72.080; and provided further, if parking facilities are provided, they must meet the requirements established pursuant to PTMC 17.72.150 through 17.72.190 regarding parking plan requirements, minimum dimensions, landscaping, and maintenance.

C. Exemption – Upper Floors of Commercial and Mixed Use Buildings. All new construction and all land uses established, changed or relocated on floors above the ground floor within the C-I, C-II, C-II(H), C-I/MU and C-II/MU zoning districts shall be exempt from off-street parking and loading requirements; provided, that all such construction and uses shall be subject to the bicycle parking requirements set forth in Table 17.72.080; and provided further, if parking facilities are provided, they must meet the requirements established pursuant to PTMC 17.72.150 through 17.72.190 regarding parking plan requirements, minimum dimensions, landscaping, and maintenance. (Ord. 2996 § 1, 2009; Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. E), 2003; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.030 Off-street parking and loading requirements.

A. Where current or anticipated parking congestion warrants, requirements in addition to those provided in this title may be imposed by the decision-maker pursuant to a conditional use permit (Chapter 17.84 PTMC) or determination pursuant to PTMC Title 19.

B. Parking and loading requirements shall be developed to the plans and specifications provided and approved pursuant to PTMC 17.72.150.

C. The provision of off-street parking and loading in the manner and extent required in this chapter shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of a given building or use as long as the use is in existence. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing parking facilities for any other use; except as may be provided in PTMC 17.72.140, Joint use.

D. Except as otherwise provided herein, required parking areas shall be used for motor vehicle parking only, with no sales, storage, repair work or dismantling of any kind. Removal, discontinuance or reduction of such required parking and loading facilities from practical use by obstruction, erection of building, or other actions which reduce the parking or loading capacity or usefulness thereof is prohibited unless replacement facilities are established which meet the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that up to 10 percent of required parking areas which have at least 10 parking spaces may be used for solid waste recycling facilities. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.040 Existing off‑street parking facilities.

Unless otherwise provided by the decision-maker pursuant to a conditional use permit (Chapter 17.84 PTMC) or determination pursuant to PTMC Title 19, existing off-street parking facilities which serve existing uses which were established prior to August 17, 1971, shall be considered optional off-street parking, and may be removed or eliminated at the discretion of the owner without notice, penalty or obligation. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.050 Expansion.

Whenever any building is expanded in floor area, or whenever an outdoor use is expanded in activity area, off-street parking shall be provided for the uses to be established in such expansion in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.060 Change of use.

A. Whenever use of an existing building or portion is changed to a different use, off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that such requirement shall be reduced by the number of spaces required for the pre-existing use as if such pre-existing use had been established pursuant to this chapter. For example, if a 2,000-square-foot apparel and accessory store was to be replaced by a restaurant with four employees and seating for 24 patrons, the parking requirement would be computed as follows:

	Restaurant (2,000/1 space per each 2 employees, plus 1 each 6 seats) = 	6 spaces

	less pre-existing use requirement apparel and accessory store



	(2,000/400 sq. ft.) = 	5 spaces

	Required parking for new use = 	1 space

B. The reduction provided in subsection A of this section applies whether or not the preexisting use was established pursuant to this chapter.

C. In the event the building in which the new use is to be established is served by existing off-street parking facilities, the required parking for the new use shall be reduced by the number of existing off-street parking spaces which exceeds the required parking for the existing uses in the building.

D. For the purposes of this section, any use or portion thereof that has been discontinued for a period of three years or more shall not be considered a pre-existing use. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.070 Mixed occupancies.

In the case of two or more uses in the same building, the total off-street parking requirements for the various uses shall be the sum of the requirements for the principal uses computed separately. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.080 Table of vehicular and bicycle parking standards.

Unless otherwise provided in this title, the required number of off-street parking spaces shall be in conformance with Table 17.72.080. For purposes of this chapter, gross floor area shall not include elevator shafts, stairwells or mechanical equipment rooms. Where alternative requirements result in conflicting computations, the greater shall apply.

17.72.085 Maximum permitted parking.

Repealed by Ord. 2893. (Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. E), 2003).


17.72.090 Fractional spaces.

If the provisions of this chapter result in a parking requirement which includes a fractional parking space, any fraction less than one-half shall be disregarded, and fractions of one-half or greater shall require one parking space. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2,1997).


17.72.100 Uses not specified.

In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in this chapter, the requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be determined by the decision-maker based on similar uses for which requirements are specified. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.110 Location.

Off-street parking facilities shall be located as hereinafter specified; where a distance is specified, such distance shall be the walking distance measured along the shortest safe pedestrian way from the nearest point of the parking facility to the nearest entrance to the building which the facility is required to serve:

A. For single-family dwellings: not more than 200 feet;

B. For multifamily dwellings, boardinghouses, congregate care facilities, and tourist homes: not more than 100 feet;

C. For restaurants, retail commercial establishments, hospitals, sanitariums, convalescent homes: not more than 200 feet;

D. For bed and breakfast inns: not more than 200 feet; and

E. For uses other than those specified above: not more than 500 feet. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.120 On‑street parking spaces.

A. If the proposed parking area plan submitted pursuant to PTMC 17.72.170 would require elimination of one or more existing on-street parking spaces within the C-III zoning district, the parking requirements prescribed in PTMC 17.72.080 are increased by two off-street spaces for each on-street space to be eliminated; provided, that the building official may waive all or part of any such increase upon a showing to his/her satisfaction that one or more of the spaces to be eliminated had been created by permission of the applicant within the six years preceding the proposed building, use or expansion.

B. If, however, such parking area plan would restore one or more existing on-street parking spaces within the C-III zoning district by reducing existing curb cuts or other conflicts, the off-street parking requirements prescribed in PTMC 17.72.080 are reduced by two off-street parking spaces for each on-street parking space restored by said plan.

C. The required number of off-street parking spaces provided for commercial, mixed use, and multifamily residential properties outside the C-III historic commercial district that are being developed, redeveloped, or expanded shall be reduced by two spaces for each on-street parking space provided adjacent to a site. The design, placement, and proposed construction standard of on-street parking spaces will be reviewed and approved by the public works director. Due to the high level of traffic, on-street parking may not be possible along Sims Way or other streets as determined by public works.

D. On-street parking spaces may be used to meet ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) parking requirements if such a location meets ADA design standards and would better serve the public than off-street ADA parking. (Ord. 2920 § 8, 2005; Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. E), 2003; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.130 Residential transient accommodations – Parking requirements.

A bed and breakfast inn or a tourist home shall provide parking consistent with the requirements of Table 17.72.080; provided, that for a bed and breakfast inn in an historic structure as defined under Chapter 17.08 PTMC, the required number of off-street parking spaces shall be reduced by the number of on-street parking spaces which are located on that portion of the public street right-of-way which is abutting the front and side lot lines of the property. In such instances, one on-street parking space shall be counted for each continuous 20 feet of abutting street frontage, less the 20 closest to each street intersection and any frontage which may not be safely used for on-street parking due to the presence of driveways, hydrants or other conflicting uses. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.72.140 Joint use.

A. The decision-maker may authorize joint use of parking facilities required by this chapter through a joint use agreement between a use which requires parking primarily during the day (hereinafter, “daytime uses”) and a use which requires parking primarily during the night (hereinafter, “nighttime uses”). Daytime uses are such establishments as banks, offices, retail and personal service shops, clothing, furniture, manufacturing, or wholesale and related uses. Nighttime uses include theaters, auditoriums, bowling alleys, bars, restaurants, lodgings and related uses.

B. The portion of parking facilities serving retail stores selling groceries and related items may not be used for joint use parking.

C. No more than one joint use parking agreement may be applied to each portion of any parking facility.

D. The applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict between the principal operating hours of the building or uses for which joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed.

E. The applicant shall present a binding legal agreement, executed by the parties holding an ownership interest in the properties subject to the proposed joint use parking agreement. The agreement shall be irrevocable for the term of the proposed joint use parking and shall provide, that in the event that the joint use parking becomes unavailable, replacement off-street parking shall be provided or the use shall be discontinued. Such instrument, after approval as to form and manner of execution by the city attorney, shall be approved by the decision-maker, recorded with the county auditor, and filed with the building official. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

2. Provide visual separation and screening of parking areas from public streets, pedestrian areas and surrounding uses;

3. Preserve and protect existing significant trees;

4. Plant species that:

a. Fulfill the screening, shading and appearance purposes of the landscaping in all seasons;

b. Provide a desirable diversity of species;

c. Will be comparable in scale to surrounding existing and anticipated uses when plants reach maturity;

d. Are native to the regional environment or readily adaptable to local conditions;

e. Will not create particularly burdensome maintenance or damage problems such as large leaf debris, dripping sap, or pavement damage;

f. Will not require regular irrigation under normal local weather conditions after five years of growth;

5. Planting methods that follow accepted nursery standards and practices suited to the particular conditions of the site;

6. Provide for protection of trees from vehicular damage;

7. Provide a watering system to provide for adequate watering of the newly installed trees at the time of planting and through the dry periods (typically May through September) for a minimum of three years;

8. Planting areas shall be sized appropriately to allow proper plant growth and to protect shrubs and trees from vehicles.

a. Planting areas containing trees shall have a minimum width and depth of eight feet;

b. Other required planting areas shall have a minimum width and depth of five feet;

b. One tree for each 35 lineal feet of street frontage or fraction thereof, excluding driveways.

c. Each tree shall be healthy “balled and burlapped” stock and carefully planted in a planting area of at least 64 square feet, unless planted as a street tree within a sidewalk in accordance with city street tree planting standards.

d. Each required deciduous street shall measure a minimum of three-quarters of an inch in diameter at six inches above the ground level at time of planting.

e. Each required evergreen tree shall have a minimum height of eight feet at time of planting.

f. The remaining planting strip area shall be planted with shrubs and ground cover sufficient to provide substantial visual screening to a height of approximately four feet within three years.

g. Required shrubs shall be a minimum height of one and one-half feet at time of planting.

h. All property other than the required landscaped strip lying between the right-of-way and off-street parking area shall be landscaped with landscape bark, grass or other ground cover.

2. Perimeter landscaping abutting other properties: Off-street parking lots which will not be entirely screened visually by an intervening building or structure from abutting property shall provide landscaping between the parking lot and such abutting property in accordance with the following minimum requirements:

a. Where parking lots abut residentially zoned property, a wall, hedge, or other durable landscape barrier not less than five feet in height shall be placed to form a continuous visual screen between the parking lot and such abutting property. One of the following methods shall be used to provide such barrier:

i. Suitable hedge-type shrubs sized and planted to provide a solid screen to a height of five feet within three years of planting.

ii. Solid wood or shingle fencing a minimum five feet in height with shrubs planted in front a minimum of 10 feet on center to grow to at least five feet within five years of planting.

If such barrier consists all or in part of plant materials, such plant material shall be planted in a planting strip of not less than five feet in width. Where such parking lot abuts an existing hedge, wall or other durable landscaping barrier on abutting property, such barrier may be used to satisfy the requirements of this subsection; provided, that such existing barrier substantially meets the standards of this section and protection against vehicular encroachment is provided for hedges.

b. One tree shall be placed for each 50 lineal feet of such landscape barrier or fraction thereof, otherwise planted to the standards set forth for perimeter landscaping in subsection (D)(1) of this section.

E. Preservation of Significant Trees. 

1. The applicant shall retail all significant trees within the required perimeter landscaping strip, excluding those which will constitute a safety hazard. Within the interior of parking areas, at least 15 percent of healthy trees over 25 feet in height shall be preserved.

2. Up to 10 percent of the required parking spaces may be eliminated at the rate of one parking space for each additional significant tree preserved, provided such trees do not constitute a safety hazard.

3. For the purposes of this subsection, any healthy tree which has a trunk diameter of six inches or larger shall be considered a significant tree.

F. Alternate parking lot landscaping plans may be approved by the planning DSD director upon a showing to his/her satisfaction that:

1. Due to the physical characteristics of the site or those of abutting properties, strict adherence to the minimum standards set forth in subsection D of this section would be unsafe or unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this title or unreasonably burdensome upon the applicant; and

2. The alternative plan proposed would satisfy the performance standards set forth in subsection C of this section. (Ord. 2893 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2840 § 2(Exh. E), 2003; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997. Formerly 17.72.190).

17.76.010 Statement of purpose.

A. The city council finds that it is necessary to regulate signs in the city to help assure that Port Townsend is a safe and attractive place in which to live and to do business.

B. Measures taken in this chapter to achieve this purpose reflect the city council’s consideration of:

1. The vantage points of pedestrians, motorists, cyclists, visitors, residents, and occupants of homes, shops, other buildings, and real property;

2. Safety through care in placement, sizing and illumination of signs so as to avoid visual clutter, distraction or obstruction of vision of pedestrians and motorists, or obstruction of rights-of-way;

3. Communication between businesses, organizations and the general public;

4. Economy for those erecting signs, or maintaining or modifying already-existing signs, through care in specifying style and construction; by reducing the need to replace signs which might become obscured by unnecessarily large neighboring signs; by providing adequate time to replace signs which do not comply with the new standards; by protecting property values; and by preserving the community character which attracts visitors and new residents and sustains business development;

5. Aesthetic benefits to business districts and the community at large through consistency in style, placement, and scale and harmony of signs with buildings, natural settings and other signs;

6. Compatibility of signs with the architectural and historical qualities of Port Townsend;

7. General public health, safety and welfare; and

8. Fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations.

C. The people of Port Townsend are proud of its National Historic Landmark District. Our national government declared Fort Worden and the district as two of the few national historic landmarks in the state of Washington. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has assisted the city with a sign provision for the historic district. Specific guidelines for signs were included in the Field Report on the Water Street Historic District, National Trust for Historic Preservation, 1974. The city council finds that special sign regulations are required to preserve and reflect the historic character of the National Historic Landmark District.

D. The city council intends that to the fullest extent authorized by Chapter 47.24 RCW, now or as hereafter amended, the provisions of this chapter shall also govern within any street, bridge or wharf which also forms a part of any state highway in the city. In addition, the provisions of Chapter 47.42 RCW, the Highway Advertising Control Act-Scenic Vistas Act, now or as hereafter amended, shall not authorize erection of any sign contrary to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

Article II. Regulations


17.76.020 General provisions.

The following provisions shall apply to all zoning districts and to all signs regulated by this chapter, subject however to the specific regulations in each zoning district:

A. No sign shall be erected, caused to be erected, or allowed to remain erected except in compliance with all the regulations established in this chapter. No owner or lessee of any real property located within the corporate limits of the city shall knowingly allow any sign to be erected on any such property in violation of the provisions of this chapter. No person shall take any action intending to, or having the effect of, circumventing the purpose and intent of this chapter. Sign permits shall be required for all signs except those specifically exempt from permits (see Article III of this chapter).

B. Signs within the National Landmark Historic District subject to design review as provided in this title must obtain approval of the historic preservation committee before a sign permit may be issued. 

C. Safe and Secure Installation. As part of the sign permit application, monument and projecting signs shall require building plan review to assure that the signs, sign structures and bracing systems are designed and constructed to support the weight of the sign and the vertical and lateral forces which may occur from winds, snow or seismic activity. For signs on buildings these loads and forces shall be transmitted through the structural frame of the building in such a manner as not to overstress any of the elements of the building or sign structure. The working stresses of wire rope or its fastenings shall not exceed 25 percent of the ultimate strength of the rope or fasteners. Signs attached to masonry, concrete or steel shall be safely and securely fastened thereto with metal anchors, bolts or approved expansion screws of sufficient size and anchorage to safely support the loads applied. No wooden blocks or plugs or anchors with wood used in connection with the screws or nails shall be used, except in the case of signs attached to wood framing. Materials of construction for signs and sign structures shall be of the quality and grade as specified for buildings in the International Building Code as adopted in PTMC Title 16. All electrified signs shall be designed, installed and inspected in conformance with the National Electrical Code.

D. Sign Maintenance. All signs shall be constructed with materials and workmanship of high quality to avoid problems of deterioration and maintenance which would give rise to unsightly and unsafe conditions. It is the responsibility of the business to maintain the signage in good repair and function at all times. Signs in disrepair may be subject to enforcement and removal.

E. Clearance and Sight Distance. Marquees, canopy signs or projecting signs which project over areas where motor trucks may be required to pass beneath them shall maintain a minimum vertical clearance of 15 feet. No marquee, canopy sign or projecting sign shall project closer than two feet from the curb line of the street. All marquees, canopy signs and projecting signs must maintain a minimum of eight feet of vertical clearance over pedestrian ways. New freestanding and portable signs shall not be placed within a clear vision area at the intersection of any streets, alleys or driveways. This distance is typically 15 feet on either side of the intersection.

F. Light and Glare from Signs. The light source for externally illuminated signs shall be no farther away from the sign than the height of the sign and shall be downward-facing and shielded so that direct rays from the light do not spill over onto abutting properties or roadways or into the night sky. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

Where feasible and available, the MIS program may also allow pedestrians to obtain participant information via electronic means. The use of quick response (QR) codes is one current example of such means but others may become available and acceptable when determined so by the city. The city installs and maintains the sign and back map panel which are located primarily within public rights-of-way. Participants purchase an addressing strip from the city, who arranges for its engraving and installation on the MIS panel. The participant strip may, as space allows, contain a means to direct persons electronically (via, e.g., a QR code) to a participant’s website. The city may also use the MIS installations to provide notice of city-sanctioned events and information in either electronic or written format.

L. Signage on awnings shall only be permitted on the vertical faces. See the design guidelines for awnings in the adopted Historic Preservation Standards Manual referenced in PTMC 17.30.160.

17.76.085 Merchant information sign program.

The merchant information sign (MIS) program establishes a uniform off-premises signage program within public rights-of-way of the Port Townsend National Historic Landmark District (NHLD). The program is designed to direct pedestrians within the NHLD to various public and private locations. Each MIS panel consists of a NHLD map keyed to individual strips that contain a participant’s name and address. Additional information, such as a logo, can be permitted as space allows. Each MIS panel will allow up to eight individual participant strips. In addition to the provisions contained in this section, the DSD director is authorized to formulate and adopt procedures for administration of the MIS program.

A. Applicability. To be eligible for the MIS program, participants must meet the following criteria:

1. MIS participants may be any public, private or nonprofit entity with a physical location (i.e., address) within the NHLD. A participant may have one strip within the program. Preference is given to street level businesses on Water or Lawrence Street.

2. Participants will be given the chance to advertise on one MIS panel, however, inclusion is on a space available, first-come-first-served basis. If no space exists on a preferred MIS panel, then a qualified participant may request to be put on a waiting list for that panel. As participants leave the program (or a particular panel), the first entity on the waiting list queue will be given the chance to advertise on that MIS panel.

3. A seasonal business may participate, but must pay a fee for the MIS strip to be covered or removed by staff during the time the business is not in operation.

B. Standards. Signage shall be subject to the following standards:

1. The city installs and maintains the sign and back map panel. Participants purchase an addressing strip from the city, who arranges for its engraving and installation on the MIS panel.

2. The participant strip may, as space allows, contain a means to direct persons electronically (via, e.g., a QR code) to a participant’s website. The use of quick response (QR) codes is one current example of such means but others may become available and acceptable when determined so by the city. Any use of electronic means of communication must relate directly to an individual participant’s line of work and be approved by the city as part of the application process prior to installation.

3. The city may also use the MIS panels to provide notice of city-sanctioned events and information in either electronic or written format.

C. Application. A business or organization that meets the criteria identified in subsection A of this section may apply for participation in the MIS program by submitting the following materials:

1. A completed application on a form as prepared by the development services department.

2. The merchant information sign program is subject to re-evaluation and may be changed and/or removed through council action.

D. Review Process. The subject application shall be subject to a Type I review and appeal process. (Ord. 3097 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014).

17.76.113 Pilot project – Sims Way (SR20) local information signs. 

This pilot program evaluates the effectiveness of establishing a uniform off-premises signage program along Sims Way (SR20) for food and lodging businesses located within portions of commercially zoned land off Sims Way (SR20) between the Kearney Street and Haines Place intersections (referred to as the “lower Sims Way defined area or study area”), and along Sims Way for retail businesses located in the vicinity of Sherman and Sims and Howard and Sims (referred to as “the upper Sims Way defined area”). The pilot program will allow food and lodging businesses located within the lower Sims Way study area and retail-oriented businesses located within the upper Sims Way defined area to advertise on city-approved and installed off-premises signage within a section of lower Sims Way and upper Sims Way (SR20) as set forth in this section. The off-premises signs will be strategically placed along the road at an intersection or parallel street to alert travelers about the nearby food and lodging services available off lower Sims Way defined area and retail services off the upper Sims Way defined areas.  For lower Sims Way, local information signs (LIS) will be blue panels with directional arrows and individual business logos and/or names. A maximum of four business logo signs may be installed on each back panel of the two-sided LIS.  For upper Sims Way, local information signs (LIS) will be similar to the sign depicted in Attachment 2 to Ordinance No. 3064, Local Information Sign Plan. A maximum of four business logo signs may be installed on each sign.

A. Applicability. A business located off of Sims Way (SR20) on a side street or parallel street within the lower Sims Way study area between Kearney and Haines Place or the upper Sims Way defined area may apply for standardized signage on a city installed and maintained back panel; provided, that all of the following are met:

1. For lower Sims Way, the business is located within the designated program area as indicated on the Sims Way (SR20) local information sign project area map as adopted by city council. For upper Sims Way, the business is located within 250 feet of either the intersection of Sims and Howard or Sherman and Howard.

2. Repealed by Ord. 3064.

3. Only one sign shall be permitted per parcel, lot or site.

4. For lower Sims Way only, the business was identified as being eligible for participation in the program in the Sims Way (SR20) local information sign assessment and plan that was adopted by council, or circumstances have changed that would now allow the business to meet the evaluation criteria as identified in the Sims Way (SR20) local information sign assessment and plan.

B. Criteria. To participate in the coordinated signage program, a business must meet all of the following criteria:

1. The parcel, lot or site on which the subject business is located does not abut Sims Way (SR20). For upper Sims Way, the business is located within 250 feet of either the intersection of Sims and Howard or Sherman and Howard.

2. For lower Sims Way only, the main source of income for the business must be from food and/or lodging services. For upper Sims Way, the main source of income must be from retail-oriented services.

3. The subject business must have adequate unused sign area available to accommodate the additional sign area that would be provided by the new signage established through this program.

4. The program has a first-come, first-served policy. For lower Sims Way only, if an existing back panel is full, a qualified business wishing to join the program will be put on a waiting list. When a business leaves the program, the first business on the waiting list will be given the chance to join.

5. A seasonal business may participate, but must pay a fee for the sign to be covered or removed during the time the business is not in operation.

C. Standards. Signage shall be subject to the following standards:

1. The location of signage permitted by this program within the Sims Way (SR20) right-of-way shall be determined by the city.

2. Participation in this program does not establish any opportunity for the participating business to maintain signage within the right-of-way except as provided by the program.

3. The city reserves the right to modify or terminate the program. The city reserves the right to relocate and/or remove any and all signage established through this section should its relocation and/or removal be warranted to accommodate an identified public need. Sign removal and/or relocation shall not be compensable to the business.

4. Signage established consistent with this program shall be associated with a specific business and not a building. Businesses in a multiple-business complex such as Port Townsend Business Park shall not be allowed to participate individually. Should a business that is participating in the program close or relocate, the signage provided through the program shall be removed. Subsequent businesses that occupy the same space may reapply for participation in the program if they meet the criteria contained in subsection A of this section. 

D. Application. A business that meets the criteria identified in subsection A of this section may apply for inclusion in the program by submitting the following materials:

1. A completed application on a form as prepared by the development services department.

2. A scaled drawing of the proposed logo sign prepared by a licensed sign maker consistent with the size and materials standards contained in the Sims Way (SR20) local information sign assessment and plan. 

3. A signed letter of agreement between the business and the city prepared in a standardized format as approved by the city attorney. 

4. The annual fee will be based on the actual cost to the city for constructing the local information signs. All businesses will be required to provide two business logos, one for each direction of travel, if there is space on the back panel to do so. The business is responsible to pay the sign maker for the cost of the finished logo sign.

E. Review Process. The subject application shall be subject to a Type I review and appeal process. (Ord. 3064 § 1 (Att. 1), 2011; Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.76.117 Upper Sims Way (SR20) coordinated signage program.

A. Applicability. A business located within the Upper Sims Way project area that fronts on Sims Way (SR20) may apply for use of city-provided standardized signage that is located within the Sims Way (SR20) right-of-way; provided, that all of the following are met:

1. The business is located within the designated portions of the Upper Sims Way project area as indicated on the Upper Sims Way project area map as adopted by the council.



2. The parcel, lot or site on which the subject business is located does not have another active business that was previously approved for participation in the program; only one sign shall be permitted per parcel, lot or site.

3. The business was identified as being eligible for participation in the program in the Upper Sims Way signage assessment and plan that was adopted by the city council, or circumstances have changed that would now allow the business to meet the evaluation criteria as identified in the Upper Sims Way signage assessment and plan.

B. Criteria. To participate in the coordinated signage program, a business must meet all of the following criteria:

1. The identification sign which is or could best be oriented to traffic for the subject business must be blocked by vegetation or structures when viewed from the adjacent street travel lane centerline at a distance of 210 feet per legibility model A as established in the Upper Sims Way signage assessment and plan.

2. Signs that are visible from greater distances shall not qualify for participation in the program.

3. Signs that are not visible from the opposing traffic lane shall not qualify for participation in the program.

4. The subject business must have adequate unused sign area available to accommodate the additional sign area which would be provided by the new signage established through this program.

C. Standards. Signage shall be subject to the following standards:

1. The location of signage permitted by this program within the Sims Way (SR20) right-of-way shall be determined by the city.

2. Participation in this program does not establish any opportunity for the participating business to maintain signage within the right-of-way except as provided by the program.

3. Redevelopment of the site or building housing the business will require reassessment of applicability to participate in this program.

4. The city reserves the right to modify or terminate the program. The city reserves the right to relocate and/or remove any and all signage established through this section should its relocation and/or removal be warranted to accommodate an identified public need. Sign removal and/or relocation shall not be compensable to the business.

5. Signage established consistent with this program shall be associated with a specific business and not a building. Should a business that is participating in the program close or relocate, the signage provided through the program shall be removed. Subsequent businesses that occupy the same space may reapply for participation in the program if they meet the criteria contained in subsection A of this section. 

6. Lighting of signage established through this section may be provided by the applicant at their expense; provided, that it is established consistent with the specifications for exterior lighting contained in the Upper Sims Way signage assessment and plan and has been reviewed and approved by the city.

D. Application. A business that meets the criteria identified in subsection A of this section may apply for inclusion in the program by submitting the following materials:

1. A completed application on a form as prepared by the development services department.

2. A scaled drawing of the proposed sign face prepared consistent with the size and materials standards contained in the Upper Sims Way signage assessment and plan.

3. A signed letter of agreement between the business and the city prepared in a standardized format as approved by the city attorney. 

4. No fee is required for this application.

E. Review Process. The subject application shall be subject to a Type I review and appeal process. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article VII. Administration and Enforcement


17.76.160 Variance.

The director shall have the authority to grant a variance from the requirements of this chapter in accordance with the following procedures and considerations:

A. The person seeking a variance shall prepare and submit an application on forms provided by the director accompanied by a fee specified by Chapter 20.09 PTMC.

B. Upon receipt of an application, the director shall first review the application for completeness. If the application is incomplete, the director shall promptly return it to the applicant and indicate the additional information needed to make the application complete.

C. Within 15 days of receipt of a complete application, the director shall make a preliminary determination of whether to grant the application, grant the same under specified conditions, or deny the variance. In making his/her determination, the director may grant a variance only upon specific, written findings of fact setting forth and showing that the following conditions exist:

1. Literal interpretation and strict application of the provisions and requirements of this chapter would cause either:

a. Undue hardship on the applicant because of unique or unusual conditions pertaining to the subject property; or

b. Loss or substantial modification of a sign which has been found by the historic preservation committee to contribute significantly to the National Historic Landmark District;

2. The unique or unusual conditions do not result from actions of the applicant or owner of the subject property;

3. Granting the variance would not confer a special privilege to the subject property that is denied to other similarly situated properties;

4. Granting the variance would not be materially detrimental to the property owners in the vicinity or to the traveling public;

5. Granting the variance would not be contrary to the objects of this chapter relating to the placement of signs and the reduction of clutter; and

6. Granting the variance would be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and would not establish a precedent for subsequent variance requests which could diminish the effect of this chapter in furthering these purposes.

D. In granting any variance, the director may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed sign as he/she may deem necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter in the public interest.

E. Within five days of making his/her preliminary determination, the director shall cause to be mailed a notice of the determination to the owner or reputed owner of the properties within 200 feet of the subject property, as shown by the property tax records of the Jefferson County assessor, and by posting notice in a conspicuous place on the subject property and at the Port Townsend City Hall. The applicant shall provide the list, prepared by a licensed title company, of tax parcels and their owners, with said owners’ names and addresses placed on labels suitable for mailing. The notice shall identify the applicant, the street address or legal description of the subject property, the variance requested, the director’s preliminary determination and where the application and director’s findings may be inspected, and shall indicate that written comments or objections will be received and considered by the director for a period of 10 days following the date of mailing.

F. Within five days of expiration of the comment period, the director shall consider any comments or objections made and render a final decision. The director shall cause to be mailed notice of his/her final decision to the applicant and to each person from whom written comments or objections to the preliminary determination have been received. Such decision shall be final and binding unless appealed in writing to the hearing examiner within 15 days of the date of mailing of the director’s final decision. Any person may file such an appeal by completing an appeals application accompanied by an appeal filing fee specified by Chapter 20.09 PTMC.

G. In the event of an appeal, the hearing examiner will review the reasons and information set forth in the letter of appeal, the findings, conclusions, and decision of the director, together with any written material submitted by the director, and may take public comment. The hearing examiner shall affirm the decision of the director unless s/he finds the decision to be clearly erroneous, or arbitrary and capricious, or contrary to law, in which case the hearing examiner may modify the decision or any conditions in connection therewith, or remand the same to the director.

H. No action to set aside or modify the decision of the hearing examiner may be brought in any court or other tribunal unless the action shall be filed within 30 days of the effective date of the decision. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997. Formerly 17.76.150). 


17.76.165 Sign standard departures.

A. A “departure” is a written request by the applicant to exceed a particular standard or group of standards through the use of techniques or approaches not otherwise permitted in this chapter.

B. Departures from the standards contained in this chapter may be permitted for:

1. On-premises signage in commercial, mixed use, public and manufacturing districts if approved as part of the design review process (if applicable), or administratively (if the signage is not subject to design review). 

2. Off-premises directional signage for:

a. Allowed seasonal agricultural uses located in residential zoning districts.

b. Public uses, not-for-profit community groups and events and other similar uses.

c. Conditionally approved uses in residential districts if approved as part of the conditional use process. Home occupations and other uses that are permitted outright in residential districts may not apply for a departure.

C. On-Premises Signage Departures – Applicability. Through the review process established by this section, sign departures may be allowed from the following sign standards:

1. Sign location;

2. Sign size; provided, that the proposed increase in signage is proportionate to the size of the subject building(s). In no case should increased signage for any building exceed 130 percent of the maximum allowable square footage as established for the building(s) through strict application of this chapter;

3. Sign height, excepting that pole signage shall not be permitted;

4. Number of signs;

5. Amount of internally or externally illuminated signage.

D. On-Premises Signage Departures – Standards. In order for a departure from on-premises sign standards to be allowed, the applicant must demonstrate that:

1. The proposal would better serve the public interest as defined by the city’s comprehensive plan, its implementing regulations and other adopted plans and policies than a strict application of the standards contained in this chapter.

2. The proposal is more innovative and appropriate for the site and/or use than that allowed by the adopted standards.

3. The proposal exceeds the intent of the respective sign standard(s) as compared to a strict application of the established standard(s).

E. On-Premises Signage Departures – Process. The director shall review the application and shall make the final decision. In the following situations, the director shall first receive the recommendation of the applicable advisory committee as follows:

1. The historic preservation committee for businesses or commercial uses in the National Historic Landmark District, or signs proposed for location in the National Historic Landmark District.

2. Commercial design review advisory committee for sign departures for businesses or uses outside the National Historic Landmark District, where the business or use is subject to commercial design review per Chapters 17.44 and 17.46 PTMC.

The advisory committee may make their recommendation on a simple majority of the members present. The director may deny a departure if he or she concludes that such departure does not meet the criteria as specified above. A director’s decision is appealable according to the procedures governing Type 1-A permits. 

F. Off-Premises Signage Departures – Applicability. Through the review process established by this section, off-premises directional sign departures may be allowed for: 

1. Directional signage for allowed seasonal agricultural uses located in residential zoning districts;

2. Public uses, not-for-profit community groups and events and other similar uses; 

3. Uses allowed conditionally within residential districts when proposed and approved with the conditional use permit. Previously approved conditional uses in residential districts may apply for off-premises directional signage through a modification of their conditional use permit as permitted by PTMC 17.84.110.

G. Off-Premises Directional Signage Departures – Standards. Provided an off-premises signage plan is submitted, signs located other than at the site of the business or site may be approved if the following criteria are met: 

1. Off-premises signage for seasonal agricultural uses located in residential zoning districts and uses allowed conditionally within residential districts when proposed and approved with the conditional use permit:

a. The subject use is located significantly away from developed commercial districts, such that, without the sign(s), residents and visitors would likely be unaware of the existence of the use;

b. The subject use is not located in an area characterized by a regular and fully developed street grid;

c. It is difficult to locate the subject use due to the complexity and length of roads that provide access to the site;

d. The proposed off-premises sign(s) are the minimum necessary to provide directional guidance to the street fronting the subject use.

2. Off-premises signage for public uses, not-for-profit community groups and events, and other similar uses:

a. Off-premises signage shall be limited to no more than seven off-premises signs, which may be located at major intersections within two miles of the subject use.

H. Off-Premises Signage Plan – Contents. An off-premises signage plan contains the following:

1. Existing on-premises signage:

a. Sign type and quantity;

b. Sign area (square feet) for each sign and total area of all on-site signage;

c. Sign location (on a scaled site plan).

2. Proposed off-premises signage:

a. Sign type (include a scaled drawing of each proposed off-premises sign);

b. Sign area (square feet) for each proposed off-premises sign and total area of all off-premises signs;

c. Proposed off-site sign location(s) on a scaled map. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


17.76.170 Interpretations.

Where there is any dispute concerning the interpretation of this chapter, the decision of the director shall prevail, subject to the appeal provisions set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997. Formerly 17.76.160).


17.76.180 Enforcing official – Powers and duties.

He or she shall give at least 30 days’ notice in writing to the owner of such sign, or of the building, structure or premises on which such sign is located, to remove the sign or to bring it into compliance with this chapter. The director may order removal of the sign at the expense of the owner of the premises if compliance with the written order is not obtained. Notice to the owner shall be deemed to be given as of the date of deposit in the United States mail addressed to the address on record that date at the office of the Jefferson County assessor. Exception: In the case of temporary signs, banner signs, portable signs or streamers, only five days’ notice need be given.

C. The director may cause any sign which is erected or displayed in violation of this chapter to be summarily removed without notice and at the expense of the owner of the sign and/or premises if:

1. The condition or placement of the sign presents in the opinion of the director an immediate threat to the safety of the public; or

2. The sign is placed in the public right-of-way or upon city property or attached to a utility pole, tree or traffic sign in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997. Formerly 17.76.180).


17.76.200 Nonconforming signs.

A. Nonconforming signs shall be removed or brought into compliance with this chapter no later than the expiration of the amortization period of each such sign, determined as follows:

1. For signs made nonconforming by passage of Ordinance 2039, July 31, 1997;

2. For signs made nonconforming by the passage of Ordinance 3012, September 7, 2010;

3. Preexisting sandwich board signs legally established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, September 12, 2010, shall be considered legal nonconforming six years after the effective date of said ordinance.

B. Exception Pertaining to Certain Flashing, Blinking or Revolving Signs. Insofar as any sign or parts thereof flash, blink, move, or revolve in a manner prohibited by PTMC 17.76.070, such nonconformity shall be terminated no later than 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Otherwise, such other nonconforming conditions of such sign are subject to the provisions of this section pertaining to nonconforming signs.

C. Loss of Nonconforming Status.

1. A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal, nonconforming status if:

a. The sign is altered in any way in structure, color or copy, except for readerboard signs; or

b. The sign is damaged in excess of 50 percent of the original cost of the sign; or

c. The sign is relocated; or

d. The sign is replaced.

2. On the occurrence of any of the events described in subsection (C)(1) of this section, the sign shall be immediately brought into compliance with this chapter with a new permit secured therefor, or shall be removed; provided, however, that the director may authorize specific alterations of such nonconforming signs if s/he finds that:

a. The end of the nonconforming sign’s amortization period is more than two years away; and

b. The total amount of aggregate noncompliance of the sign area of the existing signs on the premises is reduced at least 50 percent by the proposed alterations; and

D. Notice of Nonconforming Signs. The director shall endeavor to give notice of the legal nonconformance and amortization periods set forth in this section to the owners of signs required to be removed. Such notice should be given to the owners of the signs as shown by city records within 60 days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or of the ordinance which renders the signs nonconforming, whichever occurs later. Only one such notice need be given. Failure of the director to give the notice specified in this section, or failure of the sign owner to receive any such notice, shall not limit or affect the city’s power to enforce this chapter, or in any way reduce the ability of the city to require removal of the nonconforming signs as provided by law.

E. Administrative Appeal. The owner of a nonconforming sign may appeal to the director to request an extended period of use of such sign beyond the amortization period determined by this section. Any such appeal must be made to the director upon forms provided by the city and must be accompanied by an appeal filing fee in the amount specified in Chapter 20.09 PTMC. The director shall require that the appellant provide as part of his/her appeal a general description of the sign, its dimensions and physical position; evidence sufficient to establish the date and cost of the sign as originally constructed and installed; the amount of depreciation claimed and the depreciation schedule used for such sign as reflected by Internal Revenue Service schedules for prior years; the estimated cost of relocation or alteration of such sign, where applicable; together with any other information or documents specified by the director which are reasonably necessary to assist the city in making a determination on the appeal. The director shall consider the statements and documentary evidence contained in the application and any supplementary information which s/he may reasonably require. In addition, s/he shall inspect the subject sign to determine its general condition, state of repair, and the extent to which the sign does not conform to the requirements and limitations of the ordinance codified in this chapter. In making his/her determination, the director shall consider the unrecoverable cost invested in the sign, the estimated remaining life of the sign and the degree of nonconformity. The director shall prepare and make available for public inspection the specific method s/he intends to use in processing such appeals. All determinations of appeals made pursuant to this section shall be made in writing with specific findings of fact and conclusions in support of the decision. All such determinations of the director are subject to appeal as provided by Chapter 20.01 PTMC. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997. Formerly 17.76.190).


17.76.210 Liability.

This chapter shall not be constituted to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person owning, building, altering, constructing, or removing or moving any sign in the city for damages to anyone injured or damaged either in person or property by any defect or action in this chapter, nor shall the city or any agent thereof be held as assuming such liability by reason of permit or inspection authorized in this chapter or a certificate of inspection issued by the city or any of its agents. (Ord. 3012 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997. Formerly 17.76.200).

17.78.010 Purpose, policy, goals and interpretation.

A. Purpose. This chapter is designed to provide opportunities for the community to be served by personal wireless service facilities, consistent with the rights of personal wireless service providers as set forth in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 56; S. Rep. No. 104-23 (1995); H. Rep. No. 104-204 (1995), codified at 47 U.S.C. 332(c)), hereinafter referred to as the “Telecommunications Act” or “the Act,” while at the same time providing for an orderly development of the city and protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the city’s residents and property owners.

B. Policy – Preservation of the Character of City. In addition to serving the general purposes of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan and zoning code, a primary objective of this chapter is to preserve the existing visual and aesthetic character of the city and its neighborhoods, as well as to minimize noise impacts generated by personal wireless service facilities. Preserving the visual and aesthetic character of the city includes the protection of viewscapes, scenic resources, state and locally registered historic buildings and structures, and the unique rural and natural characteristics of many areas of the city. The visual and aesthetic character of the city is particularly critical in Port Townsend since the city derives much of its economic health due to its distinctive beauty and status as a historic Victorian seaport, federally recognized in the National Register of Historic Places. Preserving the character of the city also includes limiting the intrusion of noise, visual and aesthetic impacts associated with commercial uses into residential neighborhoods.

C. Intent and Interpretation. These standards are designed to comply with the Telecommunications Act. The provisions of this chapter shall not be interpreted to prohibit, or to have the effect of prohibiting, telecommunications or personal wireless services, television broadcast signals, multichannel multi-point distribution services or direct broadcast satellite services, or to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services. 

D. Inconsistencies with Other City Regulations. To the extent that any provision of this chapter directly conflicts with any other city ordinance, this chapter shall control. In all other regards, this chapter shall be construed consistently with all other city ordinances, regulations and functional plans.

E. Goals. The goals of this chapter shall be to: 

1. Establish development regulations consistent with and implementing the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan, as adopted in July of 1996 or later amended;

2. Provide locations for locating personal wireless service facilities;

3. Encourage the location of personal wireless service facilities at the preferred locations identified in this chapter;

4. Facilitate the provision of personal wireless service facilities and infrastructure to serve city residents or others when in the city;

5. Encourage the use of appropriate and new technology so as to minimize adverse environmental, noise, and visual impacts; 

6. Encourage the location of personal wireless service facilities upon existing structures in identified commercial, industrial, marine and public/infrastructure zoning districts in such a manner that, whenever feasible, the personal wireless service facilities are integrated, or appear to be integrated into the structure;

7. Establish standards for personal wireless service facilities to mitigate the visual and noise impacts associated with those facilities;

8. Preserve the unique residential character of the city, by disallowing the placement of personal wireless service facilities in residential zones, except for certain defined low power licensed and unlicensed facilities which would have no appreciable impact on residential neighborhoods;

9. Preserve the aesthetic character of the city by encouraging creative and cooperative approaches to locating wireless communication facilities so that such facilities will be compatible with their surroundings;

10. Where technologically feasible, encourage and facilitate co-location of antennas, support structures and related equipment for wireless communication providers, public service telecommunications, and emergency service telecommunications;

11. Require prompt removal of abandoned facilities;

12. Encourage the development of personal wireless service facilities on a competitively neutral basis; and

13. Require measurement of baseline noise and RF emissions at personal wireless service facilities, and monitoring of new installations to demonstrate compliance with this chapter and FCC standards. (Ord. 2700 § 29, 1999; Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.78.020 Scope and applicability – Exemptions.

A. Scope. This chapter applies to the location, placement, construction and modification of licensed or unlicensed personal wireless service facilities as defined in this chapter. In addition to any other required permits, all proposals to locate, place, construct or modify a personal wireless facility shall require a wireless permit as further set forth in this chapter; provided, however, that this chapter does not apply to personal wireless facilities located completely and entirely inside a building, as that term is defined in this chapter.

B. Exemptions. The following personal wireless service facilities are exempt from the provisions of this chapter:

1. Federal, state or local personal wireless facilities used for temporary emergency communications in the event of a disaster, emergency preparedness and public health or safety purposes;

2. Two-way communication transmitters used by fire, police, and emergency aid or ambulance services;

3. Citizen band radio transmitters and antennas or antennas operated by federally licensed amateur (“ham”) radio operators;

4. Unlicensed, low powered, wireless communication antennas designed for mounting onto a structure, other than a street pole, the size of which does not exceed that as defined in PTMC 17.08.040. In addition, this exemption does not apply to those unlicensed facilities that would be located on buildings, structures, or street poles subject to the jurisdiction of the city’s historic preservation committee (HPC). In such cases, the proposed unlicensed facility placement must receive a certificate of design review from the HPC prior to its installation; 

5. Emergency or routine repairs, reconstruction, or routine maintenance of previously approved facilities, or replacement of transmitters, antennas, or other components of previously approved facilities which do not create a change in visual impact or an increase in radio frequency emissions levels;

15. In addition, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) applies to all applications for personal wireless service facilities, and is administered by the FCC via procedures adopted at 47 C.F.R., Part 1, Sections 1301 et seq. The FCC requires that an environmental assessment (EA) be filed with the FCC prior to beginning operations for facilities to be located within any of the following: officially designated wilderness areas or wildlife preserves; situations which may affect listed threatened or endangered species or critical habitats; situations which may affect historical sites listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places; Indian religious sites; 100-year floodplains (as determined by FEMA); situations which may cause significant change in surface features, such as wetland fills, deforestation or water diversion; proposed use of high intensity white lights in residential neighborhoods; and radio-frequency radiation exposure in excess of FCC adopted guidelines. If at the time of application, any of these conditions are affected, the draft EA shall be submitted to the city before or during the comment period, and upon adoption the final EA shall be also be submitted to the city.

16. Permit applications for all other necessary city approvals (e.g., building permit, street and utility development permit, etc.) shall be submitted with the personal wireless services facility permit application. See PTMC 17.78.050(A). 

17. If requested by the DSD director, a map showing the viewshed of the facility, meaning all places that the facility can be seen from in any compass direction, with section drawings showing the vertical relationship between the facility and the viewshed. In addition or alternatively, the decisionmaker may require photographic views from significant points in the viewshed showing the existing appearance and photo simulations depicting the appearance after the proposed facility is installed.

18. A visual impact analysis may be required whenever the DSD director determines that such facility imposes a significant visual impact on viewscapes pursuant to its authority under SEPA and/or the requirements of this chapter. 

a. The impact analysis will be accomplished through the erection of a crane or similar devices within the proposed site used to simulate the proposed dimensions and height of the structure. 

b. Ten working days prior to the demonstration, the applicant shall notify the DSD and provide a courtesy informational notice to properties within 1,000 feet of the parcel (for monopoles and macro-facilities) and 300 feet (for mini-facilities and micro-facilities) upon which the visual compatibility test will be conducted. The potential impact shall be documented through the submittal of maps, photographs, photo-stimulation and other appropriate methods.

19. If requested by the DSD director, a landscape plan which identifies existing and proposed landscaping.

20. For all applications which propose to locate facilities anywhere other than a preferred location, a written opinion from an electronic/telecommunications engineer (or other professional consultant approved by the DSD) describing: what preferred locations are within the geographic service area; why siting at a preferred location is not possible under PTMC 17.78.080; what good faith efforts and measures were taken to secure a more preferred location; how and why such efforts were unsuccessful; and how and why the proposed location is essential to meet service demands for the geographic service area.

21. For all applications which do not propose co-location of facilities, a written opinion from an electronic/telecommunications engineer (or other professional consultant as approved by the DSD) that: there are no other viable antenna-support structures or mounted antenna arrays reasonably available within the area sought by the applicant; that any such existing facilities are not technologically suitable for use by the applicant; and that the additional location sought is necessary to provide adequate communication coverage for the applicant. This submittal shall reflect good faith and cooperation as further set forth in PTMC 17.78.070.

22. For facilities which are categorically excluded from routine environmental processing as set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.1306, the following uniform demonstration of RF compliance:

a. Submission of a uniform demonstration of compliance, consisting of a written statement signed by the personal wireless service provider, conforming to FCC rules on truthfulness of written statements, subscription and verification.

b. A statement that the proposed facility does or will comply with FCC radio frequency emission guidelines for both general population/uncontrolled exposures and occupational/controlled exposures as defined in the FCC rules.

c. A statement or explanation with supporting data as to how the personal wireless service provider determined that the transmitting facility will comply, e.g., by calculational methods, by computer simulations, by actual field measurements, etc. Actual values for predicted exposure should be provided to further support the statement. An exhaustive record of all possible exposure locations is not necessary, but, for example, the “worst case” exposure value in an accessible area could be mentioned as showing that no exposures would ever be greater than that level. Reference should be given to the actual FCC exposure limit or limits relevant for the particular transmitting site.

d. An explanation as to what, if any, restrictions on access to certain areas will be maintained to ensure compliance with the public or occupational exposure limits. This includes control procedures that are established for workers who may be exposed as a result of maintenance or other tasks related to their jobs. 

e. A statement as to whether other significant transmitting sources are located at or near the transmitting site, and, if required by the FCC rules, whether their RF emissions were considered in determining compliance at the transmitting site.

23. For facilities that are not categorically excluded from routine RF emissions evaluation by the FCC or are environmental actions requiring the submission of an environmental assessment, the applicant shall submit any and all documents related to RF emissions, including but not limited to the draft environmental assessment or evaluation, submitted to the FCC as part of the licensing process.

24. Information necessary to determine whether the facilities are potentially categorically exempt under WAC 197-11-800(27).

B. Cost of Submittals. All application requirements shall be at the applicant’s own expense. In addition, for all reports, statements or opinions required under subsections (A)(10), (13), (20), (21), (22) and (23) of this section, at the request of the DSD director, the city may require independent third-party review (by a city-approved qualified technical consultant) to validate and review the technical information contained in the application submittals. This independent third party review may be required at the time of application submittal or later during the permitting process based on requests made by citizens or city land use decisionmakers. The cost of such review shall be borne by the applicant. All applications shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee as further set forth in Chapter 20.09 PTMC. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999).


17.78.050 Compliance with other regulations – Response capability.

A. Compliance with other Regulations. All construction of personal wireless service facilities shall also be subject to the requirements of the city’s building code, PTMC Title 16, and all codes adopted by reference in Chapter 16.04 PTMC, including but not limited to the International Building Code, the Electrical Code (NEC), the requirements of the National Electronics Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association (EIA/TIA) 222 Revision F Standard entitled “Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures” and any additional applicable standards published by the Electronics Industries Association, the International Fire Code and the right-of-way requirements of PTMC Title 12, including the engineering design standards. All necessary permit applications (e.g., building permit, street and utility development permit, etc.) shall be submitted with the personal wireless services facility permit. 

B. Business License Required. All personal wireless services facility’s providers must also obtain a business license pursuant to Chapter 5.08 PTMC. 

C. Emergency Response System. All personal wireless facilities service providers shall ensure that they are tied into the local emergency response system, and are responsible for determining whether the emergency 911 system or another emergency response system is most appropriate.

D. Right-of-Way Facilities. All facilities located in any developed or undeveloped street or right-of-way shall be governed by PTMC Title 12 and by any right-of-way utility requirements contained in PTMC 5.14.080, 5.14.100, 5.14.110, and 5.14.120, Port Townsend master cable television ordinance, deemed applicable by the DSD director or public works director. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999).


17.78.060 Prohibited facilities and locations.

A. Lattice and Guyed Towers Prohibited. Lattice and guyed towers shall not be permitted in any zoning district. Monopoles shall be permitted only as specified in this chapter.

B. Location in ESAs. Siting of personal wireless service facilities in environmentally sensitive areas shall be governed by Chapter 19.05, Critical Areas, except that the siting of such facilities shall be prohibited within regulated Class I, II or III wetlands.

C. Location in Residential Zoning Districts. Except as provided in PTMC 17.78.100(D), location of personal wireless service facilities shall not be permitted in any of the following residential zoning districts: R-I(SF), R-II(SF), R-III(MF) and R-IV(MF). In addition, except as provided in PTMC 17.78.100(D) and at the water tower preferred site, location of personal wireless service facilities shall not be permitted within 100 feet of these same residential zoning districts, measured from the edge of the proposed facility (e.g., the outside edge of the equipment enclosure, mount, antenna, etc., whichever is the farthest out) to the nearest residentially zoned property line (rather than to the center of the street which is typically the edge of the zoning district).

D. Neighborhood Commercial Zones. Personal wireless service facilities shall not be permitted in C-I, neighborhood commercial, C-I/MU neighborhood serving mixed use center, or C-II/MU community serving mixed use center zones, except for micro-facilities in developed streets.

E. Location in P/OS Zone. Except for the portion of the city water tower site which is a preferred location, the location of personal wireless service facilities in the P/OS, existing park or open space zone shall not be permitted. (Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999).


17.78.070 Overview of location preferences – Co-location.

A. Overview – Location Preferences. Certain areas of the city are more appropriate for the location of personal wireless service facilities because of the existing development in the area or on the site, the types of buildings already existing at the site, the existence of similar or compatible facilities at the particular site, the commercial or industrial nature of the area, the zoning designation of the area, and/or the technical suitability of the particular site. Locating facilities in such areas can reduce adverse visual and aesthetic impacts of personal wireless service facilities city-wide, and help protect the health, safety and welfare of city residents. 

Therefore, the location preferences and design criteria and guidelines, and associated conditions of approval, contained in this chapter are intended to ameliorate any potential visual, aesthetic or neighborhood livability concerns while still facilitating growth of an industry that is important to the city’s economic health and whose services are demanded by an increasing number of the city’s residents, businesses, workers and visitors. In order to facilitate the location of facilities at such preferred locations, the permitting process is intended to be simpler and more expeditious than for secondary locations. Preferred location permits will be processed as a Type II administrative permit, with notice, and are appealable to the hearing examiner, as more fully set forth in PTMC 17.78.100 and Chapter 20.01 PTMC. 

B. Co-location Encouraged. It is also the policy of the city of Port Townsend to minimize the number of personal wireless service support structures and require co-location when appropriate. The city will pursue all reasonable strategies to promote co-location of facilities, including emergency service facilities.

1. Co-location Requirements. Licensed carriers shall share personal wireless service facilities, structures and/or sites where such facilities are already located whenever feasible, so as to reduce the number of personal wireless facilities that are stand-alone facilities. All freestanding mounts shall be designed so as not to preclude co-location. All antenna-support structures shall be available for use by the owner or initial user thereof, together with as many other wireless communication service providers as can be technically accommodated.

2. Cooperation and Good Faith Among Carriers Required. All wireless communication service providers shall cooperate with other personal wireless service providers in co-locating additional antennas on existing monopole towers, antenna-support structures, and/or on existing buildings or other alternative antenna-support structures. A personal wireless service provider shall exercise good faith in co-locating with other providers and sharing antenna sites; provided, that such shared use does not give rise to a substantial technical impairment of the ability to provide service. Such good faith shall include sharing of nonproprietary technical information to evaluate the feasibility of co-location. This covenant of good faith and fair dealing shall be a condition of any permit issued under this chapter. In the event that a dispute arises as to whether a provider has exercised good faith in accommodating other providers, the city may require a third-party technical study at the expense of either or both of such providers. (Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999).


17.78.080 Preferred locations table.

The following table identifies areas, locations and/or zoning districts which constitute preferred locations for the siting of personal wireless service facilities, and the types of facilities which may be allowed at the preferred location.

(Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999).


17.78.090 Secondary locations table.

For the geographic areas of the city not covered by PTMC 17.78.060 and 17.78.080, the type of review process and facilities allowed will depend on the nature and characteristics of the various zoning districts in the city. The following table sets forth the type of facilities and the permit process for the various zoning districts in the city (excluding any area of the zone which is identified as a preferred location above):

	Zoning District	Types of Facilities	Type of Permit

	P-I public/infrastructure	Mini-facilities

Micro-facilities	Type III/CUP

Type II1

	C-II general commercial east of Sheridan Street	Macro- and mini-facilities

Micro-facilities 	Type III/CUP 

Type II1

	M-II (B) (Point Hudson) marine related uses	Mini-facilities and micro-facilities	Type III/CUP; also subject to HPC review per Chapters 17.30 and 17.80 PTMC.

	C-II(H) hospital commercial	Mini-facilities

	C-II/MU community serving mixed use center	Micro-facilities in developed streets	Type II1

	C-I neighborhood commercial	Micro-facilities in developed streets	Type II1

	1Notwithstanding the above, if a micro-facility subject to a Type II permitting process requires routine evaluation under FCC RF exposure guidelines, it shall be subject to a Type III/CUP permitting process. Under FCC guidelines (OET Bulletin 65, Ed. 97-01) in effect as of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, evaluation under the FCC’s environmental rules is required when tower-mounted antennas are mounted lower than 10 meters above ground and the total power of all channels being used is over 1,000 watts effective radiated power (ERP), or 2,000 W ERP for broadband PCS. The standards for micro-facilities encompasses this guideline as it now exists or is later amended. 

(Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999).


17.78.100 Review process – Preferred locations – Secondary locations – Low powered facilities – Variances.

A. General Provisions.

1. Comments. The DSD director may solicit comments from the public works director, building official, local utility providers, adjacent jurisdictions if the proposal is within one mile of another city or jurisdiction, the Washington State Department of Transportation (if the proposal is adjacent to a state highway), and any other state, local or federal officials as necessary.

2. Findings and Conclusions. Based upon comments from city departments and applicable agencies and all other pertinent information in the record, the decisionmaker shall make written findings and conclusions documenting compliance with all approval criteria. Approval and design criteria are found in PTMC 17.78.110 through 17.78.120. Required conditions of approval are contained in PTMC 17.78.130.

An application for the siting of personal wireless service facilities in a preferred location shall be processed according to the procedures for Type II land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures, as an administrative permit with notice and appealable to the hearing examiner, except as follows. The notice of application and notice of an appeal of a Type II action shall be mailed to the latest recorded real property owners as shown by the records of the county assessor within at least 1,000 feet (for monopoles and macro-facilities) or 300 feet (for mini-facilities and micro-facilities) of the boundary of the property upon which the development is proposed.

C. Secondary Locations – Additional Notice Required. An application for personal wireless service facilities siting shall be processed according to the criteria for the particular type of permit set forth in PTMC 17.78.090 through this section and as provided in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administration Procedures. The decisionmaker on Type II permits will be the DSD director. The decisionmaker on Type III/conditional use permits will be the hearing examiner due to the special expertise involved in these applications. Type III/conditional use permits, will also be subject to the review criteria set forth in Chapter 17.84 PTMC, Conditional Uses, and the design review and approval criteria set in PTMC 17.78.110 through 17.78.120. In addition, for all permits requiring public notice, the notice of application and notice of public hearing shall be mailed to the latest recorded real property owners as shown by the records of the county assessor within at least 1,000 feet (for monopoles and macro-facilities) or 300 feet (for mini-facilities or micro-facilities) of the boundary of the property upon which the development is proposed.

D. Low Power Licensed and Unlicensed Facilities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, low power licensed and unlicensed facilities mounted on street poles in developed street rights-of-way may be permitted in all zoning districts (including residential) and processed as Type I, administrative review process, pursuant to Chapter 20.01 PTMC; provided, however, that such facilities remain subject to any franchising or licensing fees established by the city council. Low power licensed and unlicensed personal wireless service facilities are defined as facilities with a maximum transmitter peak output power that does not exceed the limits for such as set forth by the Federal Communications Commission. Other than the antenna, all associated equipment for low powered facilities must be less than 14 by 16 inches in length and width and eight inches in depth. Low powered facility antennas have a length not to exceed 30 inches, a width not to exceed five inches and a depth not to exceed four inches.

1. Low Power Licensed and Unlicensed Facilities on New Street Poles. The placement of low power licensed or unlicensed facilities on new street poles in developed street rights-of-way shall be processed as a Type II administrative review process, pursuant to Chapter 20.01 PTMC, with mailed notice to adjacent property owners within 1,000 feet of the proposal. 

E. Historic Preservation Committee Review. No personal wireless service facility, including those exempted pursuant to PTMC 17.78.020(B)(4), that is proposed to be located on buildings, structures, or street poles subject to the jurisdiction of the city’s historic preservation committee (HPC) pursuant to Chapters 2.72, 17.30 and 17.80 PTMC, shall be placed or put into service unless a certificate of design review has been issued by the HPC and all other city permits or approvals for such an activity have been obtained.

F. Variance Procedure. Any applicant may request that the requirements established by this chapter be modified. Such request shall be processed according to the procedures for variances in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, and shall satisfy the criteria of Chapter 17.86 PTMC, Variances. In addition to the approval criteria of PTMC 17.86.050, in granting any variance the decisionmaker must also find that: (1) there are no increased noise, aesthetic or safety impacts on adjoining properties as a result of the proposed variance; and (2) in the case of a historic building or structure, the variance will continue to allow for effective concealment, disguise or camouflaging of the facilities. The decisionmaker shall not grant a variance from the provisions of this chapter which establish the allowed, conditional and prohibited uses within the various zoning districts. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2779 § 2, 2001; Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.78.110 Design criteria and standards for monopoles and macro-facilities, mini-facilities and micro-facilities.

In its review of a proposed personal wireless facility, including associated equipment cabinets and security barriers, the decisionmaker shall be guided by the following standards:

A. Location, Camouflage, and Concealment. The entire facility should blend with and not disturb the visual character of its setting, and camouflaging, concealment and/or disguising the facilities may be required depending on the circumstances. To the greatest extent possible, the shape of the facility shall be unobtrusive in relation to its surroundings, and the silhouette of the facility shall be reduced to the minimum visual impact.

1. Historic Commercial District. Facilities in the historic commercial district or on listed historic buildings shall be concealed or camouflaged, when viewed from ground level, adjacent buildings, waterways, street rights-of-way and/or viewscapes, as determined through the HPC review process more fully set forth in Chapters 17.30 and 17.80 PTMC. 

2. All Other Areas. Antennas and/or antenna arrays located on an existing structure shall be concealed when viewed from a ground level view adjacent to the structure unless circumstances do not permit such placement, in which case the antenna array must be camouflaged.

a. For roof-mounted antenna, this may include placement in penthouses or other architectural features appropriate to the particular structure, the design of which must be approved by the decisionmaker. 

b. Side-mounted antennas should be mounted flush on the exterior wall of the building and not project above the wall on which it is mounted; if not technically possible, such antenna must either be concealed or camouflaged into the building design. 

c. For whip or rod antennas, in determining the adequacy of concealment and camouflage techniques proposed, the decisionmaker shall consider whether the conceptual elevations, site plans, photo-simulations, and/or visual impact analysis information submitted by the applicant demonstrate that the antennas will not be visible from the public rights-of-way adjacent to the subject property.

3. Monopoles. Each monopole shall be painted in a nonreflective earth tone that best allows it to blend into the surroundings, or, if disguised or camouflaged, painted in such as way as to effectuate the disguise. The use of grays, blues and greens might be appropriate; provided, however, each case should be evaluated individually. At the discretion of the decisionmaker, monopoles shall be disguised or camouflaged (such as being made to appear as a flagpole, sailboat mast, or evergreen or other tree, depending on the features of the surrounding property) so as to blend in with the surrounding area and to minimize any adverse visual or aesthetic impacts. 

B. Antennas and Support Structures – Specific Height, Bulk and Dimensional Requirements.

1. Personal wireless service facilities, when considered in aggregate with all other construction on a site, must conform to height (unless otherwise specified in this chapter), bulk, dimension, footprint and setback requirements for buildings in the zone in which they are located.

2. Macro-Facilities. Macro-facilities may be of any physical size permitted by this chapter and other provisions of the Port Townsend Municipal Code but shall in no case extend above 75 feet in height above grade with the exception of the water tower property. The extension of antennas in a horizontal direction from a monopole or alternative support structure shall be minimized.

a. Monopoles. Monopoles shall not exceed 160 feet in height at the water tower site, or 75 feet in height at any other location where macro-facilities are permitted. Unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the decisionmaker that it is technically infeasible, monopoles shall be designed so as to allow at least two additional carriers to co-locate at the facility.

b. Height Reduction. Notwithstanding the height standards contained in this section, the decisionmaker may reduce the maximum height of macro-facilities including monopoles based upon the record, the predominant height of structures and vegetation in the surrounding area, and the design standards and approval criteria contained in this chapter and in Chapter 17.84 PTMC, for Type III – CUP applications.

3. Mini-Facilities. Mini-facilities generally should not extend above the height of adjacent portions of the host structure by more than 15 percent (except an antenna array not wider than 48 inches may extend to the height limit for the zone in which it is located). Mini-facilities which are attached to structures established for other uses should be in scale with the host structure. In general, mini-facilities which are independent of other structures should not have a footprint greater than 750 square feet in aggregate, including all constructed and installed elements of the mini-facility (excluding buffers, landscape and screening material, access drive and security fencing, if any.) 

4. Micro-Facilities. Micro-facilities consist of any or all of the following: an antenna array; brackets for attaching the array to a street pole; a single associated equipment cabinet; and cables not over one inch in diameter connecting the parts. Micro-facilities shall be attached to a single street pole on a developed street. The equipment cabinet shall either be mounted on the pole or installed completely below grade in a vault.

a. No more than one micro-facility shall be located on a single pole.

b. Micro-facilities may have an antenna array consisting of a whip antenna not more than six feet in length and not more than three inches in diameter; or (1) consisting of not more than four panels, each mounted within six inches of the pole, with none extending above the height of the pole and none wider than six inches overall; or (2) consisting of not more than three parabolic antennas, each less than 12 inches in diameter, each mounted within 12 inches of the surface of the pole, and none extending above the height of the pole. 

C. Equipment Enclosures.

1. Macro-Facilities.

a. Ground-Mounted Equipment Enclosures. Ground-mounted equipment enclosures shall be painted a nonreflective color so as to blend in with the surroundings. Ground-mounted equipment enclosures shall be of the smallest size possible, but in no event shall be greater than 12 by 12 feet in length and width. Unless otherwise specified in conditions to a CUP, the floor elevation for a freestanding equipment enclosure shall be below grade, at grade, or elevated no more than three feet above the grade existing at the site before the development of the facilities. The roof height, as measured per the International Building Code, of the equipment enclosure shall not be greater than six feet in height above the pre-existing grade. However, enclosures of any configuration may be contained within new buildings which conform to building and zoning code requirements for the zone in which they are located or other existing lawfully established buildings. Any new buildings shall be designed and constructed to be architecturally compatible with the buildings in the immediate vicinity and to blend into the surroundings.

b. Equipment Enclosures Mounted on Alternative Support Structures. Equipment enclosures attached to an alternative support structure shall not extend more than six feet above the height of adjacent portions of that structure which afford screening of the equipment enclosure. When mounted on buildings, equipment enclosures should be concealed within the interior of buildings, if possible. If located on the roof of a building, such enclosures shall either be concealed or camouflaged into the building with an architecturally compatible design. In no case shall equipment enclosures extend above the 75-foot height limit established for macro facilities.

2. Mini-Facilities. Equipment enclosures shall be attached to the alternative support structure and shall not extend more than six feet above the height of adjacent portions of that structure which afford screening of the equipment enclosure. When mounted on buildings, equipment enclosures should be concealed within the interior of buildings, if possible. If located on the roof of a building, such enclosures shall either be concealed or camouflaged into the building with an architecturally compatible design. In no case shall equipment enclosures extend above the maximum building height in the underlying zoning district.

3. Micro-facilities may have a pole-mounted equipment cabinet not larger in profile than the pole on which it is mounted, and having no single dimension greater than four feet, or an equipment cabinet which is installed completely below grade in a vault.

D. Color and Texture. The facility (including all visible antennas, support structures, and equipment enclosures) shall be in colors and textures that minimize visibility, including against trees and sky.

E. Noise. Noise shall not exceed the maximum environmental noise levels set forth in Chapter 173-60 WAC, as it is now in effect or hereafter amended. In addition, if a noise ordinance is adopted by the city in the future, to the greatest extent feasible the facilities shall comply with the standards and criteria of such an ordinance.

F. Screening and Vegetation. 

1. Landscaping Plan. The DSD director shall have the authority to require a landscaping plan when deemed necessary to mitigate the aesthetic impacts of a personal wireless service facility.

2. Screening of Facilities. Existing vegetation which helps conceal or screen proposed facilities from view (including all visible antennas, monopoles, alternative support structures, and equipment enclosures) shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible. The DSD director may require additional vegetation to be planted through landscaping plan review to mitigate aesthetic impacts of the proposed facility. For all screening, the use of trees with significant height and fullness upon maturity is required. The DSD director may also require the wireless facility provider to lease or secure an easement for additional land to preserve existing significant vegetation or to allow the planting of additional landscaping. 

3. Ground-Mounted Equipment Enclosures. In all zones, equipment enclosures shall be screened when viewed from adjacent rights-of-way, properties, and waterways. Existing vegetation which helps conceal the equipment enclosure shall be preserved, whenever possible. When additional screening is required, vegetation of similar species (or as otherwise required by the decisionmaker) shall be re-planted immediately following the construction of the facilities. In order to provide visual relief from the equipment enclosure, the DSD director, in his or her discretion, may also require landscaping in a band of up to 20 feet in depth around the enclosure as part of the landscaping plan.

G. Lighting. In all zones, security lighting is permitted for equipment enclosures, but shall be oriented downward and shielded so that the light falls only within the boundaries of the property, and shall by triggered only by a motion sensor. No monopoles or other antenna support structures shall be artificially lighted, except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other governmental agency.

H. Signs, Symbols, Etc. There shall be no signs, symbols, flags, banners or other devices or things attached to or painted or inscribed upon any monopole or other type of antenna support structure or building, except that the DSD director may require appropriate signage indicating a telephone number and person to call for information or in the event of an emergency, or for any other safety reason approved by the director. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2680 § 2, 1999).

A. Except as specified in subsection B of this section, applications for conditional uses shall be processed according to the procedures for Type III land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures.

B. Applications for minor conditional uses (i.e., a conditional use which is to be established entirely within an existing building) shall be processed according to the procedures for Type II land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.84.050 Approval criteria.

The city may approve or approve with modifications an application for a conditional use permit if the following criteria are satisfied:

A. The conditional use is harmonious and appropriate in design, character and appearance with the existing or intended character and quality of development in the immediate vicinity of the subject property and with the physical characteristics of the subject property; and

B. The conditional use will be served by adequate public facilities including streets, fire protection, water, sanitary sewer, and storm water control; and

C. The conditional use will not be materially detrimental to uses or property in the immediate vicinity of the subject parcel; and

D. The conditional use has merit and value for the community as a whole; and

E. The conditional use is consistent with the goals and policies of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan; and

F. The conditional use complies with all other applicable criteria and standards of the Port Townsend Municipal Code; and

G. That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect. Consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of similar actions in the area. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

A. The proposed use is to be established within a building which is:

1. Individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places; or

2. Identified as either a pivotal, primary or secondary building on the map which accompanied the certification of the Port Townsend Historic District on May 17, 1976, the names of which buildings are listed in PTMC 17.80.120; or

3. Has been certified by the Secretary of the Interior to be contributing structure to the Port Townsend Historic District; provided, that if the building has been significantly altered since so listed, identified or certified, the city may require that the building be recertified by the Secretary of the Interior before granting a conditional use permit pursuant to this chapter; and

B. The use shall not require significant alteration of the architecturally or historically significant features of the structure; and

C. The proposed use will not occupy street level space which is better suited for retail sales or services; and

D. The design of the structure makes uses permitted in the C-III district impractical in the structure, or the permitted uses do not provide sufficient financial return to make use of the structure feasible. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.84.065 Additional approval criteria – Marijuana production or marijuana processing as a conditional use in the general commercial zone.

Establishment of a marijuana production or processing facility as defined in Chapter 17.08 PTMC may be allowed as a conditional use within the general commercial (C-II) zone without a requirement to provide a retail component; provided, that in addition to the standards and criteria governing conditional use permits set forth in PTMC 17.84.050, the following additional criteria shall also be met:

A. Noise. All operations shall follow best management practices so as to minimize unnecessary conflicts with and impacts to adjacent noncommercial land or water uses to the extent practicable given the intended use and zoning. Prior to issuance of a conditional use permit, a marijuana production or processing facility seeking to locate in the C-II zone may be required by the DSD director to retain the services of a qualified acoustical engineer to demonstrate noise levels emanating from operation will comply with all applicable noise levels as adopted by the city in Chapter 9.09 PTMC.

B. Light and Glare. All exterior lighting shall not be used in such a manner that produces glare on public streets or roads and neighboring property, except where required to do so by law as a result of the marijuana production or processing. All interior lighting used in production shall be performed so as not to be seen from any point beyond the outside of the property.

C. Fire and Safety Hazards. The storage and handling of inflammable liquids, liquefied petroleum gases and explosives shall comply with rules and regulations falling under the jurisdiction of the city fire chief, the laws of the state and other local ordinances.

17.86.050 Approval criteria – Variances.

The decisionmaker may approve or approve with modifications an application for a variance from the provisions of this title if:

A. The variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located; and

B. The variance is necessary because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; and

C. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located; and

F. Does not result in an increase in the allowable density available for the proposal prior to the application; and

G. For applications involving a minor variance from the minimum lot area for planned unit developments, the special circumstances of the subject property are not the result of the actions of:

1. The applicant; and/or

2. The prior owner(s) of the subject property if the special circumstances occurred less than a five-year period immediately preceding the date of the application for the minor variance. (Ord. 2983 § 1, 2008).

In the case of a variance requested for the restoration of a historic building designated as pivotal, primary or secondary within the city, and in lieu of the approval criteria required under PTMC 17.86.050, the decisionmaker shall have the authority to grant the variance if a finding is made and it is concluded that the restoration relates to and is reasonably necessary to permit the addition or restoration of a previous condition of historical significance to the building, and that granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare nor injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is situated. (Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.86.065 Alternative approval criteria – Off-street parking and loading variances.

Chapter 17.88 NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES

Sections:

17.88.010    Purpose.

17.88.020    Nonconforming lots – Consolidation.

17.88.030    Nonconforming structures.

17.88.040    Nonconforming uses – General application.

17.88.045    Relocation or expansion of nonconforming uses – M-II(A) district.

17.88.050    Building permits and certificates of occupancy prohibited.

17.88.060    Removal of illegal nonconforming structures and uses.


17.88.010 Purpose.

These provisions provide for the consolidation of nonconforming lots of record in common ownership, and the orderly termination of nonconforming structures and uses to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to bring these structures and uses into conformity with the goals and policies of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan. This chapter is intended to prevent the expansion of nonconforming structures and uses to the maximum extent feasible, to establish criteria under which such structures and uses may be continued or possibly expanded, and to provide for the correction or removal of such nonconformities in an equitable, reasonable and timely manner. Nonconforming lots are legally buildable only if in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Nonconforming structures and uses shall be eliminated as rapidly as possible without infringing upon the constitutional rights of property owners. (Ord. 3078 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.88.020 Nonconforming lots – Consolidation.

Lots of record in existence prior to the effective date of this title and any amendments thereto which do not meet the requirements set forth in this title are considered nonconforming lots of record and are legally buildable subject to the following conditions:

A. Consolidation Clause. Where two or more contiguous lots of record are under one ownership and one or more of the lots is nonconforming, they are considered to be consolidated and may not be sold or otherwise separated so as to create any resulting nonconforming lots.

B. Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the nonconforming lot consolidation requirements set forth in subsection A of this section:

1. Any transfer, sale or conveyance of a nonconforming lot or lots for the purpose of acquisition of property to preserve environmentally sensitive areas;

2. Any transfer, sale or conveyance of a nonconforming lot or lots to the city of Port Townsend;

3. Any transaction for the sale or conveyance of a nonconforming lot or lots where the parties executed a real estate purchase and sale agreement, real estate contract or other legally valid transaction document on or before April 11, 1997;

4. Any transfer, sale or conveyance of a fully developed nonconforming lot that is contiguous with another fully developed lot under the same ownership, conforming or nonconforming; provided, that both lots were fully developed prior to April 11, 1997; and provided further, that before any such transfer, sale or conveyance, the improvements serving both lots must be found to be consistent with the city’s engineering design standards, as may be amended;

5. Any transfer, sale or conveyance of a nonconforming lot that is contiguous with another lot under the same ownership, conforming or nonconforming, that was ever held as a separate lot in separate ownership prior to April 11, 1997; provided, that before any such transfer, sale or conveyance, the improvements serving both lots must be found to be consistent with the city’s engineering design standards, as may be amended.

C. On-Site Sewerage Disposal. Under the limited circumstances where construction is permitted without connection to the city’s wastewater treatment facility (pursuant to Chapter 13.22 PTMC, Sewer Connections), all lots must be in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Jefferson County health department regarding on-site sewerage disposal to be legally buildable. Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this section and the rules of the Jefferson County health department, the more restrictive rules shall apply.

D. Compliance with Bulk and Dimensional Requirements and Engineering Design Standards. All new structures or additions to structures on any lot must meet all setback, height and other construction requirements for the zone in which the property is located. Additionally, the permit applicant shall comply with all applicable engineering design standards.

E. Lot Line Adjustments and Restrictive Covenants. A lot line adjustment or restrictive covenant approved by the city shall be required prior to issuance of a building permit when a nonconforming and conforming lot are contiguous and owned by the same person.

F. Planned Unit Developments Encouraged. Where nonconforming lots are under one ownership, the owner is encouraged to seek development approval taking advantage of the flexible standards, incentives and procedures set forth in Chapter 17.32 PTMC, Planned Unit Developments.

G. Lots Created before 1937. Notwithstanding this section, for any lots created by platting prior to 1937 (the effective date of the State Subdivision Act, Chapter 58.17 RCW), the city may require compliance with Chapter 58.17 RCW and PTMC Title 18 prior to issuing building permits for the development of lots in common ownership. The applicant shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 18.18 PTMC, Subdivision and Recognition of Lots of Record. (Ord. 3078 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2700 § 31, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.88.030 Nonconforming structures.

A structure that lawfully existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title and does not meet the applicable bulk, dimensional and density requirements is a nonconforming structure, and may continue even though the structure fails to conform to the present requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. A nonconforming structure may be maintained as follows:

A. A nonconforming structure which is damaged to an extent of one-half or more of its replacement cost immediately prior to such damage may be restored only if made to conform to all provisions of this title. However, any residential structures, including multifamily structures, in a residential zoning district destroyed by a catastrophe, including fire, may be reconstructed up to the original size, placement and density. Structural repair shall be complete within two years after the catastrophe.

B. Necessary repairs and alterations may be made to nonconforming residential structures, including multifamily structures, located in residential zoning districts.

C. A nonconforming building or structure may be repaired and maintained as provided in and as limited by this section. The maintenance of such building or structure shall include only necessary repairs and incidental alterations, which alterations, however, shall not extend the nonconformity of such building or structure; provided, that necessary alterations may be made as required by other law or ordinance.

D. Changes to interior partitions or other nonstructural improvements and repairs may be made to a nonconforming commercial, mixed use, and marine-related or manufacturing structures; provided, that the cost of the desired improvement or repair does not exceed one-half of the replacement cost of the nonconforming structure over any consecutive five-year period.

E. The replacement cost of a structure shall be determined by the director of the development services department.

F. A building or structure, nonconforming as to the bulk, dimensional and density requirements of this title, may be added to or enlarged if such addition or enlargement conforms to the regulations of the district in which it is located. In such case, such addition or enlargement shall be treated as a separate building or structure in determining conformity to all of the requirements of this title.

G. Historic Structures. Reserved. (Ord. 3078 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2700 § 32, 1999; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.88.040 Nonconforming uses – General application.

A nonconforming use is one that lawfully existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, but which is no longer permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. The continuance of a nonconforming use is subject to the following provisions:

A. Change of ownership, tenancy, or management of a nonconforming use shall not affect its nonconforming status; provided, that the use does not change or intensify.

B. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 365 or more consecutive calendar days, it shall lose its nonconforming status, and the continued use of the property shall be required to conform with the provisions of this title.

C. Additional development of any property on which a nonconforming use exists shall require that all new uses conform to the provisions of this title.

D. If a nonconforming use is converted to a conforming use, no nonconforming use may be resumed.

E. Unless otherwise authorized by this chapter, a nonconforming use may not be replaced by another nonconforming use, nor may any nonconforming use be expanded, intensified, or changed in any way.

F. Application to change a nonconforming use to another nonconforming use shall be reviewed administratively by the director of DSD (Type I). The director may approve, or approve with conditions, an application for change of use if all of the following findings are made:

1. Impacts generated by the proposed use would be comparable to the existing nonconforming use, or if different, would not be incompatible with the purpose and intent of the district;

2. The change will not result in enlargement of the space occupied by the existing nonconforming use excepting for certain pre-existing nonconforming uses in the M-II(A) district as delineated in PTMC 17.88.045(B); and

3. The proposal is for a use which is of a similar nature or of a nature more in keeping with the purposes of the district than the existing nonconforming use.

4. When a nonconforming use is changed in accordance with this section, the property shall not thereafter be used for a more intense nonconforming use. (Ord. 3078 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.88.045 Relocation or expansion of nonconforming uses – M-II(A) district.

In order to provide flexibility while maintaining the marine-related industrial focus of the Boat Haven, the following provisions shall apply to legal, preexisting nonconforming uses established within the M-II(A) zoning district on or before May 8, 2012. These nonconforming uses may relocate within the district and/or expand as provided by this section, and may, as provided in PTMC 17.88.040, change use. Under no circumstance may the number of nonconforming uses in the district exceed three in number (unless future code changes result in more nonconforming uses).

A. Application to relocate a nonconforming use in the M-II(A) district shall be reviewed administratively by the director of DSD (Type II). The director may approve, or approve with conditions, an application for relocation upon finding that all of the following have been satisfied:

1. The relocation does not increase the number of nonconforming uses in the district; 

2. Granting the relocation will not displace an existing marine-related use unless such prior use is extinguished through closure or relocation out of the district; or assurances acceptable to the director have been made that the displaced marine-related use will be relocated elsewhere within the M-II(A) district;

3. The nonconforming use is to be located outside the 200-foot jurisdiction of the Shoreline Management Act; and 

4. Granting the request will not be materially detrimental to uses or property in the immediate vicinity of the subject parcel.

B. Application to expand a nonconforming use in the M-II(A) district shall be reviewed administratively by the director of DSD (Type II). The director may grant the application upon making the following findings:

1. Such expansion does not exceed an additional 1,500 square feet in floor area. The expansion area shall be cumulatively measured over the life of the nonconforming use and shall not exceed a total of 1,500 square feet. For example, if an existing nonconforming use of 800 square feet expands to 1,600 square feet, then future expansion of that use (or a permitted replacement use) is limited to another 700 square feet; and

2. Granting the request will not be materially detrimental to uses or property in the immediate vicinity of the subject parcel. (Ord. 3078 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012).


17.88.050 Building permits and certificates of occupancy prohibited.

A. Nonconforming Structure. When any nonconforming structure is no longer permitted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, no permit for a structure shall thereafter be issued for further continuance, alteration, or expansion. Any permit issued in error shall not be construed as allowing the continuation of the nonconforming structure.

B. Nonconforming Uses. When any nonconforming use is no longer permitted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, no permit for a use shall thereafter be issued for further continuance, alteration or expansion. Any permit issued in error shall not be construed as allowing the continuance of the nonconforming use. (Ord. 3078 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).


17.88.060 Removal of illegal nonconforming structures and uses.

Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to allow for the continuation of illegal structures and uses. Illegal structures and uses shall be removed subject to the provisions of Chapter 1.20 PTMC, Code Administration and Enforcement. (Ord. 3078 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 2952 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2571 § 2, 1997).

Chapter 18.08 LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS

Sections:

18.08.010    Purpose.

18.08.020    Scope.

18.08.030    Application submittal and contents.

18.08.040    Approval criteria.

18.08.050    Lot line adjustment review process.

18.08.060    Time limitation to record approved lot line adjustment.

18.08.070    Recording.


18.08.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to clearly delineate the criteria used by the city of Port Townsend to review boundary or lot line adjustments. Lot line adjustments provide a procedure for minor or insignificant changes in property lines. A lot line adjustment is intended to apply to minor boundary changes, to correct a controversy regarding the location of a lot line, to remedy property use constraints caused by adverse topographical features, or to consolidate previously platted lots into a single parcel for purposes of development under circumstances where the director deems lot consolidation through restrictive covenants to be inadequate. A lot line adjustment does not apply to boundary changes that would result in increased development or density otherwise regulated by applicable city of Port Townsend land use codes and regulations, or to actions requiring the replat, amendment, alteration, or vacation of a plat or short subdivision. The adjustment must be consistent with all applicable zoning, health, building, or similar regulations. This chapter is also intended to ensure compliance with the Survey Recording Act, Chapter 58.09 RCW and Chapter 332-130 WAC. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.08.020 Scope.

The lot lines separating two or more lots of record may only be adjusted under the provisions of this chapter, except as provided under RCW 58.17.040, as now adopted or hereafter amended. Actions which change or impair conditions or requirements imposed by previous platting decisions must be accomplished pursuant to the subdivision requirements set forth in this title; provided, that all requirements set forth in this chapter are met, lot line adjustments proposing lot reorientations shall be deemed to be minor in nature. (Ord. 3035 § 11, 2010; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.08.030 Application submittal and contents.

To be considered complete, a lot line adjustment application shall include the following:

A. Create any additional building site, lot, tract, parcel, or division;

B. Result in a lot, tract, parcel, site, or division which contains increased density or insufficient area or dimension to meet the minimum requirements for area and dimension as set forth in the city’s zoning and land use and state and local health codes and regulations. This provision shall not be construed to require correction or remedy of pre-existing nonconformities or substandard conditions;

C. Diminish or impair drainage, water supply, existing sanitary sewage disposal, and access or easement for vehicles or pedestrians, utilities, and fire protection for any lot, tract, parcel, site, or division;

D. Diminish or impair any public or private utility easement or deprive any parcel of access or utilities;

(Ord. 3035 § 12, 2010; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.08.050 Lot line adjustment review process.

A. Prior to approval, a proposed lot line adjustment shall be reviewed by the Jefferson County assessor. The applicant shall pay all applicable fees for such review.

B. Based on comments from the public works director, public health official, and other applicable agencies and departments, the director shall approve the proposed lot line adjustment only upon finding that the standards of PTMC 18.08.040 have been satisfied.

C. An application for a lot line adjustment shall be processed according to the procedures for Type I land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures. If the applicant seeks a lot line adjustment which will result in a lot reorientation, the application shall be processed according to procedures for Type II land use decisions. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.08.060 Time limitation to record approved lot line adjustment.

The applicant shall submit all final documents for review and approval by the director within 90 days of approval of the application. If the final documents are not recorded within 90 days of approval, the lot line adjustment shall automatically become null and void. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.08.070 Recording.

A. Upon approval of the application, the director shall notify the applicant. The applicant shall then record with the Jefferson County auditor the certificate or document issued by the director indicating approval of the lot line adjustment, together with the legal document(s) transferring title, any applicable restrictive covenants, and the survey, if it has not yet been recorded. The drawing shall be done by a licensed surveyor unless otherwise waived by the director.

B. A lot line adjustment does not become effective until the applicant has recorded the documents required for recording with the Jefferson County auditor. The applicant shall return one copy of each recorded document to DSD, which copy must bear the county auditor’s stamp to verify recording. No building or other site development permits shall be granted until the applicant returns the copy of the recorded document to DSD. (Ord. 2982 § 7, 2008; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).

The amount of the performance bond or other security shall be 120 percent of the estimated cost for the city to contract for construction of the improvements as determined by the public works director, and shall be of a duration in accordance with the engineering design standards. If the phased installation of improvements is proposed, the improvement method report shall describe the proposed phasing, the timing for construction, and proposed methods of guaranteeing and assuring the city that adequate installation of improvements will occur in conformance with the phasing schedule; or

E. By a combination of these methods. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.16.110 Public works director’s certificate of improvements.

No permit for the construction of improvements within an approved subdivision shall be issued by the city until the improvement method report, all construction drawings, proposed performance guarantees, and other submittals in conformance with the engineering design standards have been received and approved by the public works director. All construction of improvements shall be inspected and approved in conformance with the engineering design standards. After completion of all required improvements or the guarantee of the construction of all required improvements, the public works director shall submit a certificate in triplicate to the director stating the required improvements or guarantees are in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the preliminary plat, including the city’s decision approving the plat, and in accordance with city’s engineering design standards.

Chapter 18.18 SUBDIVISION AND RECOGNITION OF LOTS OF RECORD

Sections:

18.18.010    Purpose.

18.18.020    Scope.

18.18.030    Approval criteria – All lots of record.

18.18.040    Application submittal and contents – Nine or fewer lots.

18.18.050    Application review – Nine or fewer lots.

18.18.060    Application submittal and contents – More than nine lots of record.

18.18.070    Application review – More than nine lots of record.

18.18.080    Building and occupancy permits for nine or fewer lots of record – Issuance after final approval.

18.18.090    Accumulative application for recognition of nine or fewer lots of record.


18.18.010 Purpose.

A. The procedures regulating lots of record are established to promote orderly and efficient development of and construction upon lots on a small scale in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 58.17 RCW and all applicable codes and ordinances, as adopted by the city of Port Townsend. This chapter is adopted to provide for expedited review of nine or fewer lots of record platted prior to 1937 through the Type I permit application and review process, so long as an applicant owns no more than nine lots of record within 200 feet of any portion of the property. In situations where an applicant seeks to develop more than nine lots of record, or owns more than nine lots within 200 feet of the subject property, the application shall fully conform with the full subdivision process. In adopting this chapter, the city intends to ensure that the same standards for environmental review and the design and installation of public improvements are implemented for all projects having similar impacts upon the environment and public services and facilities. The city finds that the fact that properties were platted prior to the adoption of Chapter 58.17 RCW does not provide a rational basis for exempting such properties from land use and environmental regulations adopted for the protection of public health, safety, welfare, and preservation of the environment.

B. This chapter provides uniform, predictable standards for property development throughout Port Townsend. This chapter is further intended to facilitate the consolidation of lots of record which are downzoned in the R-I zoning district to implement the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan. This chapter is intended to require compliance with the city’s engineering design standards for public improvements necessary to serve all areas of the city, to ensure that appropriate public services and facilities are provided concurrently with development in accordance with the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, and to ensure that all properties in the city uniformly comply with all regulatory standards and requirements to protect public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the built and natural environment. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.020 Scope.

A. This chapter shall apply only to property development requiring a building or other land use permit where the extension of public water and/or sewer utilities is required, and/or requiring the opening and development of an unopened public street. This chapter shall not apply to any minor construction, including but not limited to temporary structures, fences, and property improvements not requiring the extension of public water and/or sewer service or requiring the opening and development of an unopened public street. This chapter shall not be construed to prohibit the transfer, purchase or sale of lots of record.

B. Upon the request of a property owner of lots of record where property development will not require the extension of public water and/or sewer utilities, and/or the opening and development of an unopened public street, and upon payment of applicable fees, the director shall certify that the lot or lots conform with the requirements of this chapter.

C. Any proposed development of nine or fewer lots of record platted prior to 1937, either in the original lot density and configuration or if consolidation of the lots is proposed, shall be expeditiously processed as a Type I permit application in accordance with Chapter 20.01 PTMC. To obtain expedited Type I permit review, an applicant may consolidate more than nine lots of record into a proposal seeking approval of nine or fewer lots through the use of deed restrictions or restrictive covenants approved by the city.

D. Where an applicant owns one lot of record (and owns no other lots of record within 200 feet of the subject property), or where the applicant proposes to consolidate more than one lot to establish one building site through the use of restrictive covenants approved by the city, the director shall certify that the lot conforms with all requirements of this title so long as the lot meets minimum lot size requirements in accordance with PTMC Title 17, and the lot is developed in compliance with all pertinent requirements of the city’s engineering design standards. The director shall complete a certification of conformance and recognition of lots of record, which shall be recorded by the applicant with the Jefferson County auditor. Notwithstanding certification of the lot under the provisions of this chapter, the applicant must satisfy all applicable requirements of the Port Townsend Municipal Code.

E. Where an applicant owns nine or fewer lots of record platted prior to 1937, the director shall review the application through a checklist established to determine whether the design and development of the lots conform with the requirements of this chapter. Upon determining that the design and development conform with this chapter, the director shall complete a certification of conformance and recognition of lots of record which shall be recorded with the Jefferson County auditor. In the event the director determines that the lots of record fail to conform with the requirements of this chapter, the applicant shall be required to apply for short subdivision approval in conformance with Chapter 18.12 PTMC.

F. Where an applicant owns more than a total of nine lots, including the subject property, within 200 feet of any portion of the subject property, the proposed development shall apply for full subdivision approval in accordance with Chapter 18.16 PTMC.

G. In order to maximize opportunities for creative site design, affordable housing development and affordable provision of public improvements, applicants are encouraged to take advantage of the flexible development standards and bonus densities offered through the planned unit development process, Chapter 17.32 PTMC.

H. Except as provided in RCW 58.17.170, as now adopted and hereafter amended, any lots of record subdivided in 1937 or thereafter shall be recognized as formally subdivided in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.030 Approval criteria – All lots of record.

With the exception of applicants owning one lot of record (who own no other lots of record within 200 feet of the subject property), the following criteria are the minimum measures by which each certification and recognition of lots of record will be considered:

A. The layout, design, density, size and other attributes of all lots within the proposal are consistent with all applicable city, state and federal zoning, land use, environmental and health regulations and plans, including but not limited to:

1. Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan;

2. Port Townsend Zoning Code;

3. Engineering design standards;

4. Critical Areas Ordinance (Chapter 19.05 PTMC); and

5. State of Washington Department of Health standards for on-site wastewater disposal (septic) systems, if applicable;

B. Access to a public road for each segregated parcel is in accordance with the city’s engineering design standards;

C. The probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed development, together with any practical means of mitigating adverse impacts, have been considered such that the proposal will not have an unacceptable adverse effect upon the quality of the environment, in accordance with Chapter 19.04 PTMC and Chapter 43.21C RCW;

D. Notwithstanding approval criteria set forth in subsection A, in accordance with RCW 58.17.120, as now adopted and hereafter amended, development of lots of record may be denied because of flood, inundation or swamp conditions. Where any portion of the proposed subdivision lies within both a flood control zone, as specified by Chapter 19.05 PTMC and Chapter 86.16 RCW, and either the one percent flood hazard area or the regulatory floodway, the city shall not approve the preliminary plat unless it imposes a condition requiring the applicant to comply with Chapter 19.05 PTMC and any written recommendations of the Washington Department of Ecology. In such cases, no development permit associated with the proposed subdivision shall be issued by the city until flood control problems have been resolved;

E. Adequate provision is made for drainage ways, streets, alleys, other public ways, water supplies and sanitary wastes;

F. In addition to other engineering design standards and criteria, sidewalks and/or other improvements that assure safe walking conditions shall be required where students will walk to and from school; and

G. Approving the application will serve the public use and interest and adequate provision has been made for the public health, safety and general welfare. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.040 Application submittal and contents – Nine or fewer lots.

A. The application for recognition of nine or fewer lots of record shall be submitted to DSD on forms to be provided by the department along with the appropriate fees established by Chapter 20.09 PTMC.

B. To be considered complete, the application shall include the following:

1. A completed land use permit application form, including all materials required pursuant to PTMC 20.01.100;

2. A copy of the plat map and any surveys of record and a site plan showing the building envelopes, as defined in PTMC 18.04.060, for each lot, and all existing and proposed utility locations and street or other transportation improvements;

3. A sworn certification by the applicant verifying whether the applicant has any interest in any land within 200 feet of any portion of the subject property. Such interest in land may be by reason of ownership, contract for purchase by agreement or option by any person, family member, firm or corporation in any manner connected with the applicant or the development;

4. If on-site wastewater (septic tanks) disposal is proposed under the limited circumstances where city code does not require connection to the city’s municipal sewer system, the applicant shall provide verification from the Jefferson County environmental health department that the site is adequate to accommodate on on-site sewage disposal system. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.050 Application review – Nine or fewer lots.

A. An application for recognition of nine or fewer lots shall be processed according to the procedures for Type I land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures.

B. Based on comments from the public works director, public health official, and other applicable agencies and departments, and all other available information, the director shall approve the proposed recognition of nine or fewer lots of record only upon verifying through completion of a checklist form that the requirements and standards of PTMC 18.18.030 have been satisfied. An application may be granted preliminary approval subject to certain, delineated conditions. The director shall conduct the review based upon checklists developed by DSD to determine whether the platted lot and street configuration and design of public improvements satisfy approval criteria. Upon satisfying all approval criteria, the director shall approve the original platted lot and street design in accordance with the recorded plat map and shall certify that the plat conforms with all requirements of this title, subject to the requirement that the applicant shall install all improvements in compliance with the city’s engineering design standards. The certification recognizing the platted lots of record shall be filed by the applicant with the Jefferson County auditor.

C. If conditions of approval are imposed, the application shall not receive final approval until all conditions of approval have been met to the satisfaction of the director.

D. Through application review, the director may determine that as a consequence of the geographic, topographic, environmental or other features or constraints of the site, and/or as a consequence of the inability of the proposal to meet any other approval criteria, the platted lot and street layout and design shown on the recorded plat map fail to meet the city’s approval criteria set forth in this chapter and fail to meet the requirements of RCW 58.17.110, as now adopted or hereafter amended. Under such circumstances, the applicant shall be required to apply for short subdivision approval in accordance with Chapter 18.12 PTMC. The director shall issue summary written findings and conclusions supporting the decision, providing the applicant with generalized, preliminary guidance in conforming the application with the requirements of Chapter 18.12 PTMC. The application fee shall be credited to the preapplication conference fee for short subdivision review. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.060 Application submittal and contents – More than nine lots of record.

A. An application for approval of subdivision and recognition of more than nine lots of record shall be processed as a full subdivision, prepared in accordance with all requirements of Chapter 18.16 PTMC.

B. To be considered complete, the application for recognition of more than nine lots of record shall include all information in accordance with Chapter 18.16 PTMC. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.070 Application review – More than nine lots of record.

A. An application for subdivision and recognition of more than nine lots of record shall be processed as a full subdivision in accordance with Chapter 18.16 PTMC, according to the procedures for Type III land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures.

B. To take advantage of expedited Type I permit processing standards, more than nine lots of record may be consolidated to nine or fewer lots by deed restrictions or restrictive covenants approved by the city.

C. An applicant for recognition and subdivision of lots of record may request that certain requirements established or referenced by this section be modified. Such requests shall be processed according to the procedures for variances in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, and shall satisfy the criteria of Chapter 17.86 PTMC, Variances. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.080 Building and occupancy permits for nine or fewer lots of record – Issuance after final approval.

A. No building permit for a structure other than a temporary contractor’s office or temporary storage building shall be issued for a lot or parcel within an approved project subject to this chapter prior to a determination by the fire chief or designee that adequate fire protection and access for construction needs exist.

B. No occupancy permit for a structure other than a temporary contractor’s office or other approved temporary building shall be issued for a structure on a lot or parcel which the director has certified as conforming with this chapter prior to final inspection and approval of all required improvements which will serve such lot or parcel, to the satisfaction of the public works director and the DSD director. Prior to the issuance of occupancy permits, the applicant shall provide DSD with a photocopy of the certification of conformance and recognition of lots of record bearing the Jefferson County auditor’s recording or filing stamp. Installation, inspection and approval of improvements shall be conducted in accordance with the city’s engineering design standards. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.18.090 Accumulative application for recognition of nine or fewer lots of record.

The accumulative application for recognition of nine or fewer lots of record within 200 feet of the subject parcel shall be construed to constitute the accumulative short subdivision of property as defined in PTMC 18.04.060, which is not permitted. The expedited process for legally recognizing nine or fewer lots of record may not be utilized to apply for a series of lot recognitions thereby circumventing the full subdivision procedures. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).

18.20.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to clearly delineate the criteria used by the city of Port Townsend to review and approve binding site plans. A binding site plan is intended to provide an alternative means of dividing land. The binding site plan process provides a means for certain types of land division applications to be processed administratively based upon the city’s adopted development standards and regulations. Binding site plans tie a future development to an approved set of conditions and site layout. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.20.020 Scope.

This chapter shall be limited and only apply to one or more of the following:

A. The use of a binding site plan to divisions of land for sale or lease of mixed use, commercial or industrial zoned property where the applicant proposes a unified scheme of property development;

B. Divisions of property for commercial, industrial or residential condominium development as provided for in PTMC 18.20.030; and

C. Planned unit developments proposed under Chapter 17.32 PTMC for residential and mixed use developments where full or short subdivision of the land into separate, legally segregated lots or parcels is not required. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.20.030 Condominiums.

For the purpose of approval of condominium developments, the provisions of this title regarding short subdivisions and full subdivisions shall not apply if:

A. A land division is proposed as a condominium and does not result in the subdivision of land into separately owned lots in accordance with the definition for short or full subdivisions, but subjects a portion of a lot, tract, or parcel to Chapter 64.34 RCW (“Condominium Act”) subsequent to the recording of a binding site plan for all such land;

B. The improvements constructed or to be constructed thereon are required by the provisions of the binding site plan proposed for a condominium project;

C. The city of Port Townsend has approved a binding site plan for all such land; and

D. The binding site plan contains thereon the following statement:

All development and use of the land described herein shall be in accordance with this binding site plan, as it may be amended with the approval of the city of Port Townsend, and in accordance with such other government permits, approvals, regulations, requirements, and restrictions that may be imposed upon such land and the development and use thereof. Upon completion, the improvements on the land shall be included in one or more condominiums or owned by an association or other legal entity in which the owners of units therein or their owners’ associations have a membership or other legal or beneficial interest. This binding site plan shall be binding upon all persons, businesses, corporations, partnerships or other entities now or hereafter having any interest in the land described herein.

(Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.20.040 Application submittal and contents.

D. Binding Site Plan for Residential Condominiums. In addition to materials required pursuant to subsections A and B of this section, a binding site plan for residential condominiums shall conform with the requirements of Chapter 64.34 RCW, “The Condominium Act.” The applicant shall submit a sworn declaration from a registered land surveyor licensed in the state of Washington that all requirements of RCW 64.34.232, as now adopted and hereafter amended, have been satisfied. The city shall not be responsible for verification that the proposal complies with Chapter 64.34 RCW, but may rely upon the representation of the licensed surveyor. The applicant shall submit five copies of the binding site plan map for review. The site plan shall have dimensions of 18 inches by 24 inches and must be prepared by a registered land surveyor licensed in the state of Washington. In addition to requirements of Chapter 64.34 RCW, the binding site plan map must include the following:

1. The name of the condominium project;

2. Legal description of the entire parcel;

3. The probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed binding site plan, together with any practical means of mitigating adverse impacts, shall be considered such that the proposal will not have an unacceptable adverse effect upon the quality of the environment, in accordance with Chapter 19.04 PTMC and Chapter 43.21C RCW;

4. Approving the proposed binding site plan will serve the public use and interest and adequate provision shall be made for the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B. Notwithstanding conformance with the criteria provided in subsection A herein, a proposed binding site plan may be denied because of flood, inundation or swamp conditions. Where any portion of the proposed binding site plan lies within both a flood control zone, as specified by Chapter 19.05 PTMC and Chapter 86.16 RCW, and either the one percent flood hazard area or the regulatory floodway, the city shall not approve the binding site plan unless it imposes a condition requiring the applicant to comply with Chapter 19.05 PTMC and any written recommendations of the Washington Department of Ecology. In such cases, no development permit associated with the proposed binding site plan shall be issued by the city until flood control has been resolved. (Ord. 2837 § 2(Exh. B § 6), 2003; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.20.060 Review process.

A. An application for a binding site plan approval shall be processed according to the procedures for Type I land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures.

C. Based upon comments from city departments and applicable agencies, and other information, the director shall review the proposal subject to the criteria of PTMC 18.20.050. A proposed binding site plan shall only be approved when consistent with all provisions of PTMC 18.20.050. Binding site plan approval may be based upon certain delineated conditions. The city shall make written findings and conclusions documenting compliance with all approval criteria. A binding site plan shall be granted preliminary approval only, until all improvements are installed or the city has received adequate guarantees or assurances of future installation of improvements pursuant to the city’s engineering design standards.

D. Upon satisfying all conditions of approval, if any, and satisfying all requirements of the city’s engineering design standards for the installation of all improvements, the director shall administratively approve the final binding site plan for filing with the Jefferson County assessor. The final binding site plan shall conform with all requirements of PTMC 18.16.120, Preparation of a final plat, and PTMC 18.16.130, Accompanying documents – Final plat, as applicable.

18.20.080 Modifications and vacations.

Binding site plans may be modified or vacated subject to the following:

A. Binding site plans may be modified only if the modification is minor in nature and the original intent of the recorded binding site plan is not changed and if the modification does not adversely impact public health and safety, the environment, or the delivery of services to the site. The proposed modification must be clearly shown and be accompanied by a letter of explanation. Upon administrative approval of such modification, the modifications shall become part of the binding site plan. If the proposed modification constitutes a substantial modification, the proposal shall be processed as a new binding site plan application.

B. Prior to issuance of any building or other site development permits, including but not limited to clearing and grading permits, a binding site plan may be vacated as a whole only. Vacating a binding site plan releases all conditions and obligations on the parcel associated with such plan. A binding site plan may be vacated with the submission to DSD of a letter of intent to vacate the binding site plan. The letter shall become binding upon its acceptance by the director. If the binding site plan has been recorded with the Jefferson County auditor, notice of the vacation shall be recorded on forms acceptable to the Jefferson County auditor.

C. After issuance of any building or other site development permits, including but not limited to clearing and grading permits, the process for vacation of all or part of a binding site plan is identical to the process for initial binding site plan approval. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.20.090 Distribution of copies and filing.

(Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).


18.20.110 Effect of final binding site plan approval.

A. All provisions, conditions, and requirements of the binding site plan shall be legally enforceable on the purchaser or any other person acquiring a lease or other legal or property interest of any lot, parcel, or tract created pursuant to the binding site plan.

B. Any sale, transfer, or lease of any lot, tract, or parcel created pursuant to the binding site plan, that does not conform to the requirements of the binding site plan or without binding site plan approval, shall be considered a violation of this title. (Ord. 2572 § 2, 1997).

19.04.050 Designation of responsible official – Responsibilities.

A. For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the director. The responsible official shall:

1. Perform all duties of the responsible official under SEPA and the SEPA rules and this code;

2. Perform all duties required to be performed by the city under SEPA, including the provision of coordination with the appropriate state and federal agencies;

3. Determine whether proposals are categorically exempt under SEPA;

4. Make the threshold determination on all proposals that are subject to SEPA;

5. Supervise the preparation of all draft and final environmental impact statements and supplemental environmental impact statements;

6. Establish procedures as needed for the preparation of environmental documents, including environmental impact statements;

7. Supervise the response of the city when the city is a consulted agency, and ensure that city responses to consultation requests are prepared in a timely manner and include data from all appropriate city departments;

8. Determine the lead agency as mandated by the SEPA rules;

9. Recommend procedures and criteria to the council for determining fees to be charged for compliance with SEPA requirements;

10. Maintain an inventory of significant environmental data and maps of environmentally sensitive areas;

11. Provide information to citizens, proponents and others concerning SEPA and this code;

12. Monitor and report on legislation and issues involving environmental matters to the council and affected departments.

B. The director may obtain third party review on city-initiated proposals to review and comment on such proposals. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 2, 1993).


19.04.060 Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more agencies have jurisdiction, the city’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 2, 1993).


19.04.070 Timing of environmental review process.

A. The timing of the environmental review process shall be determined based on the criteria in the SEPA rules and this code.

B. For city-initiated proposals, the initiating department should contact the director or his/her designee at initial proposal formulation to integrate environmental concerns into the early stage of the decision-making process.

C. For city-initiated development projects, the initiating department shall not be the responsible official on that project.

D. For proposals subject to SEPA, the procedural requirements of SEPA and this code shall be completed prior to the city’s issuance of a permit, committing to a particular course of action, or taking action that would either have an adverse environmental impact, or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.

E. No threshold determination is final until expiration of the administrative appeal period following publication of the threshold determination, if not appealed, or, if appealed, until the decision on the administrative appeal becomes final. However, if there is a comment period required by WAC 197-11-340 and no request for withdrawal, modification or appeal of the determination is submitted within the 15-day period, the threshold determination is final at the end of the 15-day comment period and there is no administrative appeal period.

F. For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal should accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission. However, failure to do so shall not result in noncompliance with SEPA or this code.

G. If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to the submission of the detailed plans and specifications. However, the city may require sufficient information to be provided pursuant to the SEPA rules to allow a meaningful environmental review to be conducted. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 2, 1993).

Article III. Categorical Exemptions and Threshold Determination


19.04.080 Adoption by reference and categorical exemption for dwelling units.

A. This article contains rules for deciding whether a proposal is exempt under SEPA or has a “probable significant, adverse environmental impact” requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This article also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference as supplemented in this article:

1. For single-family residential projects, up to 20 dwelling units;

2. For multifamily residential projects, up to 60 dwelling units;

3. For agricultural structures, up to 40,000 square feet;

4. For office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage buildings, up to 12,000 square feet and 40 parking spaces;

5. For parking facilities, up to 40 parking spaces;

6. For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v), up to 1,000 cubic yards. (Ord. 3241 § 1 (Exh. D), 2019; Ord. 2778 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 2, 1993).


19.04.090 Use of exemptions.

A. Upon receipt of an application for a proposal, and for city proposals, the responsible official shall determine whether the proposal is an action potentially subject to SEPA and, if so, whether it is categorically exempt. This determination shall be made based on the definition of action (WAC 197-11-704), the process for determining categorical exemption (WAC 197-11-305) and the designation of environmentally sensitive areas under PTMC 19.04.160. The responsible official’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter applies to the proposal (WAC 197-11-800). Except as provided in subsection B of this section, the city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal, unless the proposal would have a probable significant adverse environmental impact or a checklist should be prepared to be consistent with WAC 197-11-305.

B. Applicants for short subdivisions (exempt from SEPA review in accordance with WAC 197-11-800(6)(a)) shall submit an environmental checklist to provide necessary information for the city to determine whether the proposal includes any non-SEPA-exempt probable significant adverse environmental impacts reviewable pursuant to WAC 197-11-305.

C. In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible official shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental permit or license required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the responsible official shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the responsible official’s consideration is exempt.

D. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the responsible official may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

1. The responsible official shall not give authorization for:

a. Any nonexempt action,

b. Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact, or

c. Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives;

2. The responsible official may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when modifications would serve no purpose if the nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

3. The responsible official may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. (Ord. 2626 § 1, 1998; Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 3, 1993).


19.04.095 Planned actions.

A. In designating a planned action, the city must first make a preliminary determination that the statutory requirements for a planned action, identified below, will be met. The second step occurs when the city receives an application for a planned action. The city must confirm that the application meets the requirements for a planned action. This includes identifying the significant site-specific impacts of the proposed planned action and ensuring that those impacts were adequately addressed in one of the types of EISs mentioned in subsection (B)(2) below. If the significant site-specific impacts have been adequately addressed in a prior EIS, no threshold determination or EIS is required. However, the proposed planned action remains subject to environmental review under SEPA for any site-specific impacts identified in the project submitted and not adequately addressed in the prior EIS, and the imposition of mitigation measures as project conditions.

B. Pursuant to RCW 43.21C.031(2), a “planned action” must meet the following requirements:

1. Be designated a planned action by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council;

2. Have had the significant impacts adequately addressed in an environmental impact statement prepared in conjunction with:

a. A comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, or

b. A fully contained community, a master planned resort, a master planned development or a phased project;

3. Be a subsequent or implementing project for a comprehensive plan or subarea plan, or a fully contained community, master planned resort, master planned development or a phased project;

4. Be located within an urban growth area, as defined in RCW 36.70A.030, or a master planned resort;

5. Not be essential public facilities, as defined in RCW 36.70A.200; and

6. Be consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW.

C. Limitations on Planned Actions. The city shall limit planned actions to certain types of development or to specific geographical areas that are less extensive than the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, and may limit a planned action to a time period identified in the environmental impact statement or the adoption of the ordinance or resolution designating the planned action. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996).


19.04.100 Environmental checklist.

A. A completed environmental checklist in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960 shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter. A checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead 



agency, for making the threshold determination.

B. The items in the environmental checklist are not weighted. The mention of one or many adverse environmental impacts does not necessarily mean that the impacts are significant. Conversely, a single probable significant adverse impact on the environment may result in the need for an EIS.

C. For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

D. 1. The city may decide to complete all or part of the environmental checklist or amendments to the environmental checklist for a private proposal if either of the following occurs:

a. The city has technical information on a question(s) that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

b. The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.

2. For either subsection (D)(1)(a) or (D)(1)(b) of this section, the city shall require the applicant to pay fees for the amount of city staff time necessary for its activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 3, 1993).


19.04.110 Threshold determination.

A. The responsible official shall make the threshold determination and issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS), mitigated determination of nonsignificance (MDNS), or determination of significance (DS). The responsible official shall make a threshold determination in accordance with applicable sections of the SEPA rules, as adopted by this code, and with the consistency and integration requirements set forth in PTMC 20.01.130 and 20.01.140. In addition to giving any notice required under the SEPA rules, or this code, the responsible official shall notify the proponent or lead department on the date of the threshold determination upon its issuance.

B. Each threshold determination shall be noticed in accordance with PTMC 19.04.220.

C. The threshold determination shall be processed within the time lines set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC for Types I, II and III permits, unless specifically exempted from Chapter 20.01 PTMC, and subject to the following:

1. Time estimates for processing environmental checklists apply when the city processes licenses or permits for all private proposals and those governmental proposals submitted to the city by other agencies. The actual time may vary with the complexity of the project, availability of staff, cooperation of agencies with jurisdiction or expertise, etc.; however, pursuant to statutory requirements, the city shall complete all threshold determinations within 90 days after receiving both an environmental checklist which is found by staff to be complete and after receipt of a complete application for any associated actions.

D. Threshold determinations are appealable as set forth in PTMC 19.04.280. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 3, 1993).


19.04.120 Mitigated determination of nonsignificance (MDNS).

A. As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to or clarifications of the proposal made by the applicant.

B. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

1. Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the city is lead agency; and

2. Precede the city’s threshold determination for the proposal.

C. The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice as soon as possible after the time the department receives such a request. The response shall:

1. Be written;

2. State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the areas of concern that are leading the city to consider a DS; and

3. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes.

D. As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to formulate mitigation measures.

E. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the revised proposal, unless the director deems the revised proposal to be a new application under PTMC 20.01.110G.

1. If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant revised the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

2. If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing, and must be specific, feasible and enforceable.

4. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

F. A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 15-day comment period and public notice.

G. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.

H. If at any time the proposal (including associated mitigating measures) is substantially changed, the responsible official shall re-evaluate the threshold determination and, if necessary, withdraw the DNS and issue a DS or new mitigated DNS, unless the director deems the proposal to be a new application under PTMC 20.01.110G. Any questions regarding whether or not a change is substantial shall be determined by the responsible official.

I. The city’s written response under subsection B of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination.

J. Posting of Conditions. The department shall prepare a list of all conditions placed on a proposal, threshold determination or permit and shall assure that the proponent posts such conditions on the department’s notice board in a conspicuous location on or near the subject property in a waterproof sleeve. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 3, 1993).


19.04.125 Optional DNS process.*

A. If the city is the lead agency for a proposal and has a reasonable basis for determining that significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely, the responsible official may elect to use the single integrated comment period as set forth in this section and in WAC 197-11-355. The single comment period will integrate the SEPA comment period with the 14-calendar-day comment period on the notice of the underlying application. If this process is used, a second SEPA comment period will typically not be required when the DNS or MDNS is issued. The DNS or MDNS shall designate the applicable appeal period. Any notice of application or environmental threshold determination shall specify the final day and time for submittal of comments and/or appeals.

B. If the lead agency uses the optional process specified in subsection A of this section, the responsible official shall:

1. State on the first page of the notice of application that it expects to issue a DNS or MDNS for the proposal, and that:

a. The optional DNS/MDNS process is being used;

b. This may be the only opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the proposal;

c. The proposal may include mitigation measures under applicable codes, and the project review process may incorporate or require mitigation measures regardless of whether an EIS is prepared; and

d. A copy of the subsequent threshold determination for the specific proposal stating the time period for filing an appeal may be obtained upon request (in addition, the city may maintain a general mailing list for threshold determination distribution);

2. List in the notice of application the conditions being considered to mitigate environmental impacts, if an MDNS is expected;

3. Comply with the requirements for a notice of application and public notice in Chapter 20.01 PTMC; and

4. Send the notice of application and environmental checklist to:

a. Agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal; and

b. Anyone requesting a copy of the environmental checklist for the specific proposal (in addition, the city may maintain a general mailing list for checklist distribution).

C. If the lead agency indicates on the notice of application that a DNS or MDNS is likely, an agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status during the comment period on the notice of application in accordance with WAC 197-11-948.

D. The responsible official shall consider timely comments on the notice of application and either:

1. Issue a DNS or MDNS with no comment period, using the procedures in subsection E of this section;

2. Issue a DNS or MDNS with a comment period, using the procedures in PTMC 19.04.220 and Chapter 20.01 PTMC if the lead agency determines a comment period is necessary;

3. Issue a declaration of significance (DS) requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement; or

4. Require additional information or studies prior to making a threshold determination.

E. If a DNS or an MDNS is issued under subsection (D)(1) of this section, the lead agency shall send a copy of the DNS or MDNS to the Department of Ecology, agencies with jurisdiction, those who commented, and anyone else requesting a copy. A copy of the environmental checklist need not be recirculated. (Ord. 2982 § 13, 2008).

*Code reviser’s note: Ordinance 2982 adds the provisions of this section as Section 19.04.120. The section has been editorially renumbered to prevent duplication of numbering.

(Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 4, 1993).


19.04.140 EIS preparation – Additional considerations.

A. A draft environmental impact statement shall be completed within 365 days after issuance of the determination of significance. Additional time may be allowed, with the written concurrence of the applicant. All time required for the preparation and review of an EIS shall be excluded from the 120-day deadline of Chapter 20.01 PTMC for Types I, II and III projects.

B. Preparation of draft and final EISs (DEIS and FEIS) and draft and final supplemental EISs (SEIS) is the responsibility of the responsible official. Before the city issues an EIS, the responsible official shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter and Chapter 197-11 WAC.

C.    1. The draft and final EIS and draft or final SEIS shall be prepared either by the city, the applicant or a consultant retained by the applicant acting under direction and control of the responsible official. If the responsible official requires an EIS or SEIS for a proposal and

determines that someone other than the city will prepare it, the responsible official shall notify the applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also notify the applicant of the city’s procedure for EIS preparation including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution. Applicants shall participate in the preparation of an EIS when written agreement is made between the city and applicant that authorizes:

a. The applicant to prepare a draft and final EIS or SEIS;

b. The applicant to retain a consultant for the preparation of a draft and final EIS or SEIS;

c. Joint preparation of a draft and final EIS or SEIS; or

d. Joint retention of a consultant to prepare a draft and final EIS or SEIS.

2. For city proposals, the EIS shall be prepared by a consultant or by city staff.

3. In all cases above, the consultant(s) shall be selected by the city and the method of EIS or SEIS preparation shall be subject to the approval of the responsible official.

4. In the event the city and applicant determine the applicant will participate in the preparation of an EIS or SEIS, written agreement shall be made immediately after completion of the threshold determination or upon agreement by the city and applicant.

D. In the event an EIS or SEIS is to be prepared by an applicant or a consultant, the responsible official shall assure the EIS is prepared in a responsible manner with appropriate methodology and by individuals with sufficient technical training and experience, in the judgment of the responsible official. The responsible official shall direct the areas of research and examination to be undertaken, as well as the organization of the resulting document. The responsible official shall also attempt to obtain any information needed by the party preparing the EIS that is on file with another agency or federal agency. The responsible official shall allow any private parties or retained consultants preparing any EIS or SEIS access to all public records of the lead agency that are relevant to the subject matter of the EIS. Services rendered by the director or other city staff shall be subject to collection of fees as described in Chapter 20.09 PTMC.

E. In the event the responsible official or his or her designee is preparing an EIS or SEIS, the responsible official may require an applicant to provide data and information that is not in the possession of the city relevant to any or all areas to be covered by the EIS, including specific investigation. However, the applicant is not required to supply information that is not required under this chapter or that is being requested from another agency. (This does not apply to information the city may request under another ordinance or statute.)

F. EIS Scope. An environmental impact statement is required to analyze those probable environmental impacts which are significant. Beneficial environmental impacts may be discussed. The director shall consult with agencies, affected tribes and the public to identify such impacts and limit the scope of an environmental impact statement in accordance with the applicable sections of the SEPA rules and with procedures set forth in subsection F of this section. The purpose of the scoping process is to narrow the scope of every EIS to the probable significant adverse impacts and reasonable alternatives including mitigation measures.

G. Procedures for Scoping.

1. The director shall consult with agencies, affected tribes, and the public when determining the scope of an environmental impact statement by any or all of the following means. The specific method to be followed shall be determined on a proposal-by-proposal basis by the director, but, at a minimum, shall include subsection (1)(a) below:

a. The director shall give notice that an EIS is to be prepared, which notice shall provide that agencies, affected tribes and the public may submit written comments on probable significant adverse impacts, reasonable alternatives, mitigation measures and licenses or other approvals that may be required; comments must be submitted to the director not later than 21 days from the date of issuance of the determination of significance unless an expanded scoping process is to be used under WAC 197-11-410. Such notice shall be given as specified in PTMC 19.04.220. Additionally, notice may be sent to any individuals or community groups known by the responsible official to have a possible interest in the proposal. Notice of the intent to prepare an EIS and the opportunity for commenting on the scope thereof may be sent with other public notices concerning the project.

b. The director may conduct a meeting to provide the opportunity for oral comment on the scope of the EIS. Notice of such meeting shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least seven days prior to the date of the meeting. The scoping meeting may be combined with other meetings or hearings concerning the proposal.

c. The director may prepare or direct the EIS consultant to prepare a scoping questionnaire or information packet for distribution to interested parties, affected tribes and responsible public agencies for their response.

2. The appendix to the EIS shall include a summary of the issues raised during the scoping process and whether those issues have or have not been determined significant for analysis in the EIS. If a public meeting is held pursuant to this section, a tape of the meeting or a transcript thereof shall be included in the director’s official file on the proposal, except that a tape or transcript is not required if an informal workshop is held. If an informal workshop is held, a written summary of the workshop shall be prepared. All written comments regarding the scope of the EIS shall be included in the proposal file.

3. The public and agency consultation process regarding the scope of the EIS shall occur within 30 days after the determination of significance is issued, unless the director and the proponent agree on a later date.

H. Consideration of Alternatives Including the Proposed Action.

1. The EIS shall contain reasonable alternatives which could feasibly attain or approximate a proposal’s objectives, but at a lower environmental cost or decreased level of environmental degradation.

a. The word “reasonable” is intended to limit the number and range of alternatives, as well as the amount of detailed analysis for each alternative.

b. The “no-action” alternative shall be evaluated and compared to other alternatives.

c. Reasonable alternatives may be those over which an agency with jurisdiction has authority to control impacts directly, or indirectly through requirement of mitigation measures.

2. When an EIS is prepared for a private proposal, the responsible official shall be involved in the formulation of the alternatives to be considered, and must approve the alternatives which are to be evaluated in the EIS.

3. The EIS shall devote sufficiently detailed analysis to each reasonable alternative to permit a comparative evaluation of the alternatives including the proposed action. The amount of space devoted to each alternative may vary. One alternative (including the proposed action) may be used as a benchmark for comparing alternatives. The EIS may indicate the main reasons for eliminating alternatives from detailed study. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 4, 1993).


19.04.150 Relationship of EIS to other considerations.

Pursuant to WAC 197-11-448 and 197-11-450, “socioeconomic” information is not required to be discussed in an EIS. However, the responsible official has the option to reference or append EISs with other documents, such as a cost-benefit analysis, or to include additional analysis in EISs to assist in making decisions (WAC 197-11-440(f) and 197-11-640). The responsible official should use the scoping process to help identify issues of concern to citizens. For the purposes of SEPA review, cost-benefit analysis should not be used in the weighing of the environmental merits and drawbacks of the various alternatives contained in an EIS. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 4, 1993).


19.04.160 When environmental review has previously been completed.

If a proponent indicates the proposal or a substantially similar proposal has previously

complied with environmental review procedures, then documentation of this review must be provided. For those proposals modified since the DNS or FEIS was issued or not explicitly covered in the prior environmental review, an environmental checklist must be submitted that references earlier environmental documents where appropriate. Alternatively, a copy of, or reference to, the prior environmental document with a cover letter identifying any changes or revisions may be submitted. In the latter case, other additional information may be required at the discretion of the responsible official. The responsible official shall determine whether a new threshold determination is required and whether existing environmental documents are adequate for the current proposal using the criteria of WAC 197-11-600. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 4, 1993).

19.04.270 Cumulative effects policy.

A. Policy Background.

1. There are over 11,000 platted lots, generally 50 by 100 feet, within the city. These lots were platted 75 to 100 years ago without respect to topography, environmental relationships or need for adequate provision of public urban services. Incremental development of a single lot or other action which by itself does not create undue impacts on the environment may create adverse impacts which require mitigation when combined with the cumulative effects of previous, simultaneous or subsequent developments within a given area.

2. An individual project may have an adverse impact on the environment or public facilities or services which, though acceptable in isolation, may be found to require mitigation 



due to the project’s impacts in combination with the effects of existing development in the immediate area or given the probable development of subsequent projects with similar impacts. Further, the individual project may directly induce other developments, due to a causal relationship, which will adversely affect the environment.

3. Incremental property development often creates increased volumes and rates of stormwater runoff which may cause property damage, safety hazards, nuisance problems and water quality degradation. In drainage basins which are comprised of poor soils for infiltration of stormwater, it is the city’s policy to protect existing natural drainage corridors and basins to the greatest extent feasible from adverse drainage impacts of new development.

B. The analysis of cumulative effects shall include a reasonable assessment of:

1. The present and planned capacity of such facilities as sewers, parks, schools, streets, utilities, stormwater facilities and parking areas to serve the area affected by the proposal;

2. The capacity of natural systems, such as air, water, light and land, to absorb the direct and reasonable anticipated indirect impacts of the proposal;

3. Whether an action or project when considered together with prior, simultaneous or known future development allowed under existing development regulations will create undue impacts on existing public facilities.

C. Until a comprehensive stormwater control ordinance is adopted, the following cumulative effects procedures shall apply. In areas where existing facilities are inadequate to accommodate the cumulative effects of additional storm runoffs as determined by the director of public works in consideration with the director:

1. A drainage control plan shall accompany or be included with an environmental checklist and/or request for any city action on a proposed project;

2. The drainage control plan shall examine the cumulative effect, as well as the proportionate share, of the project’s anticipated impact on the volume and rate of stormwater discharge within the drainage basin containing the subject property;

3. Approval of the most suitable method of drainage control shall be made by the city engineer or the public works department on a case-by-case basis;

4. The city, as a mitigation measure for probable cumulative stormwater impacts, may require covenants running with the land giving the city an independent right to recover a proportionate share of expenses for future regional stormwater facilities (within a subject property’s drainage basin) or for remedying deficient drainage systems related to the subject property.

D. An action may be conditioned or denied to lessen or eliminate its cumulative effects on the environment when, considered together with prior, simultaneous, induced or known future development under established development regulations, it is determined that a project will use more than its reasonable share of present and planned facilities, services or natural systems. (Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2367 § 7, 1993).


19.04.280 Appeals.

A. Appeal of a Threshold Determination for Type I, II, and III Permits – Open Record Hearing. The decision of the responsible official on Type I, II, and III permits making a threshold determination of nonsignificance, approving a proposal subject to conditions, or denying a proposal under SEPA’s substantive authority may be appealed to the hearing examiner for an open record public hearing. The appeal process is governed by the administrative procedures for appeals for the type of decision in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, except who may appeal and the time to appeal are set forth in this section. Any such appeal shall be consolidated with the decision on the underlying project. Any remands or requests for reconsideration shall be governed by PTMC 20.01.260 and 20.01.270.

B. Appeals of Threshold Determinations for Type V Actions. The decision of the responsible official on Type V actions may be appealed to the city council and the appeal should be consolidated with the decision on the underlying proposal; provided, however, the responsible official has the discretion to schedule a separate hearing to hear such appeals.

C. Limitations on Appeals for All Types of Permits. When a threshold determination results in a determination of significance (DS), it shall not be appealable. In addition, issues relating to the adequacy of the EIS and other procedural issues may not be appealed under this section.

D. Who May Appeal. An applicant or other party of record who may be aggrieved by the responsible official’s determination may appeal the decision as provided in this section; provided, however, a person may appeal only if they have previously filed written comments to either the pending or threshold determination or on the underlying project. The term “aggrieved party” shall have the meaning set forth in PTMC 20.01.010.

E. Time to Appeal Administrative Decision. A written statement appealing the threshold determination of the responsible official must be filed with the DSD within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of the threshold determination or, if there is a 15-day comment period under WAC 197-11-340, by 4:00 p.m. of the last day of the comment period, except that the appeal period shall be 21 calendar days if a SEPA determination of nonsignificance is issued concurrently with and as part of the permit decision. When the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the comment period shall run to the next business day. The notice of appeal shall be delivered to DSD by mail or personal delivery, and must be received by 4:00 p.m. on the last business day of the appeal period, with the required appeal fee.

F. Judicial Appeals. Pursuant to RCW 43.21C.075, if there is a time period for appealing the underlying permit action, appeals under this chapter shall be commenced within such time period. The city shall give official notice stating the date and place for commencing an appeal. For all decisions covered by the Land Use Petition Act, Chapter 36.70C RCW, this time period shall be 21 days from the issuance of the land use decision, as defined by RCW 36.70C.040(4).

1. Optional Limitation Period. If there is no time period for appealing the underlying government action, the city, applicant for or proponent of an action may use a notice of action pursuant to RCW 43.21C.075 and 43.21C.080. The notice shall describe the action and state a time limitation for commencing a challenge to that action. The form of the notice shall be substantially in the form provided in WAC 197-11-990. The notice shall be published by the department, applicant or proponent pursuant to RCW 43.21C.080, and any action to set aside, enjoin review or otherwise challenge any such governmental action or subsequent governmental action for which a notice of action is filed and published under this section shall be commenced within 21 days from the date of the last newspaper publication of the notice pursuant to RCW 43.21C.080.

G. Exemption. This section does not apply to decisions made pursuant to Chapter 90.58 RCW, the Shoreline Management Act, or the shoreline master program. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-3), 2010; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2703 § 2, 1999; Ord. 2534 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2431 § 5, 1994; Ord. 2367 § 7, 1993).

19.05.010 Purpose.

The Washington Growth Management Act (GMA) requires that critical areas within the city are to be protected by establishing protection standards for minimizing the impact of development of properties within critical areas. The goal of this chapter is to protect and improve the city of Port Townsend’s critical areas for the present and future generations.

Critical areas provide a variety of valuable biological and physical functions that benefit the city of Port Townsend and its residents, and/or may pose a threat to human safety or to public or private property. Managing critical areas is also key to improving the city’s resiliency in light of anticipated climate change. Critical areas include wetlands; critical aquifer recharge areas; fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas; frequently flooded areas; critical drainage corridors; and geologically hazardous areas. These are termed “critical areas,” which also include their protective buffers, and are of special concern to the city and the citizens of the state. This chapter addresses only the city’s critical areas – city council has determined that the city will not designate any natural resource lands as defined by the Growth Management Act. It is the intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by:

A. Reducing the potential for personal injury, loss of life or property damage due to flooding, erosion, landslides, seismic events or soil subsidence;

B. Using the ARC approach to mitigate critical area impacts – avoid, reduce, and compensate:

1. First, if at all possible, avoid adverse impacts;

2. Second, if that is not reasonable or possible, reduce adverse impacts;

3. Finally, compensate for the impact;

C. Protecting against publicly financed expenditures as a result of the misuse of critical areas when that misuse causes on-site or off-site:

1. Unnecessary maintenance and replacement of public facilities;

2. Mitigation for avoidable impacts;

3. Cost for public emergency rescue and relief operations where the causes are avoidable;

4. Degradation of the natural environment;

D. Maintaining healthy, functioning ecosystems through the protection of unique, fragile and valuable elements of the environment, including ground and surface waters, wetlands, fish and wildlife, and their habitats;

E. Alerting appraisers, assessors, owners, potential buyers or lessees to the development limitations of critical areas;

F. Providing city officials with sufficient information to adequately protect critical areas when approving, conditioning or denying public or private development proposals;

G. Implementing the policies of the State Environmental Policy Act, the State Growth Management Act, this code, and the city Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992). 


19.05.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

“Abutting” means having a common border with or being separated from such common border by a public right-of-way. See also “Contiguous.”

“Alteration” means, with respect to critical areas, any human-induced change in an existing condition of a critical area or its buffer. Alteration includes, but is not limited to:

1. Grading, filling, dredging, draining, channelizing, cutting, topping;

2. Clearing, relocating or removing vegetation;

3. Paving, construction, including construction of surface water management facilities;

4. Storage of equipment and materials; or

5. Human activity that impacts the existing topography, vegetation, hydrology, water quality, or wildlife habitat.

Alteration does not include interior building improvements or walking, passive recreation or similar activities.

“Applicant” means a person who files an application for a development permit under this code and who is either the owner of the land on which that proposed activity would be located, a contract vendee, a lessee of the land, the person who would actually control and direct the proposed activity, or the authorized agent of such a person.

“Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas” means land management for maintaining populations of species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic distribution so that the habitat available is sufficient to support viable populations over the long term and isolated subpopulations are not created. This does not mean maintaining all individuals of all species at all times, but it does mean not degrading or reducing populations or habitats so that they are no longer viable over the long term. Counties and cities should engage in cooperative planning and coordination to help assure long-term population viability. These areas include, but are not limited to, a seasonal range or habitat element with which a classified species has a primary association, and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain population levels and reproduce over the long term. These may include areas of relative density or species richness, flyways, breeding habitat, winter range, migratory routes and wildlife movement corridors. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas do not include such artificial features or constructs as irrigation delivery systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or drainage ditches that lie within the boundaries of and are maintained by a port district or an irrigation district or company.

Marine bluffs include those marine bluffs that have been modified by bulkheads or railroads (e.g., along Larry Scott Memorial Trail). Excluded from this definition are steep slopes that have been significantly removed from wave action due to the evolution of spits, lagoons, and protected marshes (e.g., bluffs along Washington Street downtown and above the campground at Fort Worden) or due to intervening, legal nonconforming development that eliminates wave action (e.g., bluffs behind Water Street between the Washington State Ferry terminal and Kearny Street). See “Inland bank.”

“Mitigation” means a process used to reduce the severity of impacts from activities that potentially affect critical areas. Mitigation, in the following sequential order of preference, is by the following means:

1. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

2. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps, such as project redesign, relocation, or timing, to avoid or reduce impacts;

3. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

4. Minimizing or eliminating the hazard by restoring or stabilizing the hazard area through engineered or other methods;

5. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

19.05.030 General provisions – Interpretations, relationship to other regulations, administrative rules, and maps.

A. Greater Restrictions. When any other development regulation of this code conflicts with this chapter, the regulation that provides greater protection to critical areas shall apply. If two or more critical areas are on the same site, the requirements that provide more protection to each of the critical areas shall apply. Any easements, covenants or deed restrictions to which the city is a party, which contain provisions more restrictive than this chapter, may be enforced by the city unless such easements, covenants or deed restrictions are specifically modified by the city council.

B. Interpretation. The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements in their interpretation and application and shall be liberally construed to serve the purposes of this chapter. The Washington State Environmental Policy Act and the regulations of other state and federal governmental agencies may supplement these requirements.

C. Relationship to Other Regulations.

1. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (e.g., shoreline permits, hydraulic permit approval, Section 404 permits, etc.). The applicant is responsible for complying with all applicable requirements.

2. State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). If applicable, these critical areas regulations shall apply in addition to review conducted under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), as locally adopted. The SEPA review and threshold determination shall refer to the applicability of this chapter and any associated special reports that may be required. Subsequent approval of a critical areas permit shall incorporate SEPA mitigation measures as a condition of approval. 

3. Shoreline Management Act (SMA). The city’s shoreline master program (SMP) has been updated consistent with the state guidelines, and the Department of Ecology (DOE) has approved the SMP. The SMP incorporates the critical areas ordinance (CAO) as adopted by Ordinance No. 2929 or as approved by Ecology, by reference (Chapter 6 of the SMP). The standards contained in this chapter apply equally to critical areas contained within shoreline jurisdiction. In processing shoreline permits (including shoreline substantial development permit exemptions) involving critical areas, a review of the project’s compliance with the critical areas regulations is incorporated into the findings and conclusions of the shoreline decision with detailed analysis either in the shoreline permit/exemption itself or in the associated SEPA document, where applicable. A separate critical areas permit is not required. 

D. Administrative Rules/Procedures Manual. The director is authorized to adopt such administrative rules and regulations as necessary and appropriate to implement this chapter and to prepare and require the use of such forms as necessary for its administration.

E. City Inventory of Critical Areas.

1. The approximate location and extent of critical areas will be displayed on various inventory maps available at the city DSD. 

2. Maps and inventory lists are not complete and are to be considered only as guides to the general location and extent of critical areas. Maps will be used for a preliminary determination to suggest the presence or absence of a critical area. However, where additional properties containing features meeting the definitions of critical areas contained in this chapter are identified by the city, properties containing such critical areas shall be subjected to the requirements of this chapter. Where mapped areas are confirmed through an advance determination under this chapter or through site visits and analysis of other available data as part of a permit application to not actually contain critical areas, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3062 § 4, 2011; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2688 § 2, 1999; Ord. 2535 § 2, 1996; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992).


19.05.040 Critical area permit requirements – Applicability, exemptions, allowed activities, nonconforming structures, application requirements, special reports, and advance determinations.

A. Applicability.

1. All development proposals, alterations or activities, structures and facilities located within the maximum buffer distance for each critical area type shall comply with the provisions of this chapter whether or not a permit or authorization is required. No person, company, agency or applicant shall alter a critical area or buffer except as consistent with the purposes and requirements of this chapter.

2. The city shall not approve any permit or otherwise issue any authorization to alter the condition of any land, water, or vegetation or to construct or alter any structure or improvement without first assuring compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

B. Exemptions. To be exempt from this chapter does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore the risk from natural hazards, nor does it grant approval or authorization for any work to be done in any manner which may violate any federal, state or city laws. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity shall be mitigated at the responsible party’s expense.

1. Exempt Activities. The following activities shall be fully exempt from critical areas review, and not subject to the provisions of this chapter:

a. Emergencies. Alterations in response to emergencies which threaten the public health, safety and welfare or which pose an imminent risk of damage to private property as long as any alteration undertaken pursuant to this subsection is reported to the city no later than 30 days after the alteration. Only the minimum intervention necessary to reduce the risk to public health, safety, or welfare and/or the imminent risk of damage to private property shall be authorized by this exemption. The city shall confirm that an emergency exists and determine what, if any, additional applications and/or measures shall be required of the property owner to protect the critical area consistent with the provisions of this chapter, and to repair any damage to a preexisting resource. If the director determines that the action taken, or any part of the action taken, was beyond the scope of an allowed emergency action, then enforcement provisions of PTMC 19.05.120, Violations and penalties, shall apply. After the emergency, the person or agency undertaking the action shall fully fund and conduct necessary restoration and other mitigation for any impacts to the critical area and buffers resulting from the emergency action in accordance with an approved critical area report and restoration/mitigation plan. The person or agency undertaking the action shall apply for after-the-fact review and pay applicable fees; and the alteration, critical area report, and mitigation plan shall be reviewed by the city in accordance with the review procedures contained herein. Mitigation activities must be initiated within one year of the date of the emergency.

b. Existing agricultural activities. If a site has not been used for any agricultural purpose for 10 or more consecutive years from the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter it is no longer considered agricultural.

C. Allowed Activities. The activities listed in subsections (C)(1) through (16) of this section may occur within critical areas or required buffers if the director determines that the proposed activity will not impact the critical area in a manner contrary to the goals, purposes, objectives and requirements of this chapter and no purpose established under this chapter would be furthered by requiring a separate critical areas permit. Allowed activities are not exempt from other applicable development regulations and standards including but not limited to the city’s engineering design standards. If the director determines that the activity needs to be limited or conditioned to ensure impacts do not occur, the director may apply conditions to the underlying permit or require a minor critical area permit pursuant to subsection E of this section; in addition, the director may require the owner to enter into a restrictive covenant acknowledging the presence of a critical area and/or its buffer and restricting future activities on the property.

1. Modification to Existing Structures. Structural modifications of, addition to, or replacement of an existing legal nonconforming structure; provided, that such activity does not increase the potential impact to a critical area or its buffer. Within landslide hazard areas, modifications involving invasive foundation repair (e.g., digging new footings, drilling, driving pilings) or additions that add height to a nonconforming structure require a critical area permit and are only allowed with review of a special report demonstrating that no increased risk of the hazard will occur. Restoration of structures substantially damaged by fire, flood, or act of nature must be initiated within one year of the date of such damage, as evidenced by the submittal of a valid building permit. Structural repair shall be complete within two years after the catastrophe. (See also PTMC 17.88.030.)

2. Operations, Maintenance or Repair. Operation, maintenance or repair of existing structures and infrastructure improvements including: painting, roofing, septic tank cleaning, and repair of individual utility service connections consistent with best management practices if the activity neither:

a. Increases risk to life or property; or 

b. Further impacts critical areas or required buffers.

3. Previously Approved. An application for a building permit on a lot within a development for which the city has previously issued a land use permit, provided:

a. The prior permit or approval has not expired or, if no expiration date, no more than five years have lapsed since the issuance of that permit or approval; and

b. There is no material change in the development proposal or site conditions; and

c. There is no new information available that would alter the previous critical area review; and

d. The director determines the previous review adequately evaluated impacts to critical areas and, if needed, provided adequate mitigation; and

e. The proposed development adheres to the permit conditions.

4. Activities within the Improved Right-of-Way. Replacement, modification, installation, or construction of utility facilities, lines, pipes, mains, equipment, or appurtenances, not including substations, when such facilities are located within the improved portion of the public right-of-way or a city authorized private roadway except those activities that alter a wetland or watercourse, such as culverts or bridges, or result in the transport of sediment or increased stormwater. Retention and replanting of native vegetation shall occur wherever possible along the right-of-way improvement and resulting disturbance.

5. Minor Utility Projects. Ordinary maintenance and repair of electric, natural gas, cable communications and telephone lines and facilities. Replacement of an entire line segment with similar facilities may be exempted where the director determines the replacement would not significantly impact the function or values of a critical area(s).

6. Landscaping. Routine landscape maintenance of existing landscaped areas, including selective pruning of trees and shrubs for safety and view protection, weeding, and planting, provided natural drainage patterns and topography are not altered. This does not include clearing or grading in order to develop or expand such activities in critical areas nor alteration of areas designated for retention as a condition of permit approval. Use of pesticides and herbicides is discouraged. Inappropriate use of pesticides and herbicides that result in adverse impacts to critical areas may be subject to enforcement action per Chapter 1.20 PTMC.

7. Preliminary mapping, survey work and subsurface exploration that result in insignificant disturbance of vegetation and soil.

8. Land clearing ordered by the director for abatement of a public nuisance.

9. Removal of trash and/or abandoned vehicles that results in insignificant disturbance of vegetation and soil.

10. Minor conservation and enhancement of critical areas that do not alter the location, dimensions or size of the critical area or buffer, and result in improvement of the critical area functions and values, including the following removal activities:

a. Removal of noxious weeds or invasive species as identified by the state is allowed when:

 i. Activities are undertaken with hand labor including hand-held mechanical tools with no soil disturbance; when prescribed by the Jefferson County noxious weed control board, herbicides or biological control methods may be allowed and, in areas outside of landslide hazardous areas and their associated buffers, the use of riding mowers and light mechanical cultivation equipment may be allowed;

ii. Plants that appear on the State Noxious Weed List must be handled and disposed of in accordance with the best management practices appropriate to that species; 

iii. Areas cleared by removal of noxious and/or invasive plant species must be revegetated with site-appropriate native species at natural densities and the site must be stabilized against erosion in accordance with the city’s engineering design standards; 

iv. All work is performed above the ordinary high water mark and upland of wetlands; and

v. The following limits are not exceeded: 

(A) Conservation/enhancement plans carried out by agencies with jurisdiction where no more than 3,000 square feet of soil may be exposed at any one time; or

(B) Not more than 500 square feet of soil may be exposed at any one time, as calculated cumulatively over one year, without a permit and critical area report prepared by a qualified consultant.

11. Vegetation management consistent with a previously approved critical area mitigation, restoration, remediation, or enhancement plan that requires ongoing maintenance and vegetation management beyond final inspection and the required monitoring period for the permitted project.

12. Removal of dead or diseased trees and vegetation within 50 feet of a permitted structure; provided, that the applicant receives permission from the Department of Fish and Wildlife for removal of vegetation used for nesting and/or roosting by a priority species.

13. Maintenance of existing city, county, or Washington State Parks trails located in accordance with an adopted plan; provided, that maintenance is conducted in accordance with approved standards and does not involve expansion or fill in a wetland.

14. Development and construction activities located outside a critical area, and which are proposed to occur at a distance which is equal to or greater than the maximum buffers and setbacks required under the provisions of this chapter; provided, that the director determines the specificity of a special report is not required and no useful purpose would be served by the requirement to obtain a critical areas permit.

15. Activities located in proximity to an eagle nest or roost; provided, that the permittee shall strictly observe the guidance and requirements of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (May 2007 or as hereafter amended) and, if required, the permittee’s USFWS Bald Eagle Permit.

16. Activities located in proximity to a heron nest, provided activities are completed in the nonbreeding season (October 1st through January 31st) and no significant vegetation removed from within the WDFW recommended year-round buffer.

D. Allowed Activities for Specific Critical Areas – Specific Performance Standards Apply. For development proposals and activities which contain only aquifer recharge areas, frequently flooded areas/critical drainage corridors or seismic hazard areas, the director may waive the application requirements and delineation requirements of this section and compliance with the general performance standards for development contained in PTMC 19.05.060. The director must be satisfied that the performance standards provided for in the individual critical area regulations for a specific environmental category are met and no purpose established under this chapter would be furthered by requiring compliance with application requirements or the performance standards for development.

E. Minor Critical Area Permits (Type I-A).

1. Minor Critical Area Permits. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the DSD director may, subject to making the findings set forth below, issue a minor critical area permit, with conditions or limitations as determined by the director. Minor critical area permits may be granted only where the director finds:

a. The applicant has provided a report from a qualified consultant wherein the consultant has established a buffer that protects critical areas functions and values and the proposed activity lies outside of the buffer and any applicable setbacks. Proposals requesting reduced buffers or buffer averaging require a Type II critical areas permit; or

b. The proposed activity is minor in nature (such as utility crossings, development or remodel of 250 square feet or less when no alteration of the critical area will occur, or minimal new landscaping) or creates only temporary impacts, and will have no off-site impacts; or

c. The proposed activity is to be conducted in an isolated, self-contained area where there is no danger to private or public property and minimal impact to the environment; or

d. The proposed activity is a critical areas restoration or enhancement project not otherwise required for mitigation of project impacts; or

e. The proposed activity involves the relocation of electric facilities, lines, equipment or appurtenances, not including substations, with an associated voltage of 55,000 volts or less; or

f. The proposed activity involves the relocation or installation of natural gas, cable communication, gas and telephone facilities, lines, pipes, mains, equipment or appurtenances; provided, the utility involves a conduit of two inches or less, a trench of two feet in width or less, and a construction corridor of 10 feet or less.

2. Minor critical area permits shall be conditioned to ensure that impacts to the critical area do not occur, and all activities conducted under the minor critical area permit shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and be carried out in a manner consistent with all laws and ordinances of the city of Port Townsend.

3. Minor critical area permits shall be processed as Type I-A permits.

F. Application Requirements and Delineations.

1. Where either the applicant indicates a critical area/critical areas buffer is present, the area is mapped as a critical area/critical areas buffer, or the director has a reasonable belief that a critical area/critical areas buffer is located on the site, the below-listed requirements apply to the application. These requirements shall not apply if the applicant conclusively demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that critical areas or buffers are not actually located on site. Otherwise, the applicant must identify and document critical areas and their required buffers on a site using technical reports and surveys, temporary field marking, and delineating critical areas on site plans and/or preliminary plats. The following is an outline of the steps required by the applicant in the critical area permit process. These steps supplement and augment the development permit application process set forth in the land development administrative procedures, Chapter 20.01 PTMC.

a. Staff Site Visit. If there is reason to believe a development project may involve a critical area/critical area buffer, a member of the city DSD staff may visit the site to establish the probable existence or absence of a critical area/critical area buffer.

b. Preapplication Consultation. Consistent with Chapter 20.01 PTMC, any person intending to apply for a critical areas permit is required to meet with the DSD staff during the earliest possible stages of project planning in order to discuss impact avoidance, minimization or compensation before large commitments have been made to a particular project design.

The director may waive this preapplication conference requirement if an applicant demonstrates, to the director’s satisfaction, experience with the requirements of the PTMC requirements and process that would render the preapplication conference unnecessary.

c. Prepare a site inventory and survey with five-foot contours, showing all existing natural and built features. The site survey is to be used as a base for the site construction plan. The survey requirement may be waived or modified by the director due to a determination that site factors do not require the specificity of a survey.

d. Provide a site construction plan delineating critical areas, their required buffer area, and significant vegetation (e.g., trees with a six-inch diameter at breast height). Unless the director waives one or more of the following information requirements, a site construction plan shall include:

i. On four lots or less, a plan description and maps at a scale no smaller than one inch equals 20 feet. On more than four lots, plan description and maps shall be no smaller than one inch equals 50 feet. In each case the plan description maps shall show the entire parcel of land owned by the applicant and the certified survey boundary of the critical area on the parcel (in the case of wetlands, this will require a delineation by a qualified consultant prior to the site survey);

ii. A description of the vegetative cover of the critical area and adjacent area including significant species and native vegetation;

iii. A site plan for the proposed development showing the location, width, depth and length of all existing and proposed disturbed areas, structures, roads, stormwater treatment and installations for the whole site, including those proposed to be located within the critical area and its buffer; utility locations and clearing and trenching locations should be identified along with the location of any existing utilities to be connected to the site;

iv. The exact location and specifications for all development activities including delineation of all disturbed areas, the amounts of filling and grading and methods of construction;

v. Elevations of the site and adjacent lots within the critical area and its buffer at contour intervals of five feet;

vi. Top view and typical cross-section views of the critical area and its buffer to the same scale as required in subsection (F)(1)(d)(i) of this section;

vii. Specific means proposed to mitigate any potential adverse environmental impact of the applicant’s proposal.

e. Special Reports. If a critical area/critical areas buffer is confirmed to exist on the site, an applicant may be required to provide a critical area special report prepared by a qualified critical area consultant.

i. Contents. Special reports shall identify and characterize any critical area/buffer as a part of the larger development proposal site, assess any hazards to the proposed development, assess impacts of the development proposal on any critical areas/buffer on, or adjacent to, or adversely affected by proposed activities on the development proposal site, and assess the impacts of any alteration proposed for a critical area/buffer.

ii. Special reports shall use standards for best available science.

iii. Special reports for two or more types of critical areas must meet the report requirements for each type of critical area.

iv. Special reports shall be determined complete by the director, and (s)he may request more information as needed in order to protect the public and environment, and to ensure that the development is compatible with the land.

v. The specific requirements of special reports shall be identified at the preapplication consultation and may be required to be supplemented at the discretion of the director.

vi. The director may limit the required geographic area of the special report as appropriate if:

(A) The applicant, with assistance from the city, cannot obtain permission to access properties under separate ownership; or

(B) The proposed activity will affect only a limited part of the subject site.

vii. Special Reports Valid. Unless conditions have substantially changed, special reports shall be considered valid for five years; after such date the city shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary. 

f. Stormwater management plan pursuant to PTMC 19.05.060(D)(5).

g. A site mitigation plan pursuant to PTMC 19.05.060(D)(6).

h. Waivers of Special Reports. The director may waive the requirement for a special report if there is substantial evidence showing that all the following are present:

i. There will be no alteration of the critical areas or required buffer; and

ii. The proposed development will not impact the critical area in a manner contrary to the goals, purposes, objectives and requirements of this chapter; and

iii. The minimum standards required by this chapter are met.

i. Exceptions to Special Reports. No special report is required for the following development proposals:

i. Any development or remodel of a structure or improvements when no alteration of the critical area will occur; except, any associated construction for additional parking or impervious surface greater than 250 square feet in the aggregate will require a special report.

ii. At the discretion of the director, reports previously compiled or submitted as part of a proposal for development may be used as a critical areas report to the extent that the requirements of this chapter and the report requirements for each specific critical area are met. Unless conditions have substantially changed, reports shall be considered valid for five years; after such date the city shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary. Supplemental critical areas reports may be required to address changes to the project scope and potential impacts or to address changes to applicable regulations. The director shall make such field investigations as are necessary to determine if the criteria for an exception are satisfied.

j. Field marking is required for all development proposals.

i. Prior to the preconstruction meeting, the applicant shall mark the following on the site to reflect the proposed site construction plan: the location of the building footprint, critical area(s) boundaries, the outer extent of required critical area buffers, areas to remain undisturbed, and trees and vegetation to be removed;

ii. Obtain the director’s approval on the field markings before beginning any permitted activities. Field markings are intended to prevent disturbance of critical areas and buffers and may include such items as temporary fences. Detailed requirements may be specified in the procedures manual prepared by the DSD;

iii. Maintain the field markings for critical area(s) and areas to remain undisturbed throughout the duration of the permit.

k. A preconstruction meeting at the development site is required for all projects.

i. The meeting is to be attended by the applicant (or applicant’s agent) and city staff, to review specific project details and methods of construction. Subcontractors such as those conducting grading or excavation work may also be required to attend the meeting. Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to allow attendance by interested citizens.

ii. No construction activity, including land clearing or grading, shall be permitted until the information required by the appropriate critical area section is reviewed and approved by the director.

2. Advance Determination. Advanced determinations shall be made in accordance with the Type I-A process in Chapter 20.01 PTMC.

a. A property owner or person with consent of the property owners may request an advance determination regarding the presence or absence of critical areas on a particular parcel outside of the normal permitting process. A request may be made upon payment to the development services department of the initial filing fee. The advance determination shall be based upon existing conditions at a particular site and shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of the special report. Should the director be unable to make a conclusive determination from a site visit and review of available information, the applicant may be requested to provide, at the applicant’s expense, additional information, reports or studies similar to those identified in subsection (F)(1) of this section to allow a conclusive determination to be made.

b. The director may grant an extension for up to two years upon written request by the original owner or the successor in title. Requests shall be filed in writing with the DSD director at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the approval period. An extension may be granted only where the director determines that there have been no changes in either the site conditions or applicable delineation methods. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3062 §§ 4, 5, 7, 2011; Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-6 § 9), 2010; Ord. 2999 § 1 Exh. A, 2009; Ord. 2929 Exh. A § 4, 2006; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2688 § 3, 1999; Ord. 2535 § 3, 1996; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992).


19.05.050 Critical area permit administration – Permit processing, public notice, exceptions, appeals, fees, and covenants.

This section contains the procedures that the city will use in processing critical area permits, as supplemented by Chapter 20.01 PTMC. This process includes exceptions that may be used by an applicant to lessen the development standards due to unique site characteristics which would make strict application of the standards unreasonable. Means to appeal administrative decisions are also included.

A. Review of Critical Areas Permits and Report.

1. The director, as part of the review process, shall verify information submitted by the applicant to: 

a. Confirm the nature and type of the critical areas and evaluate the special critical areas report;

b. Determine whether the development proposal is consistent with the performance standards contained in this chapter;

c. Determine whether any proposed alterations to critical areas are necessary;

d. Determine if the mitigation plans and bonding measures proposed by the applicant are sufficient to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and are consistent with the purposes, objectives and requirements of this chapter.

2. The applicant shall submit documents that demonstrate that any development proposal submitted conforms to the requirements of this chapter; and, if required, shall provide additional information with a special critical areas report. Critical area reports may be required in order to identify the presence, extent, and classification/rating of potential critical areas, as well as to analyze, assess, and mitigate the potential adverse impact to or risk from critical areas. The director may require peer review of any documents or reports at the expense of the applicant where the director deems it to be reasonably necessary to ensure the accuracy, effectiveness or objectivity of any of the documents, reports or measures proposed within them. A written determination from the director requiring peer review shall include the following information:

a. A statement giving the reason(s) peer review is requested (e.g., possible errors of fact or law, possible error in judgment, possible lack of objectivity, or the existence of additional or new information);

b. A statement of the specific areas of the report believed to be inadequate or in error, or not sufficiently definite to allow environmental analysis; 

c. The specific information sought (such as review of the wetland delineation line, the appropriateness of proposed mitigation procedures, feasibility of the plan or recommended action, conflicting scientific evidence, etc.).

3. The director may consult with other agencies, requesting information on the proposal’s impacts, and review of a special report’s contents that lie within the other agency’s jurisdiction or expertise. A written determination is not required before consultation with other agencies.

4. Review Criteria. The director may approve with conditions, or deny, any development proposal or regulated alteration in order to comply with the requirements and carry out the requirements of this chapter based on the following criteria:

a. The proposal does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, or welfare on or off the development proposal site;

b. The proposal minimizes the impact on critical areas in accordance with mitigation sequencing in PTMC 19.05.060(A); 

c. Any alterations permitted to the critical area are mitigated in accordance with mitigation requirements in PTMC 19.05.060(B);

d. The proposal is consistent with best available science and results in no net loss of critical area functions and values;

e. The proposal meets the criteria in other applicable regulations and standards.

5. Approval of a development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 

B. Permit Processing, Expiration, Modifications and Extensions.

1. The director shall consolidate the processing of related aspects and permits from other regulatory programs which affect activities in critical areas, such as SEPA, shorelines, subdivision, etc., with the critical area review process established in this chapter to provide a timely and coordinated permit process as set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC.

2. Permits shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of issuance and shall expire at the end of that time if they are not acted upon, unless a longer or shorter period is specified by the director upon issuance of the permit.

3. Extensions of or minor modification to a critical areas permit may be requested by the original permit holder or the successor in title and approved by the DSD director subject to the provisions for Type I decisions in Chapter 20.01 PTMC. Requests shall be filed in writing with the DSD director at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the approval period or any subsequently approved extension.

4. Review Criteria. The director shall make written findings and conclusions that the following exist:

a. For extensions, the proposal remains consistent with all land use and development ordinances of the city in force at the time of the extension.

b. For modifications:

i. The modification will not be inconsistent with the findings, conclusions, and decision of the city approving the critical areas permit;

ii. The modification will not violate any applicable city policy or regulation;

iii. The intent of the original conditions is not altered.

5. Extensions shall be granted by the director in one-year increments for a maximum of two years’ extension from the original permit expiration date.

6. Prior to the granting of an extension or minor modification, the director may require updated reports and/or additional hearings if, in his/her judgment, the original intent or the circumstances relevant to the review and issuance of the original permit have changed substantially, or if the applicant failed to abide by the terms of the original permit.

C. Public Notice. The city shall notify the public of proposals in accordance with the provisions of PTMC 20.01.150 and notice of final decision in PTMC 20.01.280.

D. Exceptions – Public Agency and Utility.

1. If the application of this chapter would prohibit a development proposal by a public agency or public utility, the agency or utility may apply for an exception pursuant to this section.

2. Exception Request and Review Process. Application for a public agency and utility exception shall be processed as a Type II permit as set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC. In addition to the application submittal requirements in PTMC 19.05.040(F), the applicant shall address the review criteria set forth below.

3. Public Agency and Public Utility Review Criteria. Exceptions may be granted for transportation and utilities where avoidance is not practicable. Any public agency/utility exception shall be reviewed and approved, approved with conditions, or denied based on the proposal’s ability to comply with the following criteria:

a. There is no other practical alternative to the proposed transportation/utility improvement with less impact on the critical areas;

b. The application of this chapter would unreasonably restrict the ability to provide utility services to the public;

c. The proposal does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, or welfare on or off the development proposal site;

d. The proposal includes measures to protect and mitigate impacts to the critical area functions and values consistent with the best available science; and

e. The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.

4. Burden of Proof. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant’s proposal meets all of the criteria.

E. Exception – Reasonable Use.

1. If the application of this chapter would deny all reasonable economic use of the subject property, the city shall determine if compensation is an appropriate action, or the property owner may apply for an exception pursuant to this section. A reasonable use exception is a measure of last resort for use only in those situations where all economic use of a property would be denied by the critical areas regulations.

2. Exception Request and Review Process. A reasonable use request is a Type II action and shall be considered in accordance with the procedures for such actions as set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC. In addition to the application submittal requirements in PTMC 19.05.040(F), application for a reasonable use exception shall include:

a. Technical studies and other data that describe the possible injurious effects of the proposed development on occupiers of the land, on other properties, on public resources, and on the environment. Possible injurious effects must be described even when the injurious effect will become significant only in combination with similar effects from other developments; and

b. An explanation with supporting evidence of how and why compliance with the unmodified critical areas development standards would not permit reasonable use of the property.

3. Reasonable Use Review Criteria. The director may approve a reasonable use exception and modify a critical areas development standard only when all of the following findings can be made:

a. The application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property;

b. No other reasonable use of the property has less impact on the critical area;

c. The proposed impact to the critical area is the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property; 

d. The inability of the applicant to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or its predecessor;

e. The proposal does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, or welfare on or off the development proposal site;

f. The proposal will result in no net loss of critical area functions and values consistent with the best available science; and

g. The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.

4. A critical areas development standard may be reduced, waived or otherwise modified only to the extent necessary to make the standard reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case. In modifying a development standard the director may impose reasonable conditions that prevent or mitigate the same harm that the modified regulation was intended to prevent or mitigate.

5. A director’s decision to modify a development standard may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section and Chapter 20.01 PTMC. The director’s decision as to whether development pursuant to a modified development standard will cause significant injury shall be affirmed unless found to be clearly erroneous. The director’s decision as to whether strict application of a development standard is reasonable shall be accorded substantial weight.

F. Notice of Final Decisions. Notice of a final decision on any critical area development permit or reasonable use exception shall be mailed in accordance with PTMC 20.01.280.

G. Appeals and Stay During Pendency of Appeals.

1. An appeal of the final decision of the director on a critical area development permit (Type II), critical areas exception (Type II), or on an advance determination (Type I-A) shall follow the appeal procedure outlined in Chapter 20.01 PTMC.

2. An appeal of the director’s finding that a site is not within a critical area or its buffer under PTMC 19.05.040(F)(1) shall be deemed an appeal of the underlying development permit and consolidated with an appeal of the development permit.

3. The director’s finding that this chapter is applicable may be appealed by a property owner, or person with consent of the property owner (to avoid having to obtain a critical area development permit). The appeal shall be determined prior to issuance or denial of a permit on the development proposal.

The appeal shall be noticed in the same manner as the underlying project.

4. Construction under any permit issued by the city shall be stayed until the expiration of any appeal period or the final resolution by the city of any appeal which has been filed under this chapter.

H. Fees. Fees shall be as set forth in Chapter 20.09 PTMC.

I. Hold Harmless Agreement. Unless waived by the DSD director upon a finding that no useful purpose would be served, the owner of a property containing critical areas on which a development proposal is submitted, except a public right-of-way or the site of a permanent public facility, shall file an agreement approved by the director and recorded with the Jefferson County auditor prior to the issuance of any permit or preliminary approval of a short plat or subdivision. Said agreement shall be in a form approved by the city attorney, shall hold harmless and indemnify the city and its employees from and against any liability for damages to persons or property as the result of construction or other action undertaken by the applicant on the subject property and be binding on the applicant and his/her successors and assigns.

J. Record Notice of Presence of Critical Area.

1. Unless waived by the DSD director upon a finding that no useful purpose would be served, the owner of any property with a field-verified presence of critical areas or their associated buffers pursuant to this chapter on which an activity subject to this chapter is proposed shall record a covenant with the Jefferson County auditor in a form approved by the city attorney. The covenant shall provide notice in the public record of the presence of a critical area or its buffer, the application of this chapter to the property, and that limitations on actions in or affecting such critical areas and their buffers may exist. The covenant shall be notarized and shall be recorded prior to approval of any development proposal for such sites.

2. The covenant shall run with the land. The applicant shall submit proof that the covenant has been filed for record before the city shall approve any development proposal and failure to provide such notice to the city or any purchaser prior to developing or transferring any interest in the property shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-6 § 10), 2010; Ord. 2999 § 1 Exh. A, 2009; Ord. 2982 § 17, 2008; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2535 § 4, 1996; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992).


19.05.060 General performance standards for development – Avoidance, mitigation, on-site and off-site, density, minimum lot size, subdivisions, preferred construction practices, impervious surface standards, stormwater plans, mitigation plans.

Per PTMC 19.05.040(D), the director may waive compliance with general performance standards for development proposals or alterations within areas that contain only aquifer recharge, frequently flooded/critical drainage corridors or seismic hazard areas.

A. Avoiding Impacts to Critical Areas.

1. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, before impacting any critical area or its buffer, an applicant shall demonstrate that the following actions have been taken. Actions are listed in the order of preference:

a. Avoid the impact or hazard by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

b. Minimize the impact or hazard by: 

i. Limiting the degree or magnitude of the action with appropriate technology; or

ii. Taking affirmative steps, such as project redesign, relocation or timing; 

c. Rectify the impact to critical areas by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected critical area or its buffer; 

d. Minimize or eliminate the hazard by restoring or stabilizing the hazard area through engineered or other methods; 

e. Reduce or eliminate the impact or hazard over time by preservation or maintenance operations during the life of the development proposal or alteration; 

f. Compensate for the adverse impact by enhancing critical areas and their buffers or creating substitute critical areas and their buffers; and 

g. Monitor the impact, hazard or success of required mitigation and taking remedial action. 

2. Relief from Zoning Setbacks. In order to avoid critical area impacts and satisfy the buffer and setback requirements of this chapter, the director may approve up to a 50 percent reduction in the minimum yard setbacks established by the underlying zoning district for any two setbacks. For proposals within or contiguous to an R-I or R-II residential zoning district, a minimum five-foot setback must be retained. Critical areas permits requesting relief from zoning setbacks shall be processed according to the procedures for Type II land use decisions established in Chapter 20.01 PTMC.

B. Mitigation and Monitoring.

1. If mitigation is required under this chapter to compensate for adverse impacts, unless otherwise provided, an applicant shall: 

a. Mitigate adverse impacts to:

i. Critical areas and their buffers; and 

ii. The development proposal as a result of the proposed alterations on or near the critical areas; and

b. Monitor the performance of any required mitigation. 

2. Unless it is determined that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in-kind and on site, or in-kind and within the same drainage basin or drift cell (if estuarine wetlands are impacted).

3. The department shall not approve a development proposal until mitigation and monitoring plans are in place to mitigate for alterations to the functions and values of critical areas and buffers.

4. Whenever mitigation is required, an applicant shall submit a critical area report that includes: 

a. An analysis of potential impacts; 

b. A site mitigation plan, as further described under subsection (D)(6) of this section, that meets the specific mitigation requirements in this chapter for each critical area impacted; and 

c. A monitoring plan that includes: 

i. A demonstration of compliance with this chapter; 

ii. A contingency plan in the event of a failure of mitigation or of unforeseen impacts if: (A) the department determines that failure of the mitigation would result in a significant impact on the critical area or buffer; or (B) the mitigation involves the creation of a wetland; and 

iii. A monitoring schedule that may extend throughout the impact of the activity or, for hazard areas, for as long as the hazard exists. 

5. The department may require a performance or maintenance bond to ensure completion and success of proposed mitigation.

6. Mitigation shall not be implemented until after the department approves the site mitigation and monitoring plan. The applicant shall notify the department when mitigation is installed and monitoring is commenced and shall provide the city with reasonable access to the mitigation for the purpose of inspections during any monitoring period. 

7. If monitoring reveals a significant deviation from predicted impact or a failure of mitigation requirements, the applicant shall implement an approved contingency plan. The contingency plan constitutes new mitigation and is subject to all mitigation including a monitoring plan and financial guarantee requirements.

C. Off-Site Mitigation.

1. To the maximum extent practicable, an applicant shall mitigate adverse impacts to a wetland or fish and wildlife habitat conservation area on or contiguous to the development site. The department may approve mitigation that is off the development site if an applicant demonstrates that: 

a. There are no reasonable on-site or in-drainage basin opportunities (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high functioning upland habitat), or on-site and in-sub-drainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the natural capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Considerations should include: anticipated wetland mitigation replacement ratios, buffer conditions and proposed widths, available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity); and

b. The off-site mitigation will achieve equivalent or greater hydrological, water quality and wetland or habitat functions. 

2. When off-site mitigation is authorized, the department shall give priority to locations within the same sub-drainage basin as the development proposal site that meet one or more of the following: 

a. Wetland Mitigation Banks. Credits from a wetland mitigation bank certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC may be used to compensate for impacts if located within the service area and consistent with the replacement ratios specified in the mitigation bank instrument;

b. In-Lieu Fee Mitigation (ILF). Credits from an approved in-lieu fee program may be used if located within the service area and consistent with the approved ILF program instrument. The applicant’s qualified wetland professional shall calculate debits associated with the proposed impacts using the credit assessment method specified in the ILF program;

c. Private mitigation sites that are established in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and approved by the department;

d. Public mitigation sites that have been ranked in a process that has been supported by ecological assessments, including wetland and aquatic areas established as priorities for mitigation in city basin plans or other watershed plans;

e. Properties actively managed for preservation, open space or parks by a public entity or nongovernmental agency and approved by the department.

3. The department may require documentation that the mitigation site has been permanently preserved from future development or alteration that would be inconsistent with the functions of the mitigation. The documentation may include, but is not limited to, a conservation easement or other agreement between the applicant and owner of the mitigation site. The city may enter into agreements or become a party to any easement or other agreement necessary to ensure that the site continues to exist in its mitigated condition. 

4. The department shall maintain a list of sites available for use for off-site mitigation projects. 

5. The department may develop an in-lieu fee program to allow the payment of a fee in lieu of providing mitigation on a development site. The program should address: 

a. When the payment of a fee is allowed considering the availability of a site in the same sub-drainage basin with comparable hydrologic and biological functions and potential for future habitat fragmentation and degradation; and 

b. The use of the fees for mitigation on public or private sites that have been ranked according to ecological criteria through one or more programs that have included a public process. 

D. General Performance Standards. The performance standards below apply to any development proposal or alteration on sites located wholly or partially within confirmed critical areas or their buffers. In addition to the following general performance standards, the performance standards of the applicable critical area also apply (e.g., a proposal impacting wetlands is subject to both the general performance standards and the standards set forth in PTMC 19.05.110).

1. Maximum Density.

a. For the purpose of this chapter, maximum density in confirmed critical areas or their associated buffers shall be one dwelling unit per each 10,000 square feet of site area (as defined in PTMC 19.05.020), with the exception of those lot sites containing only aquifer recharge, frequently flooded, critical drainage corridor or seismic hazard areas. The maximum density for sites containing only aquifer recharge, frequently flooded, critical drainage or seismic hazard areas shall be as specified in the zoning ordinance. Areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark and confirmed landslide/erosion hazard areas (PTMC 19.05.100(C)(2)) and wetlands shall not be included to calculate allowable density. For example, only the buildable area landward of the marine bluff edge shall be used in the calculation. ADUs do not count toward density; provided impervious surface limitations of subsection (D)(4) of this section shall apply.

b. The limitation in subsection (D)(1)(a) of this section may be modified under the provisions of Chapter 17.32 PTMC, Planned Unit Developments.

c. The design, shape, size and orientation of lots shall be appropriate to the use for which the lots are intended and the character of the area in which they are located. Densities less than one dwelling unit per 10,000 square feet may be required for reason of geologically hazardous slopes, slide hazard areas, poor drainage, flood hazards, wetland buffers, or to reduce habitat impacts, or other unique conditions or features which warrant protection of the public interest. 

d. Parcels in single ownership with an area less than 10,000 square feet which are in existence on the date the ordinance originally codified in this chapter (Ordinance 2319, October 19, 1992) became effective shall be considered legal nonconforming lots. Development on these parcels shall conform to the procedures and development standards of this chapter. Development of these parcels may be conditioned to avoid impacts to critical areas. Such parcels in single ownership which contain more than one platted lot shall be considered a single parcel for purposes of this chapter. A parcel is defined as any tax parcel in existence at date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

e. Vacant platted lots which are held in the same ownership as a platted lot or lots containing a dwelling or commercial structure lawfully constructed prior to adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter (1992) are excepted from the maximum density requirements of this section as long as no parcel is created which does not meet the lot area or dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance.

2. Construction – Preferred Practices. The following preferred construction practices shall be incorporated into the design of proposed critical area development where reasonable and practicable:

a. Use common access drives and utility corridors; 

b. Design roads, walkways, and parking areas to parallel natural hillside contours while maintaining consolidated areas of natural topography and vegetation; locate access in the least environmentally sensitive location practicable;

c. Use retaining walls that maintain existing natural slopes in place of graded artificial slopes; 

d. Provide for necessary emergency vehicle access as approved by the director; 

e. Building pads and disturbed areas should be located outside of critical areas and buffer boundaries. 

3. Land Divisions – Building Pad. 

a. The following requirements pertain to short plats, subdivisions, PUDs, lots of record and lot line adjustments only. These requirements may be waived only by the director.

i. Identify, for each lot, an accessible building pad located outside of the critical area and its buffer.

ii. Determine the location of a building pad by considering vegetation, topography, critical areas, and the relationship of the proposed building pad to existing/proposed homes.

iii. Identify approved building pads and critical areas on final mylars.

iv. If insufficient land area exists outside of critical areas and their buffers for all building sites, the proposal may be required to develop at less than the maximum permissible density in order to avoid negative impacts to critical areas.

b. Binding Site Plans. All buildings proposed in a binding site plan shall be designed to be outside of critical areas and their buffer boundaries.

4. Impervious Surface Limits for Lots. 

a. The maximum total percentage of a lot area that can be covered by impervious surfaces (including parking areas) is limited by the slope of the lot for all detached single-family developments as follows:

	Lot Slope 	Impervious Surface Limit (expressed as % of actual land area)

	Less than 15% 	30%

	15 – 30%	25%

	Greater than 30%	20%

Areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark, confirmed landslide hazard areas (PTMC 19.05.100(C)(2)), and wetlands shall not be included to calculate land area. For example, only the buildable area landward of the marine bluff edge shall be used in the calculation. In shoreline jurisdiction: In no case shall total impervious area exceed 5,000 square feet for any one single-family detached dwelling and accessory structures (i.e., when a single-family home is proposed over multiple lots, the total impervious area must not exceed 5,000 square feet).

b. The director may grant a waiver of impervious surface limits, allowing the percent of impervious surface to equal the maximum percent of lot coverage allowed under PTMC Title 17 if the proposal minimizes impacts to critical areas and meets one of the following criteria:

i. The proposal uses preferred practices, outlined in subsection (D)(2) of this section, which are appropriate for the lot; or 

ii. The lot has a unique shape or proportion (i.e., a triangular lot, with a circuitous driveway corridor).

c. Wherever critical areas or impervious surfaces limitation areas overlap, the most stringent limitation applies.

5. Stormwater and Erosion Control.

a. Stormwater Management Plan. All development subject to the provisions of this chapter shall comply with the stormwater management manual, city engineering design standards manual, city stormwater plan, and adopted drainage basin plans.

i. Stormwater management plans shall be consistent with the standards contained in the stormwater management manual and EDS manual and must be developed on a case-by-case basis and must contain a technical report that identifies existing or predicted problems and sets forth solutions to each. Off-site measures may be required to correct existing on-site problems or to prevent new problems from occurring. Surface water discharge from the site shall not be greater than historic or predevelopment rates.

ii. If the development does not meet water quality standards established by law or administrative rules, the city may suspend further development work on the site until such standards are met.

b. Erosion control practices must be detailed using best management practices for siltation/filtration devices to control surface runoff during construction in accordance with the stormwater management manual and engineering design standards.

i. Applicants shall indicate erosion control measures on the site construction plan or stormwater control management plan, as appropriate for the project.

ii. These requirements shall be in place following the preconstruction meeting outlined in PTMC 19.05.040(F)(1)(k)(i) and shall be reviewed and approved prior to clearing and grading.

c. Applicants are also encouraged to consult the recommendations set forth in Chapter 5 of the current version of the Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for the Puget Sound and Department of Ecology’s Raingarden Handbook for guidance concerning the protection of native soils and vegetation, and retention of hydrologic function.

6. Alterations and Disturbance. 

a. A site mitigation plan shall be required by the director as an additional report submitted prior to final inspection if critical areas or critical slopes are identified on the site. (The requirements of the site mitigation plan may be included in the site construction plan if properly specified.)

b. The site mitigation plan shall:

i. Detail measures that restore the site to a revegetated condition after substantial foundation work and after project completion; 

ii. Specify terrain, vegetation, and trees, in concert with the stormwater management plan, that restore surface and ground water filtration characteristics to preconstruction conditions;

iii. Retain characteristics compatible with the natural neighborhood environment.

c. Protection of Vegetation. 

i. Areas of previously undisturbed natural vegetation in a critical area that have been damaged by human activity must be replaced with compatible species in accordance with a city-approved site mitigation plan. Native vegetation shall be given preference.

ii. Areas infested with noxious weeds may be cleared and replanted in accordance with a city-approved mitigation plan. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3062 § 8, 2011; Ord. 2982 § 14, 2008; Ord. 2929 Exh. A § 2, 2006; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992). 


19.05.070 Critical area 1 – Aquifer recharge areas.

A. Purpose. Aquifer recharge areas are characterized as porous geologic formations which store surface water that has percolated into the soil (ground water). Currently, aquifers in Port Townsend are not used as a drinking water source. This section provides protection measures to effectively maintain the quality of ground water by prevention of contamination so, if needed in the future, ground water may be used for agricultural or landscaping uses or as a potable (drinking) water source.

B. Classification.

1. Aquifer recharge areas are those lands in Port Townsend which have an aquifer of potential future or current use for drinking water, or which are a part of a system which maintains or affects the water quality of a wetland or other significant surface body of water and which allows water to enter the soil and geologic materials in ways and in quantities that replenish natural ground water systems and aquifers.

2. Aquifers are highly susceptible to damage when the overlying soils and geologic formations that filter surface waters feeding the aquifer are very coarse textured, allowing rapid translocation of surface pollutants to the aquifer. Aquifers under fine textured soils and geologic formations are less susceptible to surface influences and pollution.

3. Aquifers underlying areas that are currently developed or industrialized are more vulnerable to pollution than aquifers in undeveloped areas. Combining aquifer susceptibility indexes with vulnerability indexes allows identification of those areas most at risk. Aquifers with relatively high susceptibility indexes located in industrial areas have the highest potential to become a significant public health hazard. High vulnerability is characterized by land uses which produce contaminants that may degrade ground water quality or reduce ground water quantity. Low vulnerability is characterized by land uses which will not affect ground water quality or quantity.

4. Vulnerability to pollution is a function of depth of ground water, permeability of soils and geologic formations (susceptibility), presence of potential source of contamination, and any other relevant factors.

C. Regulated Development. The following types of development shall be regulated under this chapter:

1. High Risk Uses. The following land uses are considered high risk due to the probability and/or potential magnitude of their adverse effects on ground water. Unless otherwise waived by the director, a hydrogeologic assessment shall be required for:

a. High impact uses as defined in PTMC 17.08.030;

b. Hazardous substance processing or handling;

c. Hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities;

d. Landfills, junkyards, auto wrecking yards; 

e. Golf courses;

f. Chemical manufacturing and reprocessing; 

g. Asphalt manufacturing or treatment;

h. Electroplating and metal coating activities; 

i. Storage and electrical battery processing and reprocessing; and

j. Other uses or activities determined by the city that may be likely to pose a threat to the aquifer.

2. Other Uses. The following land use activities may be allowed in aquifer recharge areas provided the director determines that the proposal meets the performance standards of subsection D of this section:

a. All industrial land uses;

b. All commercial uses including but not limited to vehicle repair and service stations;

c. Above ground storage of petroleum products or other hazardous substances;

d. Any development not connected to sanitary sewers which is located in a critical aquifer recharge area. In cases where on-site sewage treatment systems are allowed per Chapter 13.22 PTMC, Sewer Connections, additional requirements to condition on-site sewage treatment to prevent pollution of ground water may be required. In instances where on-site sewage treatment cannot be mitigated to prevent ground water contamination, the development permit application shall be denied.

D. Performance Standards for Development. All regulated development, as identified in this section, shall be designed and constructed subject to the following standards:

1. Underground hazardous substance and/or petroleum storage facilities shall: 

a. Be designed to prevent releases due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational life of the tank; 

b. Be protected against corrosion, constructed of noncorrosive material, steel clad with a noncorrosive material, or designed to include a secondary containment system to prevent the release of any stored substance;

c. Use material in the construction or lining of the tank that is compatible with the substance to be stored; and

d. Be consistent with any applicable Department of Ecology standards for construction and installation under Chapter 173-360 WAC.

2. Above ground hazardous substance and/or petroleum storage tanks shall: 

a. Not be fabricated, constructed, installed, used or maintained in any manner which may allow the release of a hazardous substance to the ground, ground water, or surface waters of Port Townsend within an aquifer recharge area; 

b. Not be fabricated, constructed, installed, used or maintained without having constructed around and under it an impervious containment area enclosing or underlying the tank;

c. Require a secondary containment system either built into the tank structure or dike system built outside the tank for all tanks located within an aquifer recharge area;

d. Be consistent with any applicable Department of Ecology standards for construction and installation (WAC 173-180-320).

3. Vehicle Repair and Servicing.

a. Vehicle repair and servicing must be conducted over impermeable pads and within a covered structure capable of withstanding normally expected weather conditions. Chemicals used in the process of vehicle repair and servicing must be stored in a manner that protects them from weather and provides containment should leaks occur.

b. No dry wells shall be allowed in critical aquifer recharge areas on sites used for vehicle repair and servicing. Dry wells existing on the site prior to facility establishment must be abandoned using techniques approved by the State Department of Ecology prior to commencement of the proposed activity.

4. Stormwater runoff will be controlled and treated using BMPs and facility design standards as defined in Chapter 13.32 PTMC.

5. Agricultural and landscaping activities, specifically use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides in highly susceptible areas, shall be controlled. Federal, state, and local regulations of pesticides and water quality must be followed, including requirements for pesticide applicator licensing from the Washington State Department of Agriculture.

6. Applicants shall also consider the guidance set forth in Chapter 5 of the current version of the Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for the Puget Sound for recommendations concerning the protection of native soils and vegetation, and retention of hydrologic function, during clearing and grading for development proposals.

E. Mitigation or Compensation. Any regulated development listed in subsection C of this section which results in degradation of aquifer recharge areas or aquifer water quality will require restoration of on-site disturbance in full to preconstruction conditions. Additional compensation shall be required in the form of fines, provision of drinking water for areas dependent on the degraded aquifer, or alternative environmental restoration. 

F. Special Report Required. A hydrogeologic assessment may be required in those areas identified as highly susceptible or vulnerable or for uses posing a high risk of potential contamination. The report shall be prepared by a qualified consultant and shall address site- and project-specific conditions. The city may notify the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington State Department of Health, Washington Department of Ecology, and the Jefferson County health district to request comment during the preliminary stages of city’s review process. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992). 


19.05.080 Critical area 2 – Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas.

A. Purpose. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are managed to provide suitable habitats for maintaining populations of species within their natural geographic distribution so that the habitat available is sufficient to support viable populations over the long term and isolated subpopulations are not created. The following regulations, in combination with the general performance standards for development contained in PTMC 19.05.060, are intended to provide reasonable measures to protect and conserve the habitat of fish and wildlife species and thereby maintain or increase their populations within Port Townsend. Habitat conservation will be accomplished by actively managing to maintain these species in their preferred habitats. However, habitat conservation does not require that all individuals of all species be protected. In appropriate circumstances, impacts resulting from regulated activities may be minimized, rectified, reduced and/or compensated for, consistent with this chapter. 

B. Classification. All areas within the city of Port Townsend meeting one or more of the following criteria, regardless of any formal agency identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter and shall be managed consistent with the best available science. Maps maintained by federal, state and local agencies are to be used as a guide only. Final critical area designations are based on field conditions. The following areas are defined as fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and are identified under this chapter:

1. Areas with which state or federally designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species have a primary association. Federally designated endangered and threatened species are those fish and wildlife species identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service that are in danger of extinction or threatened to become endangered. State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are periodically recorded in WAC 232-12-014 (state endangered species) and WAC 232-12-011 (state threatened and sensitive species). The State Department of Fish and Wildlife should be consulted for current listing status;

2. Lands and waters containing documented habitats for plant and animal species listed in the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Priority Habitats and Species Program List. Priority habitats and species known to be identified and mapped by the Department of Fish and Wildlife in Port Townsend include but may not be limited to:

a. Great blue heron rookeries;

b. Brant and harlequin feeding areas;

c. Waterfowl concentrations at Kah Tai Lagoon;

d. Waterfowl wintering area at golf course pond;

e. Alcid breeding areas (the family Alcidae includes murrelets, pigeon guillemots, auklets, puffins and common murres);

f. Pinto abalone;

g. Geoduck;

h. Dungeness crab.

Habitats and species of local significance may be added by action of the city council where the value and significance of such species locally can be established and sound scientific evidence can be presented to establish that the species’ existence is determined to be locally significant;

3. All public and private tidelands or bedlands suitable for shellfish harvest as designated by the Washington Department of Health’s classification system. Shellfish protection districts may be established pursuant to Chapter 90.72 RCW; 

4. Areas with kelp and eelgrass beds. Kelp and eelgrass beds may be classified and identified by the Department of Natural Resources Aquatic Lands Program and the Department of Ecology. Many locations are compiled in the Puget Sound Environmental Atlas or the current City of Port Townsend Shoreline Inventory;

5. Herring, smelt, sand lance and forage fish beach spawning areas. Times and locations are outlined in WAC 232-14-010, Hydraulic Code Guidelines, Technical Report No. 79, the Puget Sound Environmental Atlas and the current City of Port Townsend Shoreline Inventory;

6. Naturally occurring ponds (or created wetland ponds that are not stormwater detention/retention facilities) less than 20 acres and their submerged aquatic beds that provide significant fish or wildlife habitat;

7. Waters of the state include lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington, as defined in RCW 90.48.020 and classified in WAC 222-16-030, Forest Practices Rules and Regulations. At the time of adoption of the updated critical areas regulations, Ordinance 3198, there were no streams identified within the city of Port Townsend. Therefore, there are no express regulations affecting streams;

8. Lakes, ponds and streams planted with game fish, including those planted under the auspices of a federal, state, local or tribal program, and waters which support priority fish species as identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife;

9. Feeder bluffs along marine shorelines;

10. Marine nearshore habitat areas (i.e., the area encompassing the extreme low tide limit to the ordinary high water mark) and associated vegetated marine riparian areas; and

11. State natural area preserves, natural resource conservation areas, and state wildlife areas. The city concludes that there are none within the city’s jurisdiction at the time of adoption of this chapter.

C. Regulated Development. Unless specifically exempted under PTMC 19.05.040, all development proposals or alterations in classified fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall comply with the standards included in subsections D through G of this section. Designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas that are within shoreline jurisdiction are also regulated under the city’s shoreline master program. 

D. Performance Standards Applicable to All Development.

1. All development proposals or alterations in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall:

b. Development activities allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be consistent with the species located there, and shall be regulated additionally by restrictions defined in applicable federal, state and local regulations regarding the species. Development in or adjacent to areas used by state priority species shall be designed, located and constructed in consideration of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife habitat recommendations.

c. Incorporate best management practices (BMPs), including measures to avoid impacts due to construction noise, light and timing.

2. Habitat conservation areas identified in required habitat management plans are to be conserved for the management and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat. Habitat conservation areas may overlap with other identified critical areas. Likely areas of overlap include critical drainage corridors, geologically hazardous areas and wetlands.

E. Performance Standards for Terrestrial Habitats and Species.

1. Unless otherwise waived by the director, a habitat management plan shall be required for any development in or adjacent to areas identified as habitat for endangered, threatened or sensitive species and for breeding or nesting habitat of priority species. The plan shall incorporate mitigation recommendations developed in consideration of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife habitat recommendations.

2. The habitat management plan shall show the exact location and extent of habitat conservation areas and any alteration of any habitat areas that may reduce the likelihood that the above listed species will survive or reproduce.

3. Bald Eagle Nests or Communal Roost. When a proposed activity may impact a bald eagle nest or roost, prior to the activity, the permittee shall strictly observe the guidance and requirements of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (May 2007 or as hereinafter amended) and, if required, the permittee’s USFWS Bald Eagle Permit.

4. Great Blue Heron Rookeries. Unless otherwise allowed pursuant to PTMC 19.05.040(C), a habitat management plan is required when a proposed activity may impact a rookery.

a. For residential development, total impervious surface area shall be limited to 20 percent of the actual land areas. In no case shall total impervious area exceed 5,000 square feet for any one single-family detached dwelling and accessory structure (i.e., when a single-family home is proposed over multiple lots the total impervious area must not exceed 5,000 square feet);

b. For nonresidential development, total impervious surface area shall be limited to 40 percent or 4,000 square feet, whichever is less; and

c. At least 25 percent of the lot shall be required to be retained or restored in native vegetation.

G. Additional Performance Standards for Marine Habitats and Species.

1. Development in areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark shall require a critical areas report and shall give special consideration to the preservation and enhancement of anadromous fish habitat.

2. Development proposals shall be designed to first avoid and then minimize environmental impacts through the use of best available science and best management practices (e.g., Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Aquatic Habitat Guideline documents including WDFW’s Marine Shoreline Design Guidelines (Publication 01583)).

3. Unavoidable impacts to marine habitat and environmental processes shall be mitigated to achieve no net loss of habitat function. 

4. All in-water development shall meet the requirements of the hydraulic project approval (HPA) process administered by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

H. Buffers or Setbacks. 

1. The buffer width shall be established by an approved critical areas report prepared by a qualified consultant. To retain adequate natural habitat for classified species, buffer needs shall be assigned on a case-by-case basis, and the process and justification shall be described in the required critical areas report.

2. Buffers shall be based on Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife priority habitat and species management recommendations. 

3. Buffer widths may be increased by the director if species present are sensitive to or endangered by habitat alteration, or if the area supports unique or rare plant communities, or contains rearing and nesting sites for endangered, threatened or priority species. 

4. Buffer widths may be reduced by the director if the project includes buffer enhancement as part of an approved habitat management plan or if it is found that the affected property would be denied reasonable use as defined in PTMC 19.05.050(E).

5. Building setback lines shall be measured from the outside edge of required buffers and no setback shall be less than 15 feet from an established buffer.

I. Mitigation or Compensation. Mitigation measures shall be based on the best available science and may include, but are not limited to:

1. Establishment of buffer zones; 

2. Preservation of critically important vegetation and/or habitat features such as snags and downed wood, plants and trees;

3. Limitation of access to habitat area including fencing to deter unauthorized access;

1. Any development in or adjacent to areas identified as habitat for endangered, threatened or sensitive species or for breeding or nesting habitat of priority species. 

2. Development in areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

3. Any development likely to cause impacts to marine habitat and environmental processes.

4. Unless otherwise exempt under Chapter 16.08 PTMC, a permit application to develop in the special flood hazard area shall include an assessment of the impact of the project on federal, state or locally protected species and habitat, water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat.

K. Report Content.

1. Habitat Assessment. A habitat assessment is an investigation of the project area to evaluate the potential presence or absence of designated critical fish or wildlife species or habitat. A critical areas report for a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area shall contain an assessment of habitats, including the following site- and proposal-related information at a minimum:

a. A project description including construction methods and timing;

b. Proposed site plan that includes the exact location and extent of habitat conservation areas, their associated buffers and proposed alteration of habitat areas. The site plan shall be prepared in sufficient detail to enable assessment of potential adverse impacts;

c. A detailed description of existing conditions on site and within 300 feet of the project area including topography, vegetation, all fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, shoreline areas, floodplains, other critical areas, and related buffers; 

d. Identification of any species of local importance, priority species, or endangered, threatened, sensitive, or candidate species that have a primary association with habitat on or adjacent to the project area, and assessment of potential project impacts to the use of the site by the species;

f. A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect habitat after the project site has been developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance program.

2. Habitat Management Plan. If the habitat assessment concludes the project is expected to have an adverse effect on water quality and/or habitat or habitat functions, the applicant shall provide a plan to mitigate those impacts. The plan shall incorporate mitigation recommendations consistent with Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife habitat recommendations.

L. Additional Information Required for Special Flood Hazard Areas Pursuant to PTMC 16.08.130(F).

1. In addition to the habitat assessment requirements in subsection (K)(1) of this section, the habitat impact assessment shall be:

a. A biological evaluation or biological assessment developed per 50 CFR 402.12 to initiate federal interagency consultation under Endangered Species Act Section 7(a)(2); or 

b. Documentation that the activity fits within Section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act; or 

c. Documentation that the activity fits within a habitat conservation plan approved pursuant to Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act, where any such assessment has been prepared or is otherwise made available; or 

d. An assessment prepared in accordance with Regional Guidance for Floodplain Habitat Assessment and Mitigation, FEMA Region X, 2010. The assessment shall determine if the project would adversely affect: 

i. Species that are federal, state or local listed as threatened or endangered;

ii. The primary constituent elements for critical habitat, when designated;

iii. Essential fish habitat designated by the National Marine Fisheries Service;

iv. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas; 

v. Other protected areas and elements necessary for species conservation. 

2. Habitat Management Plan Required for Special Flood Hazard Areas Pursuant to PTMC 16.08.130(F). If the habitat assessment concludes the project is expected to have an adverse effect on water quality and/or aquatic or riparian habitat or habitat functions, the applicant shall provide a plan to mitigate those impacts. The habitat management plan must be prepared in accordance with Regional Guidance for Floodplain Habitat Assessment and Mitigation, FEMA Region X, 2010. 

a. If the USFWS or NMFS issues an incidental take permit under Section 10 ESA, or biological opinion under Section 7 ESA, then it can be considered to qualify as a plan to mitigate those impacts. 

b. If the project is located outside the protected area, the mitigation plan shall include such avoidance, minimization, restoration, or compensation measures so that indirect adverse effects of development in the floodplain (effects to stormwater, riparian vegetation, bank stability, channel migration, hyporheic zones, wetlands, etc.) are mitigated such that equivalent or better habitat protection is provided. 

c. If the project is located in the protected area, the mitigation plan shall stipulate such avoidance measures as are needed to ensure that there is no adverse effect during any phase of the project. 

d. The plan’s habitat mitigation activities shall be incorporated into the proposed project. The floodplain development permit shall be based on the redesigned project and its mitigation components.

e. The building official shall not issue a certification of use or a certificate of occupancy until all work identified in the habitat assessment and mitigation plan has been completed or the applicant has provided the necessary assurance device in a form acceptable to the city attorney that unfinished portions of the project will be completed.

M. Additional Information Required in Shoreline Jurisdiction. In addition to the information required in subsection K of this section, critical areas reports must assess compliance with development regulations included in applicable sections of Chapter 6, Environmental Protection, of the city’s shoreline master program. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3062 §§ 9 – 11, 2011; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992). 


19.05.090 Critical area 3 – Frequently flooded areas and critical drainage corridors.

A. Purpose.

1. The purpose of frequently flooded area regulations is to safeguard the public from threats to life or property associated with flooding, and to preserve the natural function of floodplains to store and control floodwaters, improve water quality and to provide for aquifer recharge.

2. The purpose of critical drainage corridor regulations is to mitigate flooding, drainage, erosion or sedimentation problems that have resulted or may result from the cumulative impacts of development and urbanization.

B. Classification. The following areas are defined as frequently flooded areas or critical drainage corridors and are protected under this chapter:

1. Frequently flooded areas are those lands which can be expected to flood at a frequency of once every 100 years, or which are subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any year. These areas are mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as “special flood hazards areas” indicated by zone “A” or “V” on the National Flood Insurance Program’s maps including AE, AO, AH, A1-99 and VE or as determined and designated by public works through basin modeling studies. 

2. Critical drainage corridors (CDCs) are characterized as a year-round or intermittent naturally flowing watercourse which exhibits but is not limited to one or more of the following characteristics:

a. A stream or watercourse formed by nature or modified by humans;

b. Generally consisting of a defined channel with a bed for a substantial portion of its length on the lot; and/or

c. Perched ponds, ravines or other natural drainage features.

3. Critical drainage corridors have been identified and mapped by the public works department using the above criteria.

C. Regulated Development. Unless specifically exempted under PTMC 19.05.040(B):

1. All development proposals and alterations located within frequently flooded areas shall be regulated under this chapter, as well as Chapter 16.08 PTMC, Flood Damage Prevention.

2. All development proposals and alterations located on a site within a critical drainage area shall require the applicant to provide a survey of the centerline of a watercourse with the application for development. The project applicant shall be required to indicate the critical drainage corridor on the site construction plan (see reports and surveys) and these areas shall be marked in the field prior to the preconstruction meeting. Corridors shall be no less than 25 feet on each side of the centerline of the lowest point; the director of public works may require a larger corridor where warranted by field conditions.

D. Performance Standards for Development.

1. Standards for Frequently Flooded Areas.

a. Where applicable, development shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 16.08 PTMC, Flood Damage Prevention.

b. Development shall not reduce the effective base flood storage volume. With the exception of marine waters, effective storage volume must be maintained or mitigated in accordance with subsection F of this section, Mitigation or Compensation.

c. For those basins within Port Townsend having no natural outlet, the director may choose to increase design standards as needed to protect against damages that may result due to the increased likelihood of flooding.

2. Standards for Critical Drainage Corridors.

a. Access roads, trail crossings, and utilities may be allowed to cross critical drainage corridors where the city determines that no other practicable alternative exists and all unavoidable impacts are fully mitigated consistent with this chapter.

b. No fill or impervious surface is permitted within a critical drainage corridor except as outlined in subsection (D)(2)(a) of this section.

c. No mechanized power equipment may enter or be used within a critical drainage corridor without the written approval of the DSD director.

d. Building pads are not permitted within a critical drainage corridor.

e. Native and existing vegetation shall be maintained to the extent practicable.

E. Buffers and Setbacks. None; however, where frequently flooded areas or critical drainage areas overlap other critical areas, the larger buffer shall apply.

F. Mitigation or Compensation. 

1. Development activities that would reduce the floodwater storage volume effectiveness shall be mitigated by creating compensatory storage on site if hydrologically practicable and consistent with watershed functional priorities, or, if allowed by the director, may be created off site, but within the same drainage basin.

2. The applicant shall design such compensatory storage facilities to meet or exceed current standards and design criteria contained or referenced in the city’s EDS manual.

3. The applicant shall provide a long-term maintenance plan for storage facilities.

4. If conditions warrant, the city may be requested, or may choose, to take over long-term maintenance of these facilities under appropriate legal agreements.

5. If development activity is allowed under this subsection, the applicant must sign a “hold-harmless” agreement indemnifying the city from claims related to the activity.

G. Special Reports. Unless otherwise waived by the director, development proposals or alterations located within frequently flooded areas and/or critical drainage corridors shall require a report prepared by a qualified consultant documenting that the proposed development meets the performance standards for development in subsection D of this section and, where impacts occur, impacts have been mitigated to ensure no net loss of critical area functions. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2535 § 5, 1996; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992). 


19.05.100 Critical area 4 – Geologically hazardous area.

A. Purpose. These critical areas are characterized by lot slope, soil type, geologic material, and ground water that may combine to create problems with slope stability, erosion and water quality during and after construction or during natural events such as earthquakes or excessive rainstorms. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. The following regulations, in combination with the performance standards for development, will guide development in these critical areas. The purpose of these regulations is to maintain the natural integrity of geologically hazardous areas and their buffers in order to protect adjacent lands from the impacts of landslides, mudslides, subsidence, excessive erosion and seismic events, and to safeguard the public from these threats to life or property. Construction in geologically hazardous areas will not be allowed when the potential risk to public health and safety cannot be reduced to a level comparable to the risk if the site were stable. This section acknowledges that some potential risk due to construction in these areas can be reduced through appropriate site planning and structural engineering design.

B. Classification. Areas in the city susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as a geologically hazardous area:

1. Erosion hazard;

2. Landslide hazard;

3. Seismic hazard;

4. Tsunami hazard.

C. Designation of Specific Geologically Hazardous Areas.

1. Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas include areas likely to become unstable, such as bluffs, steep slopes, and areas with unconsolidated soils. Any area containing soil or soil complexes described or mapped within the United States Department of Agriculture/Soil Conservation Service Soil Survey for Jefferson County as having a severe to very severe erosion hazard potential.

2. Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Examples of these may include the following:

a. Areas of historic failures, such as:

i. Those areas delineated by the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “severe” limitation for building site development;

ii. Those areas mapped by Ecology (Coastal Zone Atlas) or Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) (slope stability mapping) as unstable (U or Class 3), unstable old slides (UOS or Class 4), or unstable recent slides (URS or Class 5);

iii. Areas designated as landslides on maps published by the USGS or WDNR; or

iv. Areas mapped in the Liquefaction Susceptibility Map of Jefferson County published by the Washington Department of Natural Resources;

b. Areas with all three of the following characteristics:

i. Slopes steeper than 15 percent; 

ii. Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and 

iii. Springs or ground water seepage;

c. Any area potentially subject to mass movement due to a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors, but not limited to those areas mapped or described by the Soil Conservation Service, the Washington State Department of Ecology, Department of Natural Resources or U.S. Geologic Service. These classifications may be based on performance standards rather than mapping;

d. Any area potentially unstable due to erosion or sloughing as a result of rapid stormwater runoff, soil saturation or undercutting by wave action; 

e. Critical Slopes. Any slope of 40 percent or steeper that exceeds a vertical height of 10 feet over a 25-foot horizontal run.

3. Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are areas subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquakes, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction or faulting. These areas are identified by the presence of poorly drained soils (greater than 50 percent silt and less than 35 percent coarse material), loose sand or gravel, peat, artificial fill and landslide materials, or soils with high organic content.

4. Tsunami Hazard Areas. Tsunami hazard areas are coastal areas and large lake areas susceptible to flooding and inundation as the result of excessive wave action derived from seismic or other geologic events. These areas have been mapped by WDNR.

D. Regulated Development.

1. Seismic and Tsunami Hazard Areas. Development proposals in seismic and tsunami hazard areas may be allowed and the director may waive the requirement for a critical areas permit per PTMC 19.05.040(C) provided the development shall comply with the provisions of subsection E of this section.

2. Development or alterations in landslide or erosion hazard areas or their associated buffers shall comply with the provisions of PTMC 19.05.060 and standards included in subsection E of this section.

E. Performance Standards for Development. 

1. Standards for Seismic Hazard Areas and Tsunami Hazard Areas.

a. Standards for development of structures and improvements in seismic or tsunami hazard areas shall be in accordance with the provisions of building and construction codes as currently adopted by the city. No additional setback or other requirements are necessary to regulate structural design. 

b. Critical facilities shall not be located in seismic or tsunami hazard areas unless mitigation is provided that renders the proposed development as stable as if it were not located within a seismic/tsunami hazard area.

c. Building plans for development within tsunami hazard areas or liquefaction prone areas shall include a note indicating the plans are being made in a tsunami hazard/liquefaction prone area.

2. Standards for Landslide and Erosion Hazard Areas. Development in landslide or erosion hazard areas shall comply with the following performance standards:

a. Stormwater Control.

i. Within all landslide and erosion hazard areas, the applicant must demonstrate that the temporary and final improvements to control runoff water quality, erosion, and sedimentation incorporate source controls, best management practices, and treatment and degradation controls that will not aggravate an existing problem or cause a new problem to occur.

ii. Surface drainage shall be directed away from landslide and erosion hazard areas. When no other solution is practicable, surface drainage piping may be located on the face of a geologically hazardous area when contained in a tight line (closed, nonleaking pipe) and in such a way that erosion will not be exacerbated.

b. Erosion Control.

i. Development within landslide and erosion hazard areas shall require a special report specifying detailed erosion control measures, which must be in place following the preconstruction meeting and approved prior to clearing and grading.

ii. Clearing of vegetation is allowed only within the dry season (generally from May 1st through September 30th), unless specifically approved by the director where conditions warrant such an allowance and the risk of hazard is controlled; clearing shall not occur until a permit or other written authority is obtained.

iii. The face of cut and fill on slopes shall be prepared and maintained to control against erosion and instability through utilization of surface mulches or rapid revegetation activities.

iv. The proposal shall not increase the rate of surface water discharge or sedimentation and shall not decrease adjacent property slope stability.

c. Preservation of Vegetation.

i. Whenever practicable, existing vegetation in these areas should remain in an undisturbed condition. If the area is unvegetated due to a previous disturbance, immediate efforts may be required to provide a persistent native vegetative cover, to prevent erosion or hazard.

ii. To minimize impacts to critical areas and on-site vegetation, the city may require clearing plans to be designed to minimize impacts to soil and understory vegetation by providing for sequencing and staging.

d. Development Design.

i. All development proposals shall be designed to minimize the footprint of building and other disturbed areas within landslide or erosion hazard areas. Common access drives and utility corridors are required where practicable; and 

ii. All development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage (e.g., under structure parking, multilevel structures, etc.); and

iii. Structures shall be clustered where possible to reduce disturbance and maintain natural topographic character; and 

iv. Structures shall conform to natural contour of slope and foundations should be tiered where possible to conform to existing topography of site; and

v. Roads, walkways and parking areas should be designed to parallel the natural contours; and 

vi. Access shall be in the least sensitive area of the site; and 

vii. Construction of private or public utility corridors may be allowed in landslide and erosion hazard areas only when no viable alternative exists; provided, that a special study accepted by the director concludes the development will not increase the risk of landslide or accelerated erosion. 

e. Landscaping Design.

i. A site mitigation plan shall be prepared in accordance with PTMC 19.05.060(D)(6), unless waived by the director. 

ii. The disturbed area of a development site shall be landscaped to provide long-term erosion control. 

iii. Landscape plantings should encourage the use of drought-tolerant native vegetation such as those described in the Department of Fish and Wildlife’s “Plants for Wildlife in Western Washington.” 

iv. All landscaping must be completed in landslide and erosion hazard areas before a development will receive a final inspection.

f. Additional Standards for Landslide Areas.

i. All proposed development on geologically hazardous areas and marine bluffs greater than 40 percent that exceed a vertical height of 10 feet and their required buffers shall be prohibited, except if allowed under PTMC 19.05.040(B) and (E), or for minor development to provide public access (e.g., public trails, stairs or view points); when the special study concludes that doing so would not result in an increased risk to people or property or impacts to environmental processes.

ii. Marine Bluffs. A special study shall be required for all proposed development occurring within the “marine bluff management zone,” as dictated by the bluff height and defined from the top of the slope:

	Bluff Height	Marine Bluff Management zone

	Less than 10 feet	No management zone

	10 – 50 feet	50-foot management zone

	51 – 100 feet	Equal to the height of the bluff

	Greater than 100 feet	100-foot

Figure 19.05.100(A) Marine Bluffs
[IMAGE]


iii. Inland Banks. All proposed development occurring within 50 feet of the top of an inland bank classified as a landslide or erosion hazard area shall require preparation of a special study. This area shall hereinafter be referred to as the “inland bank management zone.”

Figure 19.05.100(B) Inland Banks
[IMAGE]


iv. Within the marine bluff and inland bank management zones set forth in this section, a buffer shall be established and maintained as set forth in subsection F of this section.

v. Alterations occurring within 25 feet of the toe of landslide hazard areas must conform to specific recommendations in the special study.

F. Buffers and Setbacks.

1. Licensed Engineering Geologist Recommends Buffer Subject to Minimum. Within the management zones established for marine bluffs and inland banks under subsections (E)(2)(f)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the buffer width shall be established by an approved special study prepared by an engineering geologist with a Washington specialty license in engineering geology as specified in Chapter 18.220 RCW. The report shall be based upon the best available science, existing and proposed uses, risks of slope failure, and coastal erosion rates, if applicable. The recommended buffer shall be based on site-specific conditions and proposed design. In no case shall the buffer be less than the minimum buffers established by this section and/or the shoreline master program as applicable.

2. Minimum Buffer for New Land Division. Unless otherwise excepted in subsection (F)(3) of this section, for new short plats, subdivisions, binding site plans, and PUDs, a minimum buffer of 50 feet shall be provided from the edge of all marine bluffs, and 25 feet from inland banks; provided, that a reduction in the required buffer width to a distance equal to the height of the slope may be permitted when the special study concludes that doing so would not result in an increased risk to people or property or impacts to environmental processes. Erosion rates measured over at least a 75-year period shall be evaluated in any special study recommending a buffer width less than the applicable minimum. Under no circumstance may the buffer width for a marine bluff be less than a distance equal to the sum of the bluff erosion rate over at least 75 years plus 20 feet from the crest or 10 feet from the toe. (Also see PTMC 19.05.060(D)(3), Land Divisions – Building Pad.)

3. Minimum Buffer for Existing Lots and Infill Subdivisions. For existing lots, and infill subdivisions creating no additional waterfront lots, a landslide hazard area buffer less than that required for new subdivisions under subsection (F)(2) of this section may be permitted to allow development of a single-family residence; if the special study concludes that doing so would not result in an increased risk to people or property or impacts to environmental processes. Additionally, for proposals within the shoreline jurisdiction, the reduced buffer width shall not be less than a distance equal to the sum of the bluff erosion rate over at least 75 years plus 20 feet from the crest; or 10 feet from the sides and the toe of a marine bluff (DR 6.8.1 of the shoreline master program). (Also see PTMC 19.05.060(D)(3), Land Divisions – Building Pad.)

4. Building setback lines shall be measured from the outside edge of required buffers and no setback shall be less than 15 feet from an established marine bluff or inland bank buffer.

5. Remodels and/or additions to nonconforming structures (including new decks) shall be subject to the following:

a. A minor remodel or addition that neither changes an existing foundation line (i.e., no site alterations) nor increases the existing square footage of a structure by more than 25 percent shall not require preparation of a special study;

b. A remodel or addition that involves site alterations with an estimated cost of less than 50 percent of the market value of the existing structure shall require preparation of a special study, and shall be conditioned to locate new improvements away from identified hazard areas;

c. A remodel or addition that involves site alterations with an estimated cost of 50 percent or more of the market value of the existing structure shall be subject to the requirements applicable to new development. Such proposals shall also meet the view protection standards of the SMP.

6. Except as otherwise specified, buffer zones shall be retained in their natural condition. Where buffer disturbance has occurred during construction or in violation of this chapter, revegetation with native vegetation will be required unless the director approves a substitute vegetation with the same or better mitigation characteristics.

G. Special Reports. For geologically hazardous slopes, erosion hazard areas, and landslide hazard areas, unless waived by the director, a licensed engineering geologist shall complete a field investigation and geological assessment to determine whether or not the site for the proposed activity is located within 200 feet of the geologic hazard. The geological assessment shall be submitted in the most applicable form as follows:

1. A Geological Letter. When the geologist or geotechnical professional finds that no hazard area exists within 200 feet of the site, a stamped letter may be submitted demonstrating those findings; 

2. A Geological Report. When the geologist finds that a geologically hazardous area exists within 200 feet of the site, but will not impact the site or need engineering design recommendations; 

3. A Geotechnical Report. When the licensed engineering geologist finds that a geologically hazardous area exists within 200 feet of the site, and will require engineering design recommendations or other mitigation measures necessary in order to construct or develop within the geologically hazardous area. The report shall be stamped and signed by the LEG and co-sealed by an engineer who has a valid Washington State engineering license as specified in Chapter 18.43 RCW with appropriate training and experience for the proposed engineered design mitigation. For engineered mitigation measures on marine shorelines, the engineer shall have the appropriate training and experience in coastal processes. (Ord. 3198 § 3 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3062 §§ 12, 13, 14, 2011; Ord. 2982 §§ 15, 16, 2008; Ord. 2899 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2867 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2319 § 1, 1992). 


19.05.110 Critical area 5 – Wetlands.

A. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to protect the public from harm by preserving the functions of wetlands and streams as recharge for ground water, flood storage, floodwater conveyance, habitat for fish and wildlife, sediment control, pollution control, surface water supply, aquifer recharge and recreation.

B. Classification. 

1. Designated wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Designated wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Designated wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Designated wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to compensate for wetland impacts, including conversion of wetlands.

2. Designated wetland areas have been identified by:

a. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Wetlands Inventory;

b. Wetlands identified within the land use/land cover inventories of the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas;

c. Department of Ecology Washington Coastal (Floating) Kelp Resources;

d. Hydric soils, soils with significant soil inclusions, and “wet spots” identified within the Jefferson County soil survey; 

e. City of Port Townsend inventories and delineations, existing and as hereinafter amended.

3. For the purposes of a general inventory, wetlands will be defined in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements.

4. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (2014) or as revised by Ecology.

a. Category I. Category I wetlands are:

i. Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

ii. Wetlands that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR as wetlands of high conservation value;

iii. Bogs;

iv. Mature and old growth forested wetlands larger than one acre;

v. Wetlands in coastal lagoons;

vi. Interdunal wetlands that score eight or nine points for habitat, and are larger than one acre; and

vii. Wetlands that score 23 points or more on the questions relating to functions.

b. Category II. Category II wetlands are:

i. Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

ii. Wetlands that score between 20 and 22 points on the questions related to the functions present; or

iii. Interdunal wetlands larger than one acre and that score seven or lower for habitat, or those found in a mosaic of wetlands and dunes larger than one acre.

c. Category III. Category III wetlands are:

i. Wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scores between 16 and 19 points); and

ii. Interdunal wetlands between one-tenth of an acre and one acre in size.

d. Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scores less than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that are capable of being replaced, and in some cases improved. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected.

C. Regulated Development.

1. Regulated wetlands include all Category I and II wetlands, and all Category III and IV wetlands.

2. Regulated wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of construction of a road, street or highway. These wetlands are considered to be facilities and require maintenance. At such a time when these facilities are not maintained for a period of more than five years, yet still retain wetland characteristics, they revert to regulated wetland status if they meet the parameters of the regulated wetland definition.

3. If a wetlands delineation is required, it must be conducted by a qualified (wetlands) critical areas consultant in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements.

a. Prior to construction, the applicant shall mark and provide a certified survey for the edges of the wetland on the site. See PTMC 19.05.040(F)(1)(j).

b. Where the applicant has provided a delineation of the wetland boundary, the director shall verify the accuracy of, and may render adjustments to, the boundary delineation. In the event the adjusted boundary delineation is contested by the applicant, the director shall, at the applicant’s expense, obtain expert services from a third party to render a final delineation.

c. The director, when requested by the applicant, may perform the delineation in lieu of delineation by the applicant.

i. The director shall consult with qualified professional scientists and technical experts or other experts as needed to perform the delineation.

ii. The applicant will be charged for the costs incurred.

D. Performance Standards for Development.

1. Activities and uses shall be prohibited in wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this subsection. A critical areas report may be required to support the requested activity and, where impacts cannot be avoided, mitigation provided in accordance with this section.

2. Category I Wetlands. Activities and uses that result in alteration of Category I wetlands and their buffers shall be prohibited except as provided for in PTMC 19.05.040(B), Exemptions, 19.05.050, exceptions, and subsection (D)(5) of this section.

3. Category II and III Wetlands. Except as specified in subsection (D)(5) of this section, for Category II and III wetlands and their buffers, the following standards shall apply:

a. Water-dependent activities may be allowed where there are no practicable alternatives that would have a less adverse impact on the wetland, its buffers and other critical areas, and where the use meets the intent of this chapter.

b. Non-water-dependent activities and uses shall be prohibited unless the applicant can demonstrate that:

i. The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished on another site or sites in the general region while still successfully avoiding or resulting in less adverse impact on a wetland; and

ii. All on-site alternative designs that would avoid or result in less adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer, such as a reduction in the size, scope, configuration or density of the project, are not feasible.

Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of wetland and buffers shall be provided under the terms established under subsection H of this section.

4. Category IV Wetlands (Except Small Hydrologically Isolated Wetlands (see Subsection (D)(5) of This Section)). Activities and uses that result in unavoidable impacts may be permitted in Category IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area report and compensatory mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives. Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of wetland and buffers shall be provided under the terms established under subsection H of this section.

5. Exemptions from Avoidance Requirement. The director may exempt the following wetlands from the requirement to avoid impacts (PTMC 19.05.060(A)), and these wetlands may be filled if the impacts are fully mitigated based on subsection (H)(2)(b) through (e) of this section. If available, impacts should be mitigated through the purchase of credits from an in-lieu fee program or mitigation bank. In order to verify the following conditions, a critical area report for wetlands meeting the requirements of this chapter must be submitted:

a. All isolated Category IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet in area that:

i. Are not associated with riparian areas or their buffers;

ii. Are not associated with shorelines of the state or their associated buffers;

iii. Are not part of a wetland mosaic;

iv. Do not score five or more points for habitat function based on the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology);

v. Do not contain a priority habitat or a priority area for a priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat, or species of local importance identified in PTMC 19.05.080(B).

b. Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet that meet the above criteria and do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions in this chapter.

6. Stormwater Management. The following surface water management activities may be allowed only if they meet the following requirements:

a. Category I, II, III, and IV wetlands and buffers may be used for regional retention/detention facilities only when all applicable requirements of the EDS manual are met, the use will not adversely affect the rating or the factors used in rating the wetland, the proposal is in compliance with the management guidelines set forth in the stormwater management manual, and there are no significant adverse impacts to wetland resources.

b. New developments cannot use existing wetlands for surface water discharge unless the wetlands are protected by upstream treatment facilities that demonstrate runoff, erosion, water quality, and sedimentation control.

c. New surface water discharges to wetlands from detention facilities, presettlement ponds, or other surface water management structures may be allowed; if the discharge does not increase the rate of flow nor decrease the water quality of the wetland.

d. Wetlands shall not be used for stormwater management purposes only for individual properties. Wetlands used for retention/detention facilities must serve as neighborhood or regional facilities.

e. Use of wetland buffers for stormwater management facilities such as retention/detention facilities or energy dissipaters may be allowed only if the applicant demonstrates:

i. No practicable alternative exists; and

ii. Facilities are limited to dispersion outfalls and bioswales located, to the extent practicable, in the outer 25 percent of wetland buffers; and

iii. The functions of the buffer or wetland are not adversely impacted.

E. Trails and Trail-Related Facilities. Construction of public and publicly accessible private trails and trail-related facilities (e.g., benches and viewing platforms) may be allowed in wetlands or wetland buffers provided such facilities shall meet all of the following criteria:

1. Trails and related facilities shall, to the extent practicable, be placed on existing road grades, utility corridors, or any other previously disturbed areas.

2. Trails and related facilities shall be planned to minimize removal of trees, soil disturbance and existing hydrological characteristics, shrubs, snags and important wildlife habitat.

3. Viewing platforms, interpretive centers, benches and access to them shall be designed and located to minimize disturbance of wildlife habitat and/or critical characteristics of the affected wetland. Platforms shall be limited to 100 square feet in size, unless demonstrated through a wetland mitigation plan that a larger structure will not result in a net loss of wetland functions.

4. Trails and related facilities shall generally be located outside required buffers. Where trails are permitted within buffers they shall be located in the outer 25 percent of the buffer except where wetland crossings or direct access to viewing areas have been approved by the department.

5. Trails shall generally be limited to pedestrian use unless other more intensive uses, such as bike or horse trails, have been specifically allowed and mitigation has been provided. Trail width shall not exceed five feet unless there is a demonstrated need, subject to review and approval by the department. Trails shall be constructed with pervious materials except where determined impracticable.

F. Utilities. Unless otherwise exempt per PTMC 19.05.040(B), placement of utilities under a wetland or within a wetland buffer may be allowed when no reasonable alternative location is available; provided, that:

1. Entrance/exit portals are located outside of the wetland buffer boundary to the extent practicable;

2. Drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column is disturbed;

3. New utility corridors shall be revegetated with appropriate native vegetation at not less than preconstruction densities or greater immediately upon completion of construction, or as soon thereafter as possible if due to seasonal growing constraints. The utility shall ensure that such vegetation survives; and

4. The utility shall agree to conduct corridor maintenance in a manner that protects the regulated wetland and buffer environment. Measures may include but are not limited to: 

a. Spray painting or sandblasting of utility equipment may only be allowed if appropriate containment measures are used. Lead-based paints shall not be used.

b. No pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers may be used in wetland areas or their buffers except those approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Washington Department of Ecology. Where approved, federal, state, and local regulations of pesticides and water quality must be followed, including requirements for pesticide applicator licensing from the Washington State Department of Agriculture.

G. Buffers and Setbacks.

1. Wetland buffers shall be measured perpendicularly from the wetland boundary as delineated in the field (see the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements).

2. Buffers shall be required to protect important wildlife habitat and wetland features, values and functions from the adverse impacts of adjacent land uses.

a. The width of the buffer zone shall be based upon wetland category, intensity of impacts, and wetland functions or special characteristics, as set forth below:

3. Any wetland created, restored or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall also include the standard buffer required for the wetland category. 

4. Increased Buffer Zone Widths. The director may increase standard buffer zone widths on a case-by-case basis when the director determines:

a. A larger buffer is necessary to maintain viable populations of existing species; or

b. The wetland is used by species proposed or listed by the federal government or the state as endangered, threatened and priority species, or having outstanding potential habitat for those species, or having unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or 

c. The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse impacts; or

d. The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than 15 percent.

5. Reduced Buffer Widths. The director may reduce the standard buffer width on a case-by-case basis to a width of no fewer than 25 feet when the director determines that:

a. No direct, indirect, short-term, or long-term adverse impacts to regulated wetlands will result from the proposed development activity; or 

b. The site is extensively vegetated and has less than 15 percent slopes; or 

c. The project contains provisions to enhance buffers using native vegetation which will provide additional protection for the wetland’s functions and values.

6. Buffer Width Averaging. Standard buffer zones may be modified by averaging buffer widths. Width averaging shall be allowed only where the applicant demonstrates all of the following: 

a. That width averaging will not adversely impact the functions and values; and 

b. That the total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging; 

c. In no instance shall the buffer width be reduced by more than 50 percent of the standard buffer or be less than 25 feet.

7. Buffer Waivers. Application of the buffers set forth in this section may be waived by the director in instances where either of the following findings are made:

a. The parcel to be developed lies landward of an existing and substantial structural development on an intervening lot which separates the parcel from the wetland and has effectively eliminated the function and value to be derived from the required buffer width; or

b. The parcel to be developed lies landward of an existing legally established roadway or other legally established structure or paved area 16 feet or more in width which separates the parcel from the wetland and has effectively eliminated the function and value to be derived from the required buffer width.

8. Except as otherwise specified, buffer zones shall be retained in their natural condition. Where buffer disturbance has occurred during construction or in violation of this chapter, revegetation with native vegetation will be required unless the director approves a substitute vegetation with the same or better mitigation characteristics.

9. Building setback lines shall be measured from the outside edge of required buffers and no setback shall be less than 15 feet from an established wetland buffer.

H. Compensatory Mitigation Requirements.

1. Unless otherwise provided in this section, compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands may be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be: 

a. Consistent with the Draft Guidance on Wetlands Mitigation in Washington State, Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans, 2006 (Washington State Department of Ecology, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Seattle District, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Publication No. 06-06-011b, or as revised).

b. Consistent with mitigation ratios in subsection (H)(7) of this section.

2. Mitigation shall be required in the following order of preference:

a. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

b. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

c. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

d. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations; or

e. Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments.

3. Compensation for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when:

a. The lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by site-specific function assessment, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

b. Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions, where permitted, will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

4. Preference of Compensatory Mitigation Actions. Mitigation actions that require compensation shall be required in the following order of preference:

a. Restoration (re-establishment and rehabilitation) of wetlands;

b. Creation (establishment) of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species; this should only be attempted when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is anticipated in the design; and

c. Enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation; such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

5. Type and location of mitigation shall comply with PTMC 19.05.060(C) and (D).

6. Timing of Compensatory Mitigation. Compensation projects shall be completed prior to activities that will disturb the on-site wetlands. The director may allow compensatory mitigation to be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife and flora. The director may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the temporary compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland consultant as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (e.g., project delay lapses past a fisheries window; or plant installation should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survivability of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. The request for temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the city.

7. Wetland Mitigation Ratios. In approving alteration or creation of a wetland or wetland buffer, the director shall require that an area larger than the altered portion of the wetland or wetland buffer be provided as compensation for loss of the functions of the altered wetland and to assure that such functional values are replaced. The following ratios (Table 19.05.110(B)) are the presumptive requirement for compensatory mitigation. The applicant may propose different ratios and must support the proposed ratios with a wetland mitigation plan that demonstrates how the proposal achieves functional equivalency or improved wetland functions. In no case shall the buffer mitigation ratio be less than 1:1. Mitigation requirements may be determined using the credit/debit tool described in “Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Operational Draft” (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, February 2011, or as revised).

 

	Table 19.05.110(B). Mitigation Ratios

	Category and Type of Wetland	Re-establishment or Creation	Rehabilitation**	1:1 Re-establishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E)	Enhancement Only

	All Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	6:1

	All Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 R/C and 4:1 E	8:1

	Category II – Estuarine	Case-by-case	4:1 Rehabilitation of an estuarine wetland	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

	Category II – Interdunal	2:1 Compensation must be interdunal wetland	4:1 Compensation must be interdunal wetland	Not considered an option***	Not considered an option***

	All Other Category II	3:1	6:1	1:1 R/C and 8:1 E	12:1

	Category I – Forested	6:1	12:1	1:1 R/C and 20:1 E	24:1

	Category I Based on Score for Functions	4:1	8:1	1:1 R/C and 12:1 E	16:1

	Category I Natural Heritage Site	Not considered possible*	6:1 Rehabilitation of a Natural Heritage site	Not considered possible*	Case-by-case

	Category I – Coastal Lagoon	Not considered possible*	6:1 Rehabilitation of a coastal lagoon	Not considered possible*	Case-by-case

	Category I – Bog	Not considered possible*	6:1 Rehabilitation of a bog	Not considered possible*	Case-by-case

	Category I – Estuarine	Case-by-case	6:1 Rehabilitation of an estuarine wetland	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

*    Natural Heritage sites, coastal lagoons, and bogs are considered irreplaceable wetlands, and therefore no amount of compensation would replace these ecosystems. Avoidance is the best option. In the rare cases when impacts cannot be avoided, replacement ratios will be assigned on a case-by-case basis. However, these ratios will be significantly higher than the other ratios for Category I wetlands.

**    Rehabilitation ratios are based on the assumption that actions judged to be most effective for that site are being implemented.

***    Due to the dynamic nature of interdunal systems, enhancement is not considered an ecologically appropriate action.

8. Preservation. Impacts to wetlands and wetland buffers may be mitigated by preservation of wetland areas when used in combination with other forms of mitigation such as creation, restoration, or enhancement at the preservation site or at a separate location. Preservation may also be used by itself, but more restrictions apply as outlined below.

a. Preservation in Combination with Other Forms of Compensation. Using preservation as a compensation is acceptable when done in combination with restoration; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by restoration or creation and the criteria below are met:

i. The impact area is small, and/or impacts are to a Category III or IV wetland;

ii. Preservation of a high quality system occurs in the following order of preference as the wetland impact: first, the same city drainage basin; second, within the city limits; and third, within the same water resource inventory area (WRIA);

iii. Preservation sites include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation; and

iv. Mitigation ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation shall range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the quality of the wetlands being mitigated and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.

b. Preservation as the Sole Means of Compensation for Wetland Impacts. Preservation of at-risk, high quality habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when all of the following criteria are met:

i. Preservation is used as a form of compensation only     after the standard sequencing of mitigation (i.e., avoid, minimize, and then compensate) has been applied;

ii. Creation, restoration, and enhancement opportunities have also been considered, and preservation is the best mitigation option;

iii. The impact area is small and/or impacts are to a Category III or IV wetland;

iv. Preservation of a high quality system occurs in the following order of preference: first, the same city drainage basin; second, within the city limits; and third, within the same water resource inventory area (WRIA);

v. Preservation sites include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation;

vi. The preservation site is determined to be under imminent threat, specifically, sites with the potential to experience a high rate of undesirable ecological change due to on-site activities (note: “potential” includes permitted, planned, or likely actions that are not adequately protected under existing regulations (e.g., logging of forested wetlands));

vii. The area proposed for preservation is of high quality and critical for the health of the watershed or basin. Some of the following features may be indicative of high quality sites: (A) Category I or II wetland rating; (B) rare wetland type (e.g., bogs, mature forested wetlands, estuaries); (C) habitat for threatened or endangered species; (D) wetland type that is rare in the area; (E) provides biological and/or hydrological connectivity; (F) high regional or watershed importance (e.g., listed as priority site in watershed plan); (G) large size with high species diversity (plants and/or animals) and/or high abundance; and

viii. Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20:1. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost.

9. Wetland Mitigation Banks. 

a. Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:

i. The bank is certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC;

ii. The director determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

iii. The proposed use of credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

b. Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

c. Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, bank service areas may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions, and such areas may encompass a portion or all of more than one political jurisdiction.

I. Wetland Mitigation/Compensation Plan Requirements. When wetland alteration is permitted by this chapter, a mitigation plan shall be required to describe the methods the applicant will use to minimize impacts to wetland functions and values. A detailed mitigation plan shall be approved by the director prior to any development activity occurring on a lot upon which wetland or wetland buffer alteration, restoration, creation or enhancement is proposed. The mitigation plan shall be prepared by a qualified (wetlands) critical area consultant using accepted methodologies, shall include information as required by the director, and shall: 

1. Include a baseline study that quantifies the existing functions and values of the wetland, the function and values that will be lost due to compensation, and the functions and values of the wetland to be created, restored or enhanced; and

2. Specify how functions and values will be preserved or replaced; and how impacts will be avoided, minimized or compensated for; and 

3. Establish goals and objectives for the mitigation plan; and

4. Specify within the mitigation plan written specifications for grading, sedimentation and erosion control, revegetation, hydraulic analysis, staging of construction areas, appropriate diagrams and drawings, and recommended construction practices; and

5. Specify quantified criteria for monitoring the mitigated area on a long-term basis to determine whether the goals and objectives of the project have been met; and 

6. Include a contingency plan specifying what corrective actions will be taken should the mitigation not be successful; and

7. Include provisions for maintenance bonding or other security acceptable to the director to assure that work is completed in accordance with the mitigation plan and that restoration or rehabilitation is performed in accordance with the contingency plan if mitigation fails within five years of implementation.

J. Performance Bonds and Demonstration of Competence.

1. A demonstration of financial resources, administrative, supervisory and technical competence and scientific expertise of sufficient standing to successfully execute the compensation project shall be provided by the applicant.

2. A compensation project manager shall be named and the qualifications of each team member involved in preparing the mitigation plan and implementing and supervising the project shall be provided, including educational background and areas of expertise, training and experience with comparable projects. 

3. Bonds or other security acceptable to the director ensuring fulfillment of the compensation project, monitoring program, and any contingency measure shall be posted in the amount of 120 percent of the expected cost of compensation.

K. Special Reports. The following special reports shall be provided either separately or as one comprehensive report. Contents and methods may be more fully detailed in the procedures manual that may be adopted administratively:

1. The Wetlands Delineation Report and Certified Boundary Survey. The purpose of the report is to convey to the reviewer a factual picture of the extent and location of wetlands at a given site. The report is to include filed data sheets, an accurate map of the site that includes the wetland boundaries and location of all data collection points, and narrative that explains the delineator’s approach to collecting data in addition to their syntheses of data.

2. Wetlands Special Report. An assessment of anticipated impacts (direct, indirect, and cumulative) and mitigation measures necessary to comply with the city’s requirement to achieve no net loss to wetland functions and values. 

3. Assessment of the Compensatory Mitigation Site. This report is required when compensatory mitigation and restoration plans call for the alteration of existing wetland habitat. The report includes an assessment of the suitability of the site for compensatory mitigation or restoration, an evaluation of, and anticipated impacts to, existing wetland functions and values, proposed alterations and their anticipated effects upon functions and values, and a description of how the proposed compensatory mitigation or restoration plan conforms with the city’s requirement to achieve no net loss of wetland functions and values.

Article I. General Provisions


19.06.010 Purpose.

A. Promote the preservation and growth of healthy, vigorous trees in the city of Port Townsend. The known benefits associated with trees and tree cover include, but are not limited to, the filtration of groundwater; the reduction of surface water runoff; flood control; the provision of fish and wildlife habitat; the maintenance of water quality; the cleansing of the air; the abatement of noise; and the conservation of energy.

B. Recognize that healthy older trees provide substantially more canopy and benefits than newly planted trees.

C. Acknowledge that Port Townsend is an established urban growth area and as such is an appropriate location for urban level development. 

D. Recognize that the indiscriminate removal of trees and tree cover prior to project permit approval poses a threat to the city of Port Townsend’s environmental quality, aesthetic character, and quality of life enjoyed by its residents. Where land clearing is the first step in converting a site to a nonforestry use, require the retention of some existing trees so that they may be incorporated into the final site development. 

E. On lots less than 40,000 square feet containing existing homes, individual homeowners will be allowed to choose and manage their own landscaping without the necessity of obtaining permits under this chapter. The city will endeavor to offer educational opportunities to homeowners on proper tree care. Larger lots that meet minimum tree conservation standards shall also be exempt from this chapter. 

F. Allow thinning of forested properties to improve overall tree health by retaining the most vigorous trees and harvesting overcrowded and less desirable trees. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.020 Applicability.

This chapter applies to the removal or topping of trees in the city limits of Port Townsend and is organized into the following sections:

A. Article I, General Provisions, contains introduction and definitions and general provisions that apply to the remainder of this chapter. 

B. Article II, Tree Conservation Permit Approvals, provides permitting requirements and standards for certain tree removal activities including predevelopment logging and thinning. It is the intent of Article II to allow the city to comply with RCW 76.09.240 which requires cities and counties to assume jurisdiction over Class IV – General forest practices. Where an applicant is also applying for a concurrent development project such as a commercial site plan, multifamily project, residential subdivision, etc., these activities which require separate permit approval are exempt from the requirement of obtaining a “tree conservation permit” subject to complying with the “tree conservation standards” of Article III as part of their other project permit approvals (commercial site plan approval, multifamily design review, preliminary plat approval, etc.). Article II also addresses tree removal on developed properties while allowing broad exemptions for single-family residences on existing lots, conditional exemptions for single-family residences on large lots (over 40,000 square feet), exemptions for hazard tree removal, and qualified exemptions for tree removal on developed commercial, mixed use, and multifamily residential sites. 

C. Article III, Standards for Tree Conservation, establishes minimum standards for tree conservation required for projects that require tree conservation permits, or for projects that normally require landscaping plans (such as commercial site plans, subdivisions, multifamily design review, etc.). Article III does not create a separate permit process but rather establishes the standards for tree conservation, tree protection during development or tree removal activities, and tree selection and planting for new trees. These standards are intended to augment existing landscaping standards contained in the Port Townsend Municipal Code and provide incentives for tree retention during project development and clear and consistent standards for tree planting for new development projects. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.030 Relationship to Chapter 76.09 RCW.

A. The application of this chapter to forest practice activities regulated by the Washington State Forest Practices Act (Chapter 76.09 RCW) shall be limited to:

1. Class IV – General forest practices;

2. Class I forest practices within the city limits of Port Townsend that involve timber harvesting or road construction.

B. This chapter is intended to allow the city of Port Townsend to assume jurisdiction for approval of Class IV – General forest practices approvals, hereinafter referred to as “tree conservation permit approvals,” occurring in the city of Port Townsend, as authorized under the Washington State Forest Practices Act, Chapter 76.09 RCW. Until such time as jurisdiction for these permits is transferred to the city by the State Department of Natural Resources, the city will act as the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) lead agency for all Class IV – General forest practice approvals occurring within the city limits. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.040 Definitions. 

In addition to the following definitions, this chapter shall rely upon existing definitions contained within the Washington State Forest Practices Act (Chapter 76.09 RCW), Rules for the Washington State Forest Practices Act (Chapter 222-16 WAC), and the Port Townsend Municipal Code. 

A. “Canopy area” means the area covered by the crown of an individual tree as delineated by the vertical projection of its outermost perimeter. Small openings in the crown are included. 

B. “Canopy cover” means the percentage of property area covered by the sum canopy area of the trees to be retained on the site post-development as delineated by the vertical projection of its outermost perimeter of the tree branches. Small openings in the canopy are included. 

C. “Co-dominant trees” means trees whose crowns form the general level of the canopy cover and receive full light from above, but limited light from the sides. 

D. “Contiguous” means having a common border with, but not separated from, such common border by a public right-of-way.

K. “Diseased tree” means a tree that, in the opinion of the city of Port Townsend DSD or an expert approved by the city of Port Townsend (such as, but not limited to, an experienced forester, certified arborist, or landscape architect), has a strong likelihood of infecting other vegetation in the area or becoming a hazard as a result of the disease.

L. “Dominant trees” means trees whose crowns are higher than the general level of the canopy and which receive light from the sides as well as from above. 

M. “Environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs),” also defined as “critical areas” by the Washington State Growth Management Act. These environmentally sensitive areas in Port Townsend are geologically hazardous areas, frequently flooded areas and critical drainage corridors, wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and are regulated by Chapter 19.05 PTMC.

N. “Forest land” as defined in the Washington State Forest Practices Act means all land that is capable of supporting a merchantable stand of timber and is not actively used for a use which is incompatible with timber growing.

O. “Forest practice” means any activity conducted on or directly pertaining to forest land and relating to the growing, harvesting, or processing of timber, including, but not limited to: road and trail construction; harvesting, final and intermediate; site preparation prior to development involving tree removal; precommercial thinning; reforestation; fertilization; prevention and suppression of diseases and insects; salvage of trees; and brush control. 

P. “Hazard tree” shall mean any tree which, in the opinion of the city of Port Townsend DSD or an expert approved by the city of Port Townsend (such as, but not limited to, a professional forester, certified arborist, or landscape architect), poses an unreasonable risk of failure and is a distance of one and one-half tree length or less from a permanent structure or high use outdoor area.

Q. “Intermediate trees” means trees that are generally surrounded by other trees and whose crowns generally receive no sunlight from the sides but do receive some direct sunlight from above through holes in the tree canopy. 

R. “Limbing” means the act of removing unwanted limbs, or branches, from a tree. For example, limbing may be used to remove large branches hanging dangerously over a house without removing the whole tree. 

S. “Lot” means a designated parcel, tract or area of land established by plat, subdivision, or as otherwise permitted by law, to be separately owned, used, developed, or built upon.

T. “Native trees” means trees that are indigenous to the Olympic Peninsula. DSD will maintain a list of native trees. 

U. “Nuisance tree” shall mean any tree which, in the opinion of the city of Port Townsend DSD or an expert approved by the city of Port Townsend (such as, but not limited to, a professional forester, certified arborist, or landscape architect), is an invasive variety, is an allergen, or due to its location is causing or is likely to cause significant damage to a permanent structure that cannot be mitigated without removal of the tree. 

V. “Priority trees” means existing trees with a diameter of 24 inches or greater, or that are at least 100 years old, or provide significant habitat value. These trees are given high priority for retention per this chapter.

W. “Project permit” or “project permit application” means any land use or environmental permit or license required from the city for a project action, including but not limited to subdivisions, planned unit developments, conditional uses, shoreline substantial development permits, permits or approvals required by the critical area ordinance (Chapter 19.05 PTMC), site-specific rezones authorized by the Port Townsend comprehensive plan or a formally adopted subarea plan. 

X. “Suppressed trees” means trees that receive no direct sunlight from the sides or above due to surrounding tree canopy. May receive limited filtered sunlight. Generally weak and slow growing. 

Y. “Topping” means a pruning cut to the main stem of a mature tree. Such cuts can result in serious decay and/or forcing out growth of weakly attached upright sprouts below the cut. Topping also results in permanent alteration of tree architecture. For the purposes of this chapter, topping shall be treated the same as tree removal. 

Z. “Tree” means any woody plant commonly having one main stem or trunk topped by a foliage canopy that will reach a minimum height of 20 feet at maturity. 

AA. “Tree protection area” means a protective zone established around the canopy area of a tree or tree stand to prevent damage or destruction during construction and site development activities. 

BB. “Tree unit” is a measurement to give value to the number of trees retained on a site. Table 19.06.120(D)(3) assigns “tree unit credits” based upon the size of existing or newly planted trees. Utilizing tree units allows larger, older trees to be given more value than younger, smaller trees. For new trees, tree units can vary for the size that the trees will reach at maturity (smaller size at maturity, fewer tree unit credits). 

CC. “Windfirm” means a tree that is capable of withstanding average peak local wind speeds and gusts without experiencing major breakage or windthrow.

DD. “Windthrow” means the uprooting or breaking of a tree due to excessive wind. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).

Article II. Tree Conservation Permit Approvals


19.06.050 Purpose.

A. This article sets forth procedures and criteria that apply to tree removal activities that are not associated with a concurrent proposal to develop the land with buildings and infrastructure or other types of urban development. This article establishes a permit process to review these tree removal activities and ensure compliance with Article III, Standards for Tree Conservation. For tree removal activities that are proposed as part of a development project, see Article III, Standards for Tree Conservation. 

B. To promote tree conservation, encourage the submittal of development proposals concurrent with proposals for tree removal activities.

C. Where tree removal is proposed without a concurrent development proposal, the amount of tree retention should be increased to preserve flexibility for incorporating tree retention into any future development proposal.

D. Encourage tree thinning as a way to promote healthy urban forests while allowing the harvest of overcrowded trees.

E. Allow exemptions for tree removal associated with an approved project permit, residential landscaping and other small-scale tree removal activities, the removal of hazard and diseased trees, or the replacement of undesirable trees. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.060 Exemptions.

The following activities are exempt from the provisions of this chapter, provided no part of the tree removal activity lies within an environmentally sensitive area (excluding aquifer recharge areas) or its buffer:

A. Tree Removal Associated with an Approved Project Permit or to Establish a Permitted or Conditionally Permitted Use. The removal of trees associated with an approved project permit, including but not limited to building permits, design review permits, binding site plans, preliminary plats, or other project permits which authorize the installation of utilities and construction of buildings; or the establishment of a permitted or conditionally permitted use per PTMC Title 17, Zoning, provided such proposals comply with Article III, Standards for Tree Conservation. 

B. Residential Landscaping and Yard Maintenance on Lots 40,000 Square Feet or Less in Size. Removal of any tree on a lot currently zoned residential (R-I, R-II, R-III, or R-IV) containing an existing single-family residence (including duplex, triplex, or fourplex), where the lot and all contiguous lots under the same ownership, do not exceed 40,000 square feet.

1. The removal of trees with a diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of eight inches or less;

2. For trees over eight inches d.b.h., up to six healthy trees/40,000 square feet of lot area in any 12-month period. The removal of additional trees requires a written exemption pursuant to PTMC 19.06.070(C). 

D. Hazard Trees. Removal of hazardous trees, dead trees, diseased trees, or damaged trees which constitute a hazard to life or property, or adjacent trees. The removal of more than four hazard trees in any 12-month period from a single property shall require a written exemption from the DSD director, unless the tree removal is determined to be otherwise exempt from the provisions of this chapter. The applicant may be required to provide documentation by an arborist, forester, or other qualified tree professional that a tree constitutes a hazard to life or property. Hazard tree removals under this section that involve land uses or sites subject to the tree conservation standards of PTMC 19.06.120 may require replanting to ensure compliance with that chapter. 

1. Emergency Situations. Hazardous trees determined to pose an imminent threat or danger to public health or safety, or to public or private property, or serious environmental degradation may be removed by the landowner prior to receiving written approval from DSD; provided, that within 14 days following such action, the landowner shall submit a written report from a tree professional and a replanting plan if tree conservation is required by the provisions of this chapter. 

E. Tree removal activities classified as “forest practices” on lands where the landowner submits a 10-year statement of nonconversion to the Department of Natural Resources (reforestation agreement) together with either an acceptable 10-year forest management plan or proof that the land is currently enrolled in current use assessment-timber lands, under the provisions of Chapter 84.33 RCW.

F. Commercial Nurseries and Christmas Tree Farms. The removal of trees which have been grown to be sold as Christmas trees or as landscaping. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).

(Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).

Article III. Standards for Tree Conservation 


19.06.090 Purpose. 

This article sets forth procedures and standards for tree conservation and tree planting that are applicable for certain project permit approvals and predevelopment tree removal activities (listed below in PTMC 19.06.100). The retention of existing trees and, where necessary, the planting of new trees as part of certain commercial, industrial, multifamily, and land division activities are necessary to protect the environmental quality and aesthetic character of the city of Port Townsend, and quality of life enjoyed by its residents. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.100 Tree conservation plans – Applicability. 

A. The following project permit applications shall be to required to prepare a tree conservation plan as part of a complete application for that project approval, and shall carry out the tree retention and/or tree planting required by that plan consistent with this article: 

1. Residential subdivisions (10 or more lots); planned unit developments (PUDs), short plats (two to nine lots), cottage housing developments, condominium binding site plans, and commercial and industrial binding site plans;

2. Construction or additions to buildings subject to design review in the C-II general commercial, R-III and R-IV multifamily, and C-I/MU and C-II/MU mixed use zoning districts;

3. Construction of new buildings or the expansion of existing buildings by more than 10 percent in the C-I neighborhood commercial, C-II(H) hospital commercial, M-C mixed commercial/light manufacturing, P/OS(B) mixed public/infrastructure/open space, or P-I public/infrastructure zoning districts located outside the Port Townsend historic district;

4. Construction of single-family residences (including duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes) or accessory buildings, on one lot or contiguous lots under the same ownership exceeding 40,000 square feet where tree removal is proposed.

a. Such proposals shall minimize tree removal and shall comply with the tree conservation standards of PTMC 19.06.120;

b. Proposals that involve tree removal but will not comply with the tree conservation standards of PTMC 19.06.120 due to a pre-existing lack of trees, shall plant two new trees for each tree removed per the standards of PTMC 19.06.130 and the project shall be exempt from the remainder of this chapter. 

B. Tree removal activities subject to Article II of this chapter which require tree conservation permit approvals shall also prepare a tree conservation plan and implement that plan consistent with the standards of this article. 

C. Construction on properties subject to approved tree conservation plans must comply with the requirements of those plans and the provisions of this article. 

1. For example: Once a subdivision is approved, the lots within that subdivision are subject to the subdivision’s tree conservation plan. That plan may call for installation of trees at the time each lot is built upon. Therefore, home construction on a lot subject to a tree conservation plan must comply with that tree conservation plan as a condition of building permit approval. Once the home is constructed, any necessary trees installed and approved, and the building permit receives final approval, future routine landscape maintenance or tree removal activities qualify as exempt activities under Article II, PTMC 19.06.060 through 19.06.070.

D. Those project approvals not listed above are exempt from the provisions of this article. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.110 Tree conservation plans – Contents.

A. All tree conservation plans submitted pursuant to this chapter shall show the following information, if applicable:

1. Location of all improvements on the site including proposed cleared areas and/or individual trees to be removed;

2. The approximate location of any existing structures and land uses on the site including construction staging areas;

3. The location of all existing and proposed streets, rights-of-way, easements, skid roads, haul roads, and landings within the proposal;

4. Existing healthy trees to be retained including diameter (at four and one-half feet above grade), species, and location on the site or for larger projects over 40,000 square feet, canopy areas to be preserved;

5. Existing trees proposed for removal including diameter and location on the site or for larger projects over 40,000 square feet, canopy areas to be removed; 

6. Proposed new trees to be planted including species and size;

7. Tree Density Calculations. The plan shall include tree credit and/or canopy cover calculations to document compliance with PTMC 19.06.120. These calculations shall include:

a. Calculation of net site area determined by subtracting the area of public and private road rights-of-way;

b. Calculation of tree unit credits or canopy cover proposed for retention on the site excluding existing trees in adjacent opened or unopened rights-of-way; and 

c. Calculation of tree unit credits or canopy cover for newly planted trees, if applicable. 

i. Newly planted trees in rights-of-way (street trees) or alleys shall count towards tree unit requirements;

8. The location of future land development including stormwater management facilities, and vegetation to be retained for site landscaping, open space, wildlife habitat, screening, and/or buffers, to the extent known;

9. Site topography at a contour interval of 10 feet;

10. Environmental sensitive areas (ESAs) and ESA buffers regulated pursuant to Chapter 19.05 PTMC, Critical Areas;

11. Drainage ways and culverts;

12. Site area targeted for further harvest including proposed timing, if applicable; and

13. North arrow and scale shall be shown on all site plans. The scale shall be no smaller than one inch to 100 feet;

14. A watering plan is required for tree conservation plans that propose new tree plantings. The plan must provide for adequate watering of the newly installed trees at the time of planting and through the dry periods (typically May through September) for a minimum of three years. Some situations (infill in existing forested area where new trees planted in fall rainy season) may require only limited watering. 

B. Tree conservation plans shall be drawn to scale and include a north arrow. For residential subdivisions, public projects, multifamily, mixed use, and commercial projects, tree conservation plans shall be prepared by a landscape design professional, arborist, or tree service professional. 

C. Field Marking of Site Features. At the time of submittal of any application required pursuant to this title, the following features shall be clearly marked at the site with flagging or colored paint by the applicant:

1. The location of any identified critical areas and critical area buffers regulated pursuant to Chapter 19.05 PTMC, Critical Areas;

2. The centerline of all proposed access roads; and

3. Property boundaries.

D. The DSD director may waive specific tree conservation plan contents which are determined to be unnecessary for review of the particular tree removal activity. In such event, the director shall document the waiver in the project file or project log. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003). 


19.06.120 Tree conservation standards.

A. Minimum Tree Density – New Uses on Vacant or Redeveloping Lots. This section promotes tree conservation by establishing minimum tree density requirements, expressed as tree units per 40,000 square feet, or for larger lots percentage of canopy cover, for applicable project proposals and tree conservation permit approvals per PTMC 19.06.100, and for certain tree removal activities that may be exempt from PTMC 19.06.060 through 19.06.070 of Article II but still require compliance with minimum tree conservation standards. It is intended that the tree density requirements will be met primarily through the conservation of existing trees. However, in order to provide for continued flexibility in the design of new development, in those situations where a developments design would preclude the retention of the required number of trees, the use of replacement or supplemental tree planting is authorized. The minimum tree density for each land use designation is specified in Table 19.06.120(D)(1). 

B. Sites with Insufficient Tree Cover. It is recognized that some sites may not contain a sufficient number of existing trees to meet the tree density standards set forth in Table 19.06.120(D)(1). In those situations, additional trees shall be planted as necessary to achieve the minimum tree density requirements of this chapter unless an alternative tree retention plan is approved, per subsection C of this section.

C. Alternative Tree Conservation Plans.

1. Some lots, sites or land uses provide valuable open space functions, including but not limited to maintaining view corridors, that may conflict with the planting dense stands of trees. Examples include portions of town that historically have had few trees, such as Happy Valley; or, some land uses, such as crop or tree farming or gardening, small animal husbandry, recreational play fields, etc., which are dependent upon open space and solar access. Alternative tree conservation or planting plans that do not meet the strict requirements of the tables of this section may be proposed in such circumstances. 

2. Alternative tree conservation plans may be approved by the DSD director upon a showing to his/her satisfaction that:

a. Due to the physical characteristics of the site, or those of contiguous properties, and/or due to the design goals of a particular development (including but not limited to preserving solar access or maintaining the character of open grassland areas), strict adherence to the tree conservation standards set forth in subsections A, B, D through G of this section would be inappropriate or unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this title or would be unreasonably burdensome upon the applicant; and

b. The alternative plan is consistent with the purposes of this chapter expressed in PTMC 19.06.010; and

c. Alternative plans must provide environmental, recreational, agricultural, and/or aesthetic benefits that are equal or greater to the tree retention standards contained in the tables in this section.

3. Off-Site Mitigation and Fees Paid in Lieu. Where an applicant cannot provide sufficient on-site benefits to approve an alternative tree conservation plan, off-site mitigation or payment into the city’s urban forestry account may be approved by the DSD director. Where off-site mitigation is used, the remaining balance of trees must be planted at an off-site location approved by the DSD director. Where the site is city-owned property, the public works department must also approve the tree planting. Acceptable off-site locations, in order of priority, are as follows: 

a. Publicly owned land in the city of Port Townsend including but not limited to: environmentally sensitive areas, regional stormwater facilities, or wildlife corridors. Similar lands owned by nonprofit entities which are reserved in open space also qualify; 

b. Publicly owned parks or recreational facilities within the city of Port Townsend; 

c. Public school sites within the city of Port Townsend;

d. Other mitigation or restoration sites managed by other public entities or private conservation groups; 

e. Other sites proposed by the applicant, when it is documented that higher priority sites are not available or viable. 

D. Tree Density Requirements. All regulated activity shall ensure that the following tree densities shall be achieved and maintained during and after development:

Table 19.06.120(D)(1) 

Minimum Tree Density Requirements for Vacant or Redeveloping Lots 

	Zoning District	Required Tree Unit Density

	R-I, R-II, P/OS(B)	40 tree units/40,000 square feet

	R-III, R-IV, C-I/MU, C-II/MU	30 tree units/40,000 square feet

	C-I, C-II, C-II(H), P-I, M-C	20 tree units/40,000 square feet

	C-III, M-II(A), M-II(B), M-I, M-III, P/OS	N/A

2. Calculation of the Total Tree Units Required. The total number of tree units required to be provided by a regulated project or tree conservation permit approval listed in PTMC 19.06.100 shall be calculated by multiplying gross site area, minus any public or private street rights-of-way, by the required tree density (in tree units per 40,000 square feet) set forth in Table 19.06.120(D)(1). The result of the calculation will be the total number of tree units required for the project approval.

a. The tree unit calculation shall include retained or newly planted trees within the site as well as newly planted street trees located in contiguous public rights-of-way or alleys. 

3. Tree Unit Credits. The number of tree unit credits given for retaining existing trees or the planting of new trees varies in order to encourage the retention of large existing trees and the planting of replacement trees that provide greater canopy areas at maturity. Tree unit credits for the retention of existing trees and the planting of new trees shall be awarded as follows:

Table 19.06.120(D)(3) 

Tree Unit Credits  

	Tree Category	Tree Unit Credit

	Existing Tree 1'' to 6'' d.b.h.	1 tree unit per tree retained

	Existing Tree 7'' to 19'' d.b.h.	2 tree units per tree retained

	Existing Tree > 20'' d.b.h.	3 tree units per tree retained

	New or Replacement Tree, Small to Medium Species (At maturity less than 40 feet tall)	0.50 tree unit per tree planted

	New or Replacement Tree, Large Species (At maturity more than 40 feet tall)	1 tree unit per tree planted

E. Expansions of Existing Commercial, Mixed Use, and Public Buildings that are Nonconforming Regarding Minimum Tree Density. Expansions to existing commercial, mixed use, multifamily, or public buildings located in the C-I/MU, C-II/MU C-I, C-II, C-II(H), R-III, R-IV, P/OS(B), P-I, M-C zoning districts where the sites do not conform to the tree density requirements of PTMC 19.06.120(D) or (G) shall be subject to the following tree conservation standards:

1. A minimum of one tree unit shall be provided for each 500 square feet of building expansion or new construction up to the maximum of the tree units specified for the applicable zoning district in Table 19.06.120(D)(3); and

2. In addition to the requirements of subsection (E)(1) of this section, where existing trees will be removed to allow the new addition, a minimum of three tree units shall be provided for each tree unit removed, up to the minimum tree units specified for the applicable zoning district by Table 19.06.120(D)(3).

F. Non-Single-Family Residential Developed Lots – Removal and Replacement of More than 20 Percent of Trees – Landscaping Activities. On developed non-single-family residential lots where removal of healthy trees is proposed as part of landscape maintenance, no more than six trees or 20 percent of the healthy trees on the property, whichever is greater, shall be removed within a calendar year. Where replacement of healthy trees is desired, replacement shall occur in a phased manner over time to reduce aesthetic impacts. 

G. Large Lot Calculation Procedure. Project sites that are large, such as over 40,000 square feet in size, may use the following alternative canopy cover calculation to determine minimum tree density requirements:

Table 19.06.120(G) 

Alternative Canopy Cover Calculation for Large Sites 

	Zoning District	Required Tree Unit Density/Canopy Cover1

	R-I, R-II, P/OS(B)	 25% canopy cover

	R-III, R-IV, C-I/MU, C-II/MU	 15% canopy cover

	C-I, C-II, C-II(H), P-I, M-C	10% canopy cover

	C-III, M-II(A), M-II(B), M-I, M-III, P/OS	N/A

1 “Canopy cover” means the percentage of lot area covered by the crowns of the trees to be retained on the site post development as delineated by the vertical projection of its outermost perimeter of the tree branches. Small openings in the crown are included. Public streets and other dedicated public rights-of-way shall not be included in lot area.

(Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.130 Standards for trees to be retained or planted.

A. Health and Quality of Trees Proposed for Retention. Trees proposed for retention must meet the following minimum standards in order to be credited towards satisfying the tree density requirements of this chapter:

1. Healthy trees over 24 inches in diameter at d.b.h. or that are over 100 years of age shall be priority trees for preservation. Priority trees should only be removed if their retention is not feasible (e.g., within footprint of likely future building area and not reasonable to modify building size or footprint);

2. The retained trees shall be equivalent to the average size, species, and age of the trees existing on the site prior to development or tree removal;

3. Retained trees shall be predominantly dominant or codominant trees (meaning fully branched and generally proportional in height and breadth for the tree age); 

4. Retained trees must be healthy and have no substantial evidence of disease (unless identified as a habitat tree per subsection (A)(9) of this section), meaning that retained trees shall have a relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay or hollow and no significant trunk damage, and should have no significant crown damage;

5. Trees should be selected for retention based upon a consideration of windthrow potential, wildlife value, aesthetics, and compatibility with future development;

6. Retained trees should be clustered wherever possible to maximize habitat value and to minimize windthrow. Strips of trees along a site’s perimeter boundaries should be carefully evaluated for windthrow potential;

7. Trees being retained in environmentally sensitive areas and associated buffers may be applied towards tree canopy retention or tree unit credit requirements;

8. Trees must be windfirm in upon completion of development activities (no significant root damage); and

9. Trees identified as having significant habitat value shall be priority trees for preservation regardless of the health or state of the tree (such as trees with broken crowns ideal for eagle perching or snags, especially along shoreline bluffs), so long as such trees are not a danger to nearby buildings.

B. Health and Quality of Trees Proposed for Planting. Trees proposed for planting must meet the following minimum standards in order to be credited towards satisfying the tree density requirements of this chapter:

1. Each tree shall be healthy stock and carefully planted in an appropriately sized planting area.

2. Each required deciduous tree shall have a minimum of three-quarter-inch caliper within six inches of ground at time of planting.

3. Each required evergreen tree shall have a minimum height of three feet at time of planting.

4. Trees planted shall include a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees. At a minimum 25 percent of the trees planted shall be coniferous. 

5. To avoid potentially unhealthy monocultures, the total number of any individual species of replacement tree planted shall not exceed 15 percent of the same species or 25 percent of the same genus of the total number of all replacement trees planted.

a. For example, red maple (Acer rubrum) and silver maple (Acer saccharinum) are two different species, but they are the same genus, Acer (maples). Many pests would not distinguish between a red maple or a silver maple, but those that feed on maples probably will not attack oaks or firs.

6. Where possible, required trees should predominantly be selected from the native tree species. DSD will maintain a list of native tree species. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.140 Residential development tree location requirements. 

A. Tree Locations Outside Residential Lots. Proposed residential subdivisions, short plats, planned developments, condominium projects, and cottage housing developments shall locate a minimum of 25 percent of the required trees within areas of land separate from residential lots. Such areas include, but are not limited to, open space areas, tree buffers, environmentally sensitive areas, stormwater tracts, and street or alley rights-of-way.

B. Tree Locations Within Residential Lots. Other trees proposed for residential developments subject to this chapter shall be located within the required side, rear, or front yard areas in order to minimize development related conflicts, unless otherwise approved by the development services department. When these lots or building sites are located to protective tracts (such as park, stormwater, or environmentally sensitive areas), the preferred location of the trees is adjacent to these areas.

C. Supplemental Trees Required for Residential Development. Where proposed residential subdivisions, short plats, planned developments, condominium projects, or cottage housing developments require new tree plantings (cannot meet minimum tree density through tree retention alone); new tree plantings may occur after final plat approval, but shall occur in compliance with the tree conservation plan prior to issuance of the final building permit for each lot or condominium unit as it is developed. In such cases the face of the final plat or condominium site plan shall indicate that lot or condominium owners will be responsible for tree plantings prior to final occupancy permits being issued for each home or condo. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.150 Protection of trees before and during development.

All trees and tree stands proposed for retention and supplemental tree plantings shall be protected before and during site development and construction through adherence to the following requirements:

A. A tree protection area shall be designed to protect each tree or tree stand during site development and construction. The tree protection areas shall conform to the approved tree conservation plan. 

B. Ideally, tree protection areas should extend to the drip line of the tree plus three feet. However, in many instances this will not be possible due to site constraints. Tree protection areas shall be as large as feasible given site constraints and the nature of the project. 

C. Tree protection areas shall be clearly shown on all applicable site development, preliminary plats, and construction drawings. 

D. Tree protection areas shall be designated through the following minimum standards:

1. Chain link or other type of sturdy construction fencing attached to posts set in the ground a minimum of 12 inches and spaced no more than 10 feet apart; and

2. Colored tape, ribbon, or other identification tags attached to protected trees. 

E. Optional methods to provide additional protection for tree roots include:

1. Placing layers of protective mulch, six inches to two feet deep, over tree roots to help avoid soil compaction over roots that may be subject to nearby equipment use. Once construction is complete, excess mulch shall be removed leaving a maximum of two-inch mulch cover over pre-existing grade.

F. Approved tree protection areas shall be designated in the field prior to the initiation of any clearing or grading. Tree protection areas shall remain in place through site development until project completion, or earlier with prior authorization by the DSD director.

G. No clearing, grading, filling, operating of heavy equipment, trenching, or other development activities shall occur within tree protection areas. Tree protection areas may only be modified or temporarily relocated with the prior written approval of the DSD director.

H. DSD may approve the use of alternate tree protection techniques if the above standards would create an undue hardship upon the applicant (such as designating buffer boundaries for large sites over an acre) and if the trees will be protected to an equal or greater degree than provided by this chapter. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.160 Tree conservation affidavits – Development on sites with prior approved tree conservation plans. 

A. Tree Conservation Affidavits for Sites with Previously Approved Tree Conservation Plans. Site development and or other activities involving tree removal proposed on property which is subject to a previously approved tree conservation plan shall be required to complete only a tree conservation affidavit. Tree conservation affidavits verify that tree retention areas will be marked, protected and located during subsequent development activities. They are also used to ensure the installation of any trees on a lot required by a prior approved tree conservation plan. 

1. For example, a preliminary plat approval may require street trees to be installed prior to final plat approval but may defer individual tree plantings on individual residential lots each lot is developed with an individual home. In such a case the trees would be planted consistent with the tree conservation plan for the plat but installed prior to final occupancy of the home. Once the home is constructed, all trees planted per the tree conservation plan, future landscape maintenance activities are subject to the provisions of Article II, including the exemptions for single-family residentially developed lots. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.170 Review of tree conservation plans and affidavits. 

A. DSD shall review all tree conservation plans and affidavits to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter prior to the approval of any associated development permit or application. 

B. Tree Conservation Affidavits. 

1. Applicants that are required to complete a tree conservation affidavit as a condition of development approval shall be provided the necessary forms prior to approval of the building or other project permit. The tree conservation affidavit shall include any conditions regarding tree protection and/or planting that apply to the particular property being developed.

2. The city of Port Townsend shall not issue building, site development, or other permits for development until such time as the tree conservation affidavit has been completed.

C. Tree Conservation Plans. 

1. Tree conservation plans shall be reviewed by the department within the time limitations specified in Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development and Administration Procedures. Upon completion of its review, the department shall take one of the following actions:

a. Approve the tree conservation plan, with or without conditions; or

b. Disapprove the tree conservation plan, indicating deficiencies to the applicant. If the tree conservation plan is determined to be deficient, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the deficiency and shall be provided the opportunity to modify the plan as necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

2. Tree conservation plans shall be reviewed by the department prior to the approval of the associated underlying permit or application. The underlying permit may not be approved until such time as the department has approved the tree conservation plan.

3. The tree conservation plan shall be incorporated by reference in any approval issued for the underlying permit or application. Compliance with the tree conservation plan shall be a condition of such approval.

D. The property owner shall be required to file a notice with the Jefferson County auditor. The notice shall provide a public record of any approved tree conservation plan and tree conservation areas; the application of this title to the property; and that limitations on actions in or affecting the property may exist.

E. With the exception of minor vegetation disturbance to allow surveying and necessary technical studies, tree removal activities pursuant to the tree conservation plan shall not begin until the concurrent project permit application or the tree conservation permit has been approved. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.180 Maintenance requirements.

A. Commercial, mixed use, public, and multifamily projects subject to tree conservation plans shall are subject to the following ongoing maintenance standards for retained or newly planted trees:

1. All retained trees shall be continually maintained in a healthy growing condition by the property owner, or where appropriate, the homeowner’s or condominium association. 

2. Dead or dying trees shall be replaced within 180 days of removal with a healthy tree meeting the requirements of PTMC 19.06.130. The tree density units provided by the replacement trees shall be equivalent to that provided by the trees being replaced. The preferred planting time for replacement trees is October 1st through March 1st. Tree replacement during the summer months (June 15th through August 31st) should be avoided unless supplemental irrigation is available.

3. Pruning of trees shall be limited to limbing and crown thinning. Topping shall be treated the same as removal of the tree.

B. Single-Family Residential Development. Once the home is constructed and all trees planted per the tree conservation plan, future landscape maintenance activities are subject to the provisions of Article II, including the exemptions for single-family residentially developed lots.

C. Three-Year Maintenance Agreement. As a condition of final approval, the following project permit approvals shall demonstrate that a minimum three-year maintenance agreement exists with a commercial landscape care company, or other entity approved by the DSD director, addressing the following:

1. For short plats, subdivisions, planned unit developments, and cottage housing developments that are subject to tree conservation plans per this chapter, newly planted trees in street rights-of-way (street trees), common areas, stormwater ponds, and tree buffers (excluding trees on private single-family residential lots which are the homeowners’ responsibility);

2. For multifamily, commercial, or industrial developments that are subject to tree conservation plans per this chapter, all trees and plants identified in the applicable tree conservation and landscaping plans. (Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.190  Time limitations.

A. A tree conservation permit approval shall be valid for two consecutive years following the date of issuance unless a longer time period has been established through an associated project approval (e.g., preliminary plat approval, conditional use permit, etc.) in which case the time limits applicable to the associated approval shall apply.

B. Tree conservation plans associated with a project permit approval shall be subject to the same time limitations, if any, on the underlying project permit approval. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).

Article IV. Administration, Appeals, and Enforcement


19.06.200 Permit procedures and appeals.

A. Permit Procedures. Permit applications specified by this chapter shall be processed pursuant to Chapter 20.01 PTMC, Land Development Administrative Procedures. The following permit activities defined by this chapter shall be classified as follows by the procedures of Chapter 20.01 PTMC: 

1. Exemptions requiring a written approval shall be processed as Type I-A permit applications;

2. Tree conservation permit approvals shall be processed as Type II permit applications.

B. Administrative Appeals. Appeals of any administrative decision and procedures for reconsideration or appeal of a hearing examiner decision issued pursuant to this chapter are also set forth in Chapter 20.01 PTMC. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.210 Minor modifications to approved tree conservation permit approvals or tree conservation plans. 

Minor modifications to an approved tree conservation permit approval or tree conservation plan may be approved administratively pursuant to the procedures for a Type I-A project permit (Chapter 20.01 PTMC) provided the proposed modification is minor in nature, does not increase the overall area of tree removal, does not change the overall number of trees removed, or result in tree removal activities occurring within an environmental sensitive area, ESA buffer, or tree retention area. The submittal of an amended tree conservation plan meeting the requirements of this chapter may be required. Any modification exceeding these thresholds shall require a new application and associated fees. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).


19.06.220 Variances.

A. Process. Variances to the requirements of this chapter may be considered pursuant to the criteria set forth in Chapter 17.86 PTMC, Variances. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2003).

Article I. Types of Project Permit Applications


20.01.010 Purpose and definitions.

A. Purpose. In enacting this chapter, the city council intends to establish a mechanism for implementing the provisions of Chapter 36.70B RCW (the Regulatory Reform Act) regarding compliance, conformity, and consistency of proposed projects with the city’s adopted comprehensive plan and development regulations. In order to achieve this purpose, the city council finds that:

1. Given the extensive investment that public agencies and a broad spectrum of the public are making and will continue to make in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan and development regulations, it is essential that project review start from the fundamental land use planning choices made in the comprehensive plan and regulations. If the applicable regulations or plan identify the type of land use, specify residential density, and identify and provide for funding of public facilities needed to serve the proposed development and site, these decisions at minimum provide the foundation for further project review unless there is a question of code interpretation. The project review process, including the environmental review process under Chapter 43.21C RCW and the consideration of consistency, should start from this point and should not reanalyze these land use planning decisions in making a permit decision, unless the city finds that the plan and development regulations do not fully foresee site-specific issues and impacts identified through land use project application review.

2. Comprehensive plans and development regulations adopted by the city under Chapter 36.70A RCW (the Growth Management Act), subarea plans, and environmental policies, laws and rules adopted by the city, the state, and the federal government address a wide range of environmental subjects and impacts. These provisions typically require environmental studies and contain specific standards to address various impacts associated with a proposed development, such as building size and location, drainage, transportation requirements, and protection of environmentally sensitive areas. When the city applies these existing requirements to a proposed project, some or all of a project’s potential environmental impacts may be avoided or otherwise mitigated. Through the integrated project review process described in this chapter, the director of the development services department (DSD) will determine whether existing requirements, including the applicable regulations or plans, adequately analyze and address a project’s environmental impacts. Project review generally should not require additional studies and mitigation under Chapter 43.21C RCW where existing regulations adequately address a proposed project’s probable significant adverse environmental impacts. Development regulations generally enable project review through the application of established scientific standards, required studies and standard mitigation measures.

B. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply throughout this chapter:

C. Decisionmaker(s). Applications processed in accordance with subsection B of this section which have the same highest numbered procedure but are assigned different hearing bodies shall be heard collectively by the highest decisionmaker(s). The city council is the highest, followed by the hearing examiner, and then the director. Joint public hearings with other agencies shall be processed according to PTMC 20.01.050.

D. Administrator. Upon issuance of a determination of completeness described in PTMC 20.01.110, the director shall assign an administrator to the project who will coordinate and be responsible for all phases of development application administration. At any stage during project review the director may assign a different project administrator.

B. Identification of Other Agencies with Jurisdiction. To the extent known by the city, other agencies with jurisdiction over the project permit application shall be identified in the city’s determination required by subsection A of this section.

C. Incomplete Application Procedure.

1. If the applicant receives a determination from the city that an application is not complete or that additional information is required, the applicant shall have 120 calendar days to submit the necessary information to the city. Within 14 calendar days after an applicant has submitted the requested additional information, the city shall make the determination as described in subsection A of this section and notify the applicant in the same manner.

2. If the applicant either refuses in writing to submit additional information or does not submit the required information within the 120-day period, the director shall make a determination that the application has been abandoned and is therefore withdrawn, according to the Type I procedure in PTMC 20.01.040.

F. Additional Information. A project permit application is complete for purposes of this section when it meets the submission requirements in PTMC 20.01.100, as well as the submission requirements contained in the applicable development regulations. This determination of completeness shall be made when the application is sufficient for continued processing even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be undertaken after submittal. The city’s determination of completeness shall not preclude the city from requiring additional information, that the applicant correct plans or perform studies at any time if new information is required for project review, or if there are substantial changes in the proposed action.

1. Pursuant to RCW 36.70B.090(1) (a)(i), any period during which the city has requested the applicant to correct plans, perform required studies, or provide additional information shall be excluded from the time period provided in this chapter.

2. The time period for requiring additional information shall be calculated from the date the city notifies the applicant of the need for additional information until the earlier of: (a) the date the city determines whether the information satisfies the request for information; or (b) 14 calendar days after the date the information has been provided to the city.

G. Effect of Project Permit Application Revisions – Substantial Revisions. If, in the judgment of the director, the content of an application is so substantially revised by an applicant, either voluntarily or to conform with applicable standards and requirements, that such revised proposal constitutes a substantially different proposal than that originally submitted, the director shall deem the revised proposal to be a new application.

1. In reaching a decision whether a revision is substantial, the director shall consider the relative and absolute magnitude of the revision, the environmental sensitivity of the site, any changes in location of significant elements of the project and their relation to public facilities, surrounding lands and land uses and the stage of review of the proposal.

2. Lesser revisions that would not constitute substantial revisions during early stages of review may be substantial during later stages due to the reduced time and opportunity remaining for interested parties to review and comment upon such changes.

3. Written notice of such determination of substantial revision shall be provided to the applicant and all parties of record, including the reasons for the director’s decision.

4. A determination that any revision is substantial shall result in the time periods mandated by the Regulatory Reform Act, Chapter 36.70B RCW, set forth in this chapter starting from the date at which the revised project application is determined to be complete. The revised project application shall be subject to all laws, regulations, and standards in effect on the date of the determination of completeness of the substantial revision.

5. If the revision has a bearing upon or affects HPC review, the director shall refer the application to HPC for additional mandatory public meeting(s) as necessary. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-4), 2010; Ord. 2762 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2521 § 1, 1996).


20.01.120 Referral and review of development permit applications.

Upon acceptance of a complete application, the director shall do the following:

A. Transmit a copy of the application, or appropriate parts of the application, to each affected agency and city department for review and comment, including those agencies responsible for determining compliance with state and federal requirements. The affected agencies and city departments shall have 10 calendar days to comment. The director may grant an extension of time if needed.

B. Environmental Review. Developments and planned actions subject to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), Chapter 43.21C RCW, shall be reviewed in accordance with the policies and procedures contained in Chapter 19.04 PTMC. SEPA review shall be conducted concurrently with development project review. The following are exempt from concurrent review:

1. Projects categorically exempt from SEPA; and

2. Components of planned actions previously reviewed and approved in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan or amendments thereto to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the SEPA environmental determination for the planned action.

C. Historic Preservation Committee (HPC) Review. For those actions subject to design review pursuant to Chapter 17.30 PTMC, the director shall refer the application to HPC. Pursuant to Chapter 17.30 PTMC, HPC shall hold one or more public meeting(s) as necessary to consider the application. HPC review shall be completed within 45 calendar days after the issuance of the determination of completeness. HPC recommendations shall be based upon design guidelines formally adopted by the city council and shall be included in the staff report and recommendation transmitted to the director. For Type I administrative permits, DSD shall review HPC recommendations and shall incorporate those recommendations as permit conditions and requirements, so long as the recommendations are based upon formally adopted design guidelines or are based upon a voluntary agreement of the applicant.

D. If a Type III procedure is required, DSD shall provide for notice and hearing as set forth in PTMC 20.01.150 through 20.01.190. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-4), 2010; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2762 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2592 § 5, 1997; Ord. 2521 § 1, 1996).


20.01.130 Scope of project review.

A. Fundamental land use planning choices made in adopted comprehensive and subarea plans and development regulations shall serve as the foundation for project review. The review of a proposed project’s consistency with applicable development regulations, or in the absence of applicable regulations the adopted Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan or subarea plan(s), under PTMC 20.01.140 shall incorporate the determinations under this section.

B. During project review, the director (and, as applicable, the hearing examiner) shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project or, in the absence of applicable regulations, the adopted Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan or subarea plan(s). At a minimum, such applicable regulations or plans shall be determinative of the:

1. Type of land use permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances, such as planned unit developments and conditional and special uses, if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied;

2. Density of residential development in urban growth areas; and

3. Availability and adequacy of public facilities identified in the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan, if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities.

C. During project review, the director shall not re-examine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in subsection B of this section.

D. The director may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis and mitigation measures in development regulations and other applicable laws provide adequate mitigation for some or all of the project’s specific probable significant adverse environmental impacts to which the requirements apply. In making this determination, the director shall:

1. Determine if the applicable regulations require measures that are sufficient to adequately address site-specific, probable significant adverse environmental impacts identified through project application review; and

2. Determine whether additional studies are required and/or whether the project permit application should be conditioned with additional mitigation measures.

E. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city to approve, condition, or deny a project as provided in its development regulations adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW and in its policies and criteria adopted under RCW 43.21C.060, including project review under Chapters 19.04 (SEPA) and 19.05 (Critical Areas) PTMC. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-4), 2010; Ord. 2762 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2521 § 1, 1996).


20.01.140 Project consistency.

A. A proposed project’s consistency with development regulations adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW (the GMA) or, in the absence of applicable development regulations, the appropriate elements of the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW shall be determined by consideration of:

1. The type of land use;

2. The level of development, such as units per acre or other measures of density;

3. Infrastructure, including public facilities and services needed to serve the development; and

4. The character of the development, such as development standards.

B. In determining consistency, the determinations made pursuant to PTMC 20.01.130 shall be controlling.

C. For purposes of this section, the term “consistency” shall include all terms used in this chapter and Chapter 36.70A RCW to refer to performance in accordance with this chapter and Chapter 36.70A RCW, including but not limited to compliance, conformity, and consistency.

D. Nothing in this section requires documentation, dictates procedures for considering consistency, or limits the director from asking more specific or related questions with respect to any of the four main categories listed in subsections (A)(1) through (4) of this section. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-4), 2010; Ord. 2762 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2521 § 1, 1996).

3. Consistency with Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan and other relevant codes and policies.

D. Conflicts with Other Regulations. Where conflicts occur between the provisions of a development code and the building and fire codes or other regulations of the city, the more restrictive shall apply.

The DSD director shall mail a written response to any person filing a written request to interpret the provisions of the development code within 28 days of having received that request; provided, however, that when a request is made while a project is pending and after a determination of completeness has been issued, the permit applicant must agree to waive the time frame required under Chapter 20.01 PTMC to allow for preparation of the interpretation, and any changes to the project that the interpretation might require. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-5), 2010; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2531 § 1, 1996).

B. Enforcement. An interpretation of the code issued in accordance with these provisions may be enforced in the same manner that any provision of the development code is enforced. All written interpretations of the code with a current index of such interpretations shall be maintained by the DSD and made available for public inspection. (Ord. 3026 § 1 (Exh. A-5), 2010; Ord. 2892 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2531 § 1, 1996).


20.02.050 Appeal of interpretation by DSD director.

When an interpretation is made in response to a written request pursuant to these provisions, the person filing the written request may appeal the decision of the DSD director to the hearing examiner within 14 calendar days of the decision, using the process for appeals of Type II permit decisions as set forth in PTMC 20.01.295.

20.04.010 Amendments – Definitions, purpose and introduction.

A. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply throughout this chapter:

1. “Department” shall mean the development services department.

2. “Director” shall mean the DSD director or his/her designee.

B. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process by which the city reviews and amends the Comprehensive Plan or land use map in accordance with the provisions of the Growth Management Act (GMA) in order to respond to changing circumstances or needs of the city. This chapter also establishes the city’s public participation program as required by RCW 36.70A.140.

Pursuant to the GMA, the city must periodically review and, if needed, revise its Comprehensive Plan and development regulations to ensure that they comply with the GMA, as per the schedule provided in RCW 36.70A.130. The city may consider proposed amendments no more frequently than once every year with limited exceptions (see PTMC 20.04.030).

This chapter is intended to provide a process based upon the GMA periodic update cycle that includes: (1) an annual process with timelines and procedures whereby property owners, their agents or project proponents may submit applications for formal, site-specific amendments to the Comprehensive Plan; (2) a process whereby the city will compile and maintain a preliminary docket of proposed suggested amendments to be processed during the GMA periodic update or more frequently as may be directed by council and then select which proposed suggested amendments will be placed on the final docket for review; and (3) criteria for review of the final docket by the planning commission and city council. This chapter also provides a process for the planning commission to periodically monitor and assess the Comprehensive Plan, and based on this review to recommend amendments (if any) to the Plan.

C. Public Participation. The public participation process set forth in this chapter is intended to solicit from the public suggested amendments to the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan for future consideration, and to provide an opportunity for public comment on any proposed amendments. This is achieved by early and continuous public involvement with broad dissemination of proposals and alternatives, opportunity for written comments, public meetings after effective notice, provisions for open discussion, information services, and consideration and response to public comments.

D. Planning Commission Role. The planning commission shall make recommendations to the city council on all Comprehensive Plan matters, including amendments to the plan text and land use map, development regulations and subarea plans. To this end, the planning commission shall conduct such assessments and hearings as are required by this chapter and shall make findings and conclusions therefrom which shall be transmitted to the director which shall transmit the same on to city council with such comments and recommendations deemed necessary.

E. Applicability of Chapter 20.01 PTMC. Updates, amendments or revisions to the Comprehensive Plan text, the land use map, and the development regulations are legislative, Type V decisions under Chapter 20.01 PTMC, and particularly PTMC 20.01.060 and 20.01.070. Accordingly, all applicable provisions of that chapter apply to the decision-making process adopted in this chapter, regardless of whether they are specifically referred to herein. (Ord. 3193 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3104 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2824 § 2, 2002; Ord. 2559 § 1, 1996).


20.04.020 Amendment cycles – Cumulative effects must be considered. 

A. GMA Periodic Update. Pursuant to the GMA, the city must periodically review and, if needed, revise its Comprehensive Plan and development regulations to ensure that they comply with the GMA, as per the schedule provided in RCW 36.70A.130. Often, this is a multi-year/multi-phase effort which begins with analytical work and scoping and culminates in public hearings to review draft documents.

B. Annual Amendment Docket. In addition to the GMA periodic update, the city must consider certain types of amendments on an annual basis. The following types of amendments shall be docketed and considered on an annual basis:

1. Site-specific “formal” applications, timely filed and accompanied by a filing fee;

2. Time sensitive mandated amendments as determined by the director of development services; and

3. Amendments necessary to address a deficiency in the Comprehensive Plan or development regulations identified during project review (pursuant to RCW 36.70A.470(3)), provided, if resources are unavailable, the amendment could be carried over.

C. Suggested Amendment Cycle. In recognition of limited resources and consistent with WAC 365-196-640(6), suggested amendments shall be compiled by the director and forwarded to the planning commission for consideration on the final docket per the procedure set forth in PTMC 20.04.060. This review shall take place during the GMA periodic update or as may be directed by council pursuant to PTMC 20.04.035(B).

D. Update Processes Shall Not Overlap. Pursuant to WAC 365-196-610(3), the GMA periodic review and annual amendment docket may not overlap. Given that the GMA periodic update is a multi-year/multi-phase process, it may interrupt the annual amendment cycle. During the first phase (Phase I) of a GMA update, where the focus is primarily data analysis, an annual amendment process may be processed on a parallel track. However, during Phase II of a GMA update where the focus is primarily policy development, the annual docket must be combined with the broader GMA docket or postponed until the year following the update.

E. Except as provided in PTMC 20.04.030, Comprehensive Plan amendments shall not be considered by the city council more frequently than once every year.

F. Cumulative Effects. Proposals for plan amendment shall be considered concurrently so that the cumulative effect of all items on the final docket will be ascertained. Proposals may be considered at separate meetings or hearings, so long as the final action taken considers the cumulative effect of all the proposed amendments to the Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 3193 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3104 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2824 § 2, 2002; Ord. 2559 § 1, 1996).


20.04.030 Exceptions to the annual amendment process.

A. Exceptions. In addition to the annual amendment process specified in PTMC 20.04.020, the city council may amend the Port Townsend Comprehensive Plan in any of the following circumstances:

1. The city council may initiate amendments to the Comprehensive Plan during each annual amendment. An affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the total members of the council is required to initiate consideration of such an amendment. During formal amendment cycles, the council shall enter a finding that to wait until the next suggested amendment cycle would be detrimental to the public’s interests. Council-initiated amendments shall be automatically placed on the docket and shall be considered in the next scheduled annual amendment process. The director and the planning commission may request the city council initiate a particular amendment during the next annual amendment process;

2. Resolution of an emergency condition or situation that involves public health, safety or welfare and when adherence to the annual amendment process would be detrimental to public health, safety or welfare;

3. Initial adoption or amendment to an identified subarea plan or functional plan that clarifies, supplements, or implements jurisdiction-wide Comprehensive Plan policies; the subarea plan or functional plan may only be adopted if the cumulative impacts of the proposed plan are addressed by appropriate environmental review;

4. Resolution of a decision by an administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction. Situations involving official legal or administrative action (such as decisions by the Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board, or the state or federal courts, actions of a state agency or office, or the State Legislature) affecting Port Townsend will be reviewed by the planning commission with advice from the city attorney’s office to determine if an appropriate “emergency” exists, necessitating an emergency Comprehensive Plan amendment;

5. The correction of unintentional mapping “errors” on the city’s official zoning, shoreline, nonmotorized, critical areas, or other regulatory or planning maps;

6. The adoption or amendment of the city’s shoreline master program under the procedures set forth in Chapter 90.58 RCW; and

7. The amendment of the capital facilities element of the Comprehensive Plan that occurs concurrently with the adoption or amendment of the city’s budget. (Ord. 3193 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3104 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2892 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2824 § 2, 2002; Ord. 2559 § 1, 1996).


20.04.035 Schedule for GMA periodic updates, annual, and suggested amendments.

A. Responsibility. The director shall have the responsibility to manage the preliminary docket as set forth in this section and assure that the process and schedule set forth herein are followed.

B. On or before December 15th of each year, council may elect to open the next annual amendment process to suggested amendments. This decision shall be made by resolution no later than December 15th of the preceding year to ensure notice required in subsection C of this section includes call for suggested amendments. Council action should be based upon consideration of available resources to review amendments and implement the Comprehensive Plan.

C. The public shall be made aware of the deadline to submit proposed amendments to the Comprehensive Plan by means of two publications in the local newspaper of general circulation in the city, with the first notice published at least 30 days prior to the deadline.

D. GMA Periodic Updates. The city shall take action to review and, if needed, revise the Comprehensive Plan and development regulations in accordance with the schedule adopted in RCW 36.70A.130(5)(b) and the procedures contained in this chapter. The scope of work for each GMA periodic update may vary depending upon applicable state mandates and local needs.

E. Site-specific amendments/amendments necessary to correct a deficiency identified during project review may be proposed annually consistent with the processes and requirements of PTMC 20.04.040 for “formal” applications.

F. Suggested Amendments. Suggested amendments shall only be considered for docketing during Phase I of the GMA periodic update unless otherwise directed by council pursuant to subsection B of this section. The limitation on suggested amendments is intended to allow for increased implementation of the Comprehensive Plan and consideration of suggested amendments in a more concerted fashion with broader public participation.

G. Planning Commission Assessment. Conducted pursuant to PTMC 20.04.050(A) during Phase I of each GMA periodic update and in interim years as may be directed by council. Intended to periodically assess changes in the community and whether amendments to the Comprehensive Plan are warranted. (Ord. 3193 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 3104 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2824 § 3, 2002). 


20.04.040 Applications for Comprehensive Plan amendment – Formal and suggested amendments.

A. Who May Propose an Amendment – Application – Fee.

1. Formal Applications. Any interested person, defined as proponents of land development projects and/or property owner(s) or their authorized representative(s), may file a formal application for an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan; provided, that the proposed amendment relates to a site-specific proposal. Any such application must be accompanied by the applicable filing fee. Examples include application to amend the land use and zoning maps (i.e., rezone); application to correct a deficiency identified during project review.

2. Suggested Amendments. Anyone may suggest an amendment, which shall be added to the “list of proposed amendments” to be maintained by the director and placed on the preliminary docket for planning commission’s consideration during Phase I of a GMA update cycle or as may be directed by council pursuant to PTMC 20.04.035(B). In general, suggested amendments should be limited to proposals that broadly apply to the goals, policies and implementing strategies of the Comprehensive Plan, rather than amendments designed to address site-specific issues of limited applicability. Whether such amendments are placed on the final docket shall be governed by the process outlined in PTMC 20.04.060. No fee shall be required for such proposals.

B. Amendment Deadline/Form. All suggested or formal amendments must be submitted to the department by February 1st of the current year in order to be considered during that year’s amendment process, except that city-sponsored amendments to the capital facilities and utilities element of the Comprehensive Plan may be accepted later than other proposed amendments because of their relationship to the city’s annual budget process; provided, however, that suggested amendments will be compiled by the director and forwarded for review only during Phase I of a GMA update cycle or as may be directed by council pursuant to PTMC 20.04.035(B). All proposed amendments shall be submitted on department forms and include the following information, as determined by the department, to be necessary to evaluate the particular proposal:

1. Name and address of applicant;

2. A description of proposed plan amendment. Site-specific amendments shall provide adequate information to show that development consistent with the proposed density and uses is or can be served by existing or proposed infrastructure.

20.04.050 Planning commission assessment – Compilation of preliminary docket.

A. Planning Commission Assessment of Comprehensive Plan.

1. Criteria for Assessment.

20.04.060 Process for selection of amendments to be considered during suggested amendment cycles – Setting the docket – Public notice.

A. Department Review of Proposed Amendments. After compiling the preliminary docket during suggested amendment cycles, the director should make a recommendation as to which amendments suggested by citizens, agencies or city departments he or she believes should be placed on the final docket for consideration during the suggested amendment cycle.

B. Joint Workshop – Notice. During each suggested amendment cycle, the city council and planning commission may, but are not required to, hold a noticed joint workshop to serve as an informational meeting between the two governmental bodies. If held, notice of the joint workshop should be given by publication in the city’s official newspaper at least 10 days prior to the date of the workshop and by posting a copy of the workshop notice at City Hall, which shall include a statement of the purpose of the joint workshop.

C. Planning Commission Hearing. The planning commission shall hold a noticed public hearing on the preliminary docket. Following the hearing, the planning commission shall adopt a recommendation, identifying those amendments which it is recommending for city council consideration during each suggested amendment cycle. The planning commission shall take a vote on each suggested amendment to recommend or not recommend docketing to the city council. Recommendations on whether an item shall be included in the annual docket should be based on the following criteria:

1. The proposed amendment presents a matter appropriately addressed through the Comprehensive Plan; and

2. The proposed amendment can be reasonably reviewed within the available resources and time frame; and

3. The proposed amendment addresses significantly changed conditions or responds to an expressed desire by the community since the last time the pertinent Comprehensive Plan map or text was amended and thus warrants review in the current year; and

4. The proposed amendment is consistent with policy implementation in the county-wide planning policies, the Growth Management Act, other state or federal law, and the Washington Administrative Code.

The language of suggested amendments may not be modified at time of docketing. However, the planning commission may choose to docket additional or alternative suggested amendments provided such amendments are drafted in line-in/line-out bill format by the planning commission or staff. The planning commission’s recommendation should also include those proposed amendments coming out of its Comprehensive Plan assessment process. Notice of the planning commission hearing shall be given by publication in the city’s official newspaper at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing and by posting a copy of the hearing notice at City Hall, which shall include a statement of the purpose of the hearing.

b. Planning commission’s recommendation on the suggested amendments compiled by the director.

c. Recommended “update work program” containing the director’s recommended scope and schedule.

The council’s decision to place a proposed amendment on the final docket does not constitute a decision or recommendation that the proposed amendment should be adopted. No additional amendments may be considered after council adoption of the annual docket, with the exception of amendments to the capital facilities and utilities element or emergencies.
