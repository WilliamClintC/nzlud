PREFACE 
This Code is a republication of the ordinances of South Houston of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fifteenth section of Chapter 9 is 9-15. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-5 and 4-6 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-5.1, 4-5.2, 4-5.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice President of Production and Peggy Lamar, Editor, Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publishers are most grateful to Sylvia Ibarra, City Secretary, for her supervision, cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.

For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.  
Sec. 1-10. - Severability of parts of Code. 
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable and, if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the city council without the incorporation in this Code of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.

If the mayor fails or refuses to do so, the city council shall make such appointment on or before the next regular meeting of the city council, after that meeting in which the mayor fails or refuses to act by a majority vote thereof. All appointments are subject to the approval of a majority of city council. If, after six (6) months from the date of the vacancy, the mayor has failed to name a person acceptable to a majority of council mayor may be deemed by a two-third ( 2/3 ) majority of council to have failed or refused to fill the vacancy.

Editor's note Ordinance No. 2001-22, § 1, adopted November 6, 2001, did not specifically amend the Code. Such ordinance abolished the job position superintendent of street and bridge and created the supervisor of street and bridge.

Editor's note Exhibit A referred to above has not been included herein, but can be found on file with the city.  
Sec. 2-27. - City drug and alcohol testing policy. 
The following is the drug and alcohol testing policy for employees and certain volunteers of the city of South Houston: 
(1)  Drug/alcohol testing generally. The city shall conduct testing, in accordance with federal regulations, of commercial motor vehicle operators for use of alcohol or a controlled substance that violates law or federal regulation. The city shall also conduct random testing of all other city employees and conduct reasonable suspicion testing if it is believed that an employee has violated the city's prohibition against use of alcohol or controlled substances. 
(2)  Applicability: 
(a)  These testing requirements apply to every full-time or part-time city employee, fire department volunteers, and emergency medical service volunteers. 
(b)  All city employees are subject to random testing and reasonable suspicion testing if it is believed that an employee has violated the city's policy concerning prohibition against the use of alcohol or controlled substances. 
(3)  Testing procedures. The city shall ensure that all alcohol or controlled substances testing conducted under this policy complies with the procedures set forth in 49 C.F.R. Part 40. 
(4)  Notification. All city employees shall receive a copy of the city policy and administrative guidelines for controlled substance and alcohol testing. Each such employee shall sign an acknowledgment form indicating that prior notification material has been received and understood. 
(5)  Employee consent to alcohol or controlled substance testing: 
(a)  Prior to administration of an alcohol or controlled substance test, affected applicants and employees will be asked to sign a city consent form authorizing the test and permitting the release of test results to city officials. The consent form shall provide a space for individuals to acknowledge that they have been notified of the city's alcohol and controlled substance policy. 
(b)  Refusal to grant consent may result in nonemployment, reassignment, or termination of employment. 
(6)  Tests required. Required testing includes pre-employment, post-accident, random, reasonable suspicion, followup, and return-to-duty testing. No employee shall refuse to submit to a post-accident alcohol or controlled substances test, a random alcohol or controlled substances test, a reasonable suspicion alcohol or controlled substances test, or a followup alcohol or controlled substances test. An employee who refuses to submit to alcohol or controlled substance reasonable suspicion test shall be deemed to have violated city policy and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(7)  Pre-employment. As a condition of employment, a job applicant with the city shall receive a verified negative test result from a medical review officer for alcohol and controlled substances. 
(8)  Post-accident. As soon as practicable following an accident involving bodily injury, a commercial motor vehicle, a city-owned motor vehicle, or city-owned equipment the city shall test each employee: 
(a)  Who was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to the vehicle, if the accident involved the loss of human life, property damage, bodily injuries; and/or 
(b)  Who receives a citation under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident. 
An employee who is subject to post-accident testing shall remain readily available for such testing or may be deemed by the city to have refused to submit to testing. However, this provision shall not be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for injured people following an accident or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care. 
The city shall provide employees with necessary post-accident information, procedures, and instructions, prior to the employee's operating a city-owned motor vehicle of city-owned equipment, so that employees will be able to comply with these requirements. Post-accident testing is the primary responsibility of the employee. 
The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol or a urine test for the use of controlled substances, conducted by federal, state, or local officials having independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of this section, provided such tests conform to applicable federal, state, or local requirements, and that the results of the tests are obtained by the city. 
(9)  Random testing. The city shall randomly select a sufficient number of employees for controlled substance and alcohol testing during each calendar year. The percentage rates for alcohol and controlled substances may vary from year to year as determined by the mandate of the Omnibus Transportation Employees Testing Act of 1991. 
The selection of employees for random alcohol and controlled substances testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 
The city shall ensure that random alcohol and controlled substances tests conducted under this policy are unannounced and that the dates for administering random alcohol and controlled substances tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. 
Each employee who is notified of selection for random alcohol and/or controlled substances testing shall proceed to the test site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of notification, the city shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible. 
An employee shall be tested for alcohol only while the employee is performing job functions, just before the employee is to perform job functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. 
(10)  Reasonable suspicion: Alcohol. The city shall require an employee to submit to an alcohol test when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the city's policy regarding alcohol. The city's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to require the employee to undergo an alcohol test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee. 
For CDL drivers, reasonable suspicion alcohol testing may occur only if the required observations are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the workday that the employee is required to be in compliance with this policy and the employee is performing job functions, is about to perform job functions, or has just ceased performing such functions. 
All city employees shall be required to submit to an alcohol test when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has used or is using alcohol prior to reporting for duty or while on duty or prior to or while attending any city function on or off city property. 
(11)  Reasonable suspicion: Controlled substances. The city shall require an employee to submit to a controlled substances test when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions of this policy concerning controlled substances. The city's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to require the employee to undergo a controlled substances test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. 
A written record shall be made of the observations leading to a controlled substance reasonable suspicion test and signed by the supervisor who made the observations within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the controlled substances test are released, whichever is earlier. All city employees shall be required to submit to a controlled substance test where there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has used or is using a controlled substance prior to reporting for duty or while on duty, or prior to or while attending any city function on or off city property. 
(12)  Trained observers. For reasonable suspicion tests of any city employee authorized by this policy, the required observations for alcohol and/or controlled substances reasonable suspicion testing shall be made by a trained supervisor. The person who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists to conduct an alcohol test shall not conduct the alcohol test of the employee. Persons designed to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to require an employee to undergo testing shall receive at least sixty (60) minutes of training on alcohol misuse and receive at least an additional sixty (60) minutes of training on controlled substances use. The training shall cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances. 
(13)  Return-to-duty. In the event that an employee is allowed to return to duty, before an employee returns to duty after engaging in conduct prohibited by this policy concerning alcohol, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a negative result. 
In the event an employee is allowed to return, before an employee returns to duty after engaging in conduct prohibited by this policy concerning controlled substances, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty controlled substances test with a result indicating a verified negative result for controlled substances use. 
(14)  Followup. In the event an employee who has engaged in conduct prohibited in this policy or any other city policy regarding alcohol and controlled substances is allowed to return to work, and in the event a determination is made that an employee is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and/or use of controlled substances, the city shall ensure that the employee is subject to unannounced followup alcohol and/or controlled substances testing as directed by a substance abuse professional. 
Followup alcohol testing shall be conducted only when the employee is performing job functions, just before the employee is to perform job functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing job functions. 
(15)  Prohibitions: Alcohol. If any city employee tests positive for alcohol, no employee shall report for duty or remain on duty after having tested positively. The employee may be subject to termination. 
No city employee shall be on duty or operate a motor vehicle while the employee possesses alcohol. If the city has actual knowledge that the employee possesses alcohol, the employee shall not be permitted to drive or continue to drive a commercial motor vehicle. The city employee may be subject to termination. 
No employee shall use alcohol while performing job functions. If the city has actual knowledge that an employee is using alcohol while performing job functions, the employee shall not be permitted to perform or continue to perform job functions.

The employee shall be removed from his/her regularly assigned duties until an employment decision is made. The employee or other employee may be subject to termination. 
No employee required to take a post-accident alcohol test shall use alcohol for eight (8) hours following the accident or until he or she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test, whichever occurs first. 
(16)  Prohibitions: Controlled substances. No city employee shall report for duty or remain on duty when the employee uses any controlled substance, except when the use is pursuant to the instructions of a physician who has advised an employee that the substance does not adversely affect the employee's ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle, or with regard to any other employee when the employee has been advised that the substance does not adversely affect the employee's performance of regularly assigned duties. 
The city may require an employee to inform the employer of any therapeutic drug use. 
No city employee shall report for duty or remain on duty if the employee tests positive for controlled substances. If the city has actual knowledge that an employee has tested positive for controlled substances, the employee shall not be permitted to drive or continue to drive a commercial motor vehicle or to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions; or in the case of any other city employee, the employee shall be removed from his/her regularly assigned duties until an employment decision is made. The employee may be subject to termination. 
(17)  Consequences. With regard to commercial motor vehicle operators, consequences required by federal law for violating this policy include the following: 
(a)  Removal from job functions: 
1.  No employee shall perform job functions, including driving a motor vehicle or operating equipment, if the employee has engaged in conduct prohibited by this or other city policies regarding use of alcohol or controlled substances. 
2.  The city shall not permit any employee to perform safety-sensitive functions, including driving a commercial motor vehicle, if the city has determined that the employee has violated this policy. 
3.  In cases where an employee is also employed in a nondriving capacity by the city, disciplinary action imposed for violation of alcohol and controlled substances policies shall apply to the employee functions only. However, upon recommendation of the employee's supervisor, disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment with the city may be considered for nondriving functions. 
(b)  Required evaluation and testing. No employee who has engaged in conduct prohibited by this policy shall be permitted to perform any job functions, including driving a commercial motor vehicle, unless the employee has been referred for evaluation and treatment. 
(18)  Other alcohol-related coverage.

Except as provided above, the city may not take any action under this policy against an employee based solely on a positive test showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. This provision does not prohibit the city from taking any action otherwise consistent with law based on its own authority. 
(19)  Other penalties. Except as expressly provided in this policy, nothing in the federal regulations shall be construed to affect the authority of the city with respect to the use or possession of alcohol or the use of controlled substances, including authority and rights with respect to testing, rehabilitation, and other penalties.

(Ord. No. 94-015, § 1, 4-19-94)  
Sec. 2-87. - Rules of decorum. 
(a)  Members of the governing body. While the council is in session, all members of the governing body must preserve and maintain order and decorum. 
(1)  Subject matter. Every member desiring to speak shall confine discussion to the question under debate, avoiding all personalities and indecorous language. 
(2)  Interruptions. A member of the city council shall not be interrupted while speaking. 
(3)  No member of the governing body shall speak during the citizens' hearing, except as herein permitted, and all members shall refrain from making expressly impertinent, slanderous, discourteous or profane remarks and shall not willfully utter loud, threatening or abusive language, nor engage in any disorderly conduct which would impede, disrupt, or disturb the orderly conduct of any meeting, hearing, or other proceedings. 
(4)  No member of the governing body shall violate any portion of section 2-87, as amended, including, but not limited to, subsection (a)(1) styled "subject matter" which says; "Every member desiring to speak shall confine discussion to the question under debate, avoiding all personalities and indecorous language." This quoted portion of subsection (a)(1) is interpreted to apply to all other portions of the agenda when the public is restricted from speaking. 
(b)  Persons addressing council. Any resident may address council during the citizens' hearing portions of any agenda. Addressing council means that comments shall be directed to council, not questions asked of council. Those who are permitted to address council do not include members of the governing body. This is for citizens, as distinguished from council members, because council members are not restricted to one part of the agenda and they have adequate time to speak during the rest of the meeting when the public is not allowed to speak. The public only has these two (2) agenda positions to make their desires known to council. The citizens' hearing for agenda items to be limited to five (5) minutes from the time he or she commences talking. The citizens' hearing for nonagenda items to be limited to three (3) minutes from the time he or she commences talking. No council member shall be permitted to speak or interrupt during the citizens' hearing portion of the agenda, without the consent of a majority of council, unless an express exception applies, and his or her attempt to speak during the citizens' hearing shall be out of order. These are the exceptions: 
(1)  The mayor may speak on parliamentary procedure and shall speak to preserve order. During the citizens' hearing portion of the agenda, the mayor shall confine his or her comments to the ceremonial aspects of his or her role and to matters pertaining to how the meeting shall proceed. On any item other than a discussion of procedure or reasonable and valid point of order, he or she shall not permit a council member to speak without the approval of a majority of council. 
(2)  A council person may speak to exercise his or her right to remove a disorderly member of the audience, allowed herein and to raise points of parliamentary procedure on a valid point of order. 
(3)  A council person may speak about removal of violators of decorum rules and during and about parliamentary matters dealing with rulings or actions by the presiding officer, but not otherwise. 
Any member of the public making expressly impertinent, slanderous, discourteous or profane remarks or who willfully utters loud, threatening or abusive language, or who engages in any disorderly conduct which would impede, disrupt, or disturb the orderly conduct of any meeting, hearing, or other proceedings, shall be called to order by any member of the governing body, and if such conduct continues, may, at the discretion of any member of the governing body, be removed and barred from further audience before the council during the meeting. Such removal power shall not be exercised to eject from the meeting a voting member of council, or any officer, employee or consultant, for the city scheduled to assist council (as part of his or her job) in meetings to make a presentation or give testimony about a particular agenda item on the agenda when that agenda item is under deliberation, at the meeting at which he or she is in attendance. Physical intimidation, taunts, threats or similar menacing conduct shall not be tolerated from a member of the audience or from a member of the governing body. If a mayor or member of council persists in such unacceptable behavior, he or she may be publicly censured by council and council may pursue other remedies until such conduct ceases or that person is no longer a member of council. The remedy for boorish and/or menacing behavior in a public official shall be reprimand, censure, impeachment or removal from office but not removal from a meeting at which he or she has a right to vote, unless he or she commits a breach of the peace or a violation of the Texas Penal Code. In other words, this section shall not be used to remove such an official, but there are limits to such conduct that may justify removal. 
(c)  Members of the audience. No person in the audience shall engage in disorderly conduct such as hand clapping, stamping of feet, whistling, use of profane or vulgar language, yelling, holding placards and similar demonstrations, which conduct disturbs the peace and good order of the meeting. 
(d)  Persons authorized to be within certain area. No person except members of the council and the city staff shall be permitted past the speaker's stand without the consent of the presiding officer or a majority vote of council members in attendance. 
(e)  No member of the public shall violate any portion of section 2-87 of the South Houston Code, as amended. 
(f)  It shall be unlawful to violate any provision of this section and the penalties shall be those provided for ordinance violation in the City Code. 
(g)  The provisions of this section are severable. If any portion is declared to be unenforceable, the remaining portions shall be enforceable. 
(Ord. No. 94-015, § 1, 4-19-94; Ord. No. 97-018, §§ 15, 7-22-97; Ord. No. 97-020, §§ 15, 8-5-97)  
Sec. 2-88. - Lighting for cameras and recording devices. 
Supplemental lighting for television and motion picture cameras shall be used only with the exercise of extreme discretion with regard to the intensity and duration of such lighting and with a view to creating the least amount of interference with or disturbance of the proceedings of the council and the least amount of discomfort to council members and the public in attendance. The majority of council members shall have the authority to determine whether the intensity and/or duration of supplemental lighting is such that it disturbs the proceedings of the council and upon making such a determination require that the use of such lighting be discontinued.

Auto wrecker. The term "auto wrecker" shall mean any automobile, truck or other vehicle (which is) used for the purposes of towing, carrying, pushing, or otherwise transporting any motor vehicle for whatever the reason may be. "The term auto wrecker" shall not be construed to include a service car or other vehicle not equipped with mechanical devices for transporting wrecked vehicles and not used for such purpose, such as service cars equipped with compressed air containers and tools for performing minor repairs not involving towage or transportation of vehicles. This exception shall not authorize evasion of this chapter, and if any vehicle, although not equipped with devices primarily used for towing vehicles, is actually used for such purposes through means of ropes, chains or otherwise, the same shall be considered an auto wrecker within the terms of this chapter. No auto wrecker license shall be required for those franchised utility companies who own and operate their own auto wreckers for towing their own equipment. 
Emergency auto wrecker. The term "emergency auto wrecker" shall mean an auto wrecker which is dispatched to the scene of an accident by the chief of police or his representative from the wrecker rotation list, where a vehicle has collided with another vehicle or other object or has been wrecked or disabled in any manner, for the purpose or expectation of towing, removing or hauling away the wrecked vehicle or vehicles from the scene of the accident or to remove a vehicle through the authority of the police department. 
Person. The term "person" shall include both singular and plural and shall mean and include any individual, firm, corporation, association or partnership. 
Owner. The term "owner" shall be construed to mean any person engaged in the business of towing motor vehicles for hire or engaged in the business of storing, wrecking or repairing motor vehicles for hire and who owns or is entitled to use any auto wrecker or emergency auto wrecker, and who uses same in the conduct of his business or any part thereof.

(a)  Upon complaint being filed by any person with the chief of police of a violation by the holder of an auto wrecker or emergency auto wrecker permit of any of the terms or provisions of this chapter or the violation of any applicable laws of the state, federal government or other ordinances of the city, or upon his own motion, the chief of police shall, after fifteen (15) days' written notice to the permit holder of the grounds of such complaint or his own motion, conduct a hearing to hear evidence with reference to such complaint or motion. Should such hearing reveal a violation of any of the terms of this chapter or the laws of this state or the federal government or other ordinances of the city, the chief of police may suspend, cancel or revoke the permit or permits of such permit holder as the offense may direct. 
(b)  After the chief of police has conducted the hearing and investigation upon the complaint or motion for the suspension, cancellation or revocation of the permit of any owner of an auto wrecker or emergency auto wrecker permit, he shall make his findings and declare the same in writing to the owner or operator of such permit within fifteen (15) days after such hearing. The owner of such auto wrecker or emergency auto wrecker permit shall have the right to appeal to the city council within ten (10) days from the receipt of the written decision of the chief of police only in the event of a revocation, cancellation or suspension of more than ten (10) days' duration of the permit. Such appeal shall be perfected by a letter to the mayor and city council, delivered to the city secretary stating that an appeal is desired from such action of the chief of police. Upon receiving such appeal, city council as soon as practicable thereafter shall notify the appellant as to whether or not such an appeal will be heard and if council approves such an appeal, they then may hear such appeal and shall either sustain or reverse the revocation of the chief of police. If no appeal is taken from the chief of police's action within ten (10) days as set out above, then the decision of the chief of police shall be final. In the event the city council refuses to hear the appeal, the action of the chief of police shall be deemed administratively final within one day after the date of refusal.

The auto wrecker driver or emergency auto wrecker driver and vehicle owner shall file such written request with the chief of police forthwith. 
(b)  The fact that no police officer of the city is present at the scene of the accident when an emergency auto wrecker or an auto wrecker, which has been summoned to the scene by the vehicle owner, arrives shall not constitute an exception to this section, and it shall be the duty of any owner or driver of a wrecker desiring to tow or haul any wrecked or disabled vehicle from the scene of the accident to cause the police department of the city to be notified of the occurrence of the accident and to wait the arrival of a police officer of the city and the completion of his investigation. 
(c)  In the event that the driver of a wrecked or disabled vehicle has been rendered unable by the accident to give permission to an emergency auto wrecker driver to remove the wrecked or disabled vehicle, or has absented himself from the scene of the accident, the investigating police officer shall notify the dispatcher at the police department of such fact and such officer shall give such orders as may be necessary to remove the wrecked or disabled vehicle from the street, which orders shall direct that such vehicle, upon removal, shall be taken and placed in an appropriate locked enclosure, located within the city limits, for storage.

ARTICLE IV. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 6-71. - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of South Houston, Texas, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 747, Art. 1, § A, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 1, § A, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 1, § A, 12-13-16; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 1, § A, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-72. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of South Houston are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from damage. 
(Ord. No. 747, Art. 1, § B, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 1, § B, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 1, § B, 12-13-16; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 1, § B, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-73. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 747, Art. 1, § C, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 1, § C, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 1, § C, 12-13-16; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 1, § C, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-74. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, the ordinance codified in this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding).

(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 6-93(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (section 6-73). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: (i) the criteria outlined in subsections (a)(i) of this section are met; and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(Ord. No. 747, Art. 5, § A, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 5, § A, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 5, § A, 12-13-15; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 5, § A, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-102. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in: (i) section 6-77; (ii) subsection 6-92(8); or (iii) subsection 6-103(c), the following provisions are required. 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in subsection 6-93(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two (2) openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottoms of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.

This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no fewer than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: (i) be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of subsection 6-93(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 747, Art. 5, § B, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 5, § B, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 5, § B, 12-13-15; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 5, § B, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-103. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with sections 6-72, 6-73, and 6-74 of this article. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of section 6-78; section 6-93; and the provisions of division 5 of this article. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 6-77 or subsection 6-92(8) of this article. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 747, Art. 5, § C, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 5, § C, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 5, § C, 12-13-15; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 5, § C, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-104. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 6-77, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 6-93, are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 747, Art. 5, § D, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 5, § D, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 5, § D, 12-13-15; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 5, § D, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-105. - Floodways. 
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazards established in section 6-77, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division 5. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 747, Art. 5, § E, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 96-020, Art. 5, § E, 10-29-96; Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 5, § E, 12-13-15; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 5, § E, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-106. - Severability. 
If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of the ordinance codified in this article is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2016-29, Art. 5, § F, 12-13-15; Ord. No. 2018-06 , Art. 5, § F, 5-8-18)  
Sec. 6-107. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this court order and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court order or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of South Houston from taking other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

ARTICLE V. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note Ordinance No. 2002-02, §§ IXXVII, adopted March 26, 2002, did not specifically amend the Code. Therefore, this ordinance was treated as amending article V to read as herein set out. Formerly, such article pertained to similar provisions and derived from Ord. No. 94-018, §§ 122 4-19-94. 
 
Sec. 12-67. - Authority, findings, purpose, and intent. 
(a)  These regulations are promulgated pursuant to and in conformity with Chapter 243 of the Local Government Code of Texas, as amended. The City Council of South Houston makes the following findings: 
(1)  That sexually oriented businesses require special supervision in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of the communities where they locate; 
(2)  That permitting sexually oriented businesses is a legitimate means of accountability to help ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to help ensure that enterprise operators do not knowingly or carelessly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation; 
(3)  That sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have objectionable operational characteristics, especially when they are located in proximity to each other. Such proximity contributes to urban blight and downgrades the quality of life in adjacent areas; 
(4)  That sexually oriented businesses can exert dehumanizing influences on churches, schools, and day-care centers; have negative effects on property values; can contribute to increased criminal activities in surrounding areas and exert the same types of negative community influences on other forms of land uses; 
(5)  That a distance of one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet for sexually oriented businesses from various types of establishments will help provide additional protection to the community from the adverse effects of sexually oriented businesses without depriving such businesses of adequate opportunities to locate within incorporated areas of the City of South Houston, Texas; and 
(6)  That the City Council of South Houston wants to help prevent adverse effects caused by sexually oriented businesses. The council also desires to help protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry; help protect the public from increased crime; help preserve the quality of life; help preserve property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods, and help deter the spread of urban blight. 
(b)  It is the intent of the City of South Houston to exercise its regulatory powers permitted under Chapter 243 of the Local Government Code and to enact a content neutral order that addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses. The City of South Houston desires to establish reasonable and uniform regulations of sexually oriented businesses to promote and protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of South Houston. The City Council of South Houston also desires to prohibit activities that merely serve as a front for activities prohibited by the Texas Penal Code, including, but not limited to, prostitution and the promotion of prostitution. 
(c)  These regulations have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction of the content of any communicative material, including sexually oriented material. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented material protected by the First Amendment of the United States, to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market or to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment. The promotion of obscene material (not protected by the First Amendment) can be prosecuted through separate criminal sanctions under the penal code. 
(d)  These regulations do not legalize anything prohibited under the Texas Penal Code or any other law or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § I, 3-26-02)  
Sec. 12-68. - Administration. 
(a)  The City Council of South Houston, Texas, hereby designates and directs the Chief of Police of the City of South Houston, Texas, or his/her duly authorized representative(s) ("executive director") to accept applications for a sexually oriented business permit and to certify compliance with the location requirements. The City of South Houston also directs the Chief of Police of the City of South Houston to investigate, deny, issue, attach conditions to, and to suspend and revoke sexually oriented business permits (SOBPs) pursuant to the above authority and these regulations. 
(b)  The executive director may enforce these regulations. An appeal shall not automatically stay the effect of the executive director's determination. The chief of police and the South Houston Police Department are authorized to investigate sexually oriented businesses' service records and to investigate and enforce the provisions of this ordinance as set forth herein. 
Pursuant to Section 243.007(c) of the Local Government Code, the District Court has jurisdiction over a suit that arises from the denial, suspension or revocation of an SOBP by the county. 
Sections 243.010(a) and (b) of the Local Government Code, as amended, authorize the State of Texas to prosecute a violation of these regulations as a class A misdemeanor. 
The revocation or suspension of an SOBP shall not prohibit the imposition of a criminal penalty and the imposition of a criminal penalty shall not prevent the revocation or suspension of an SOBP pursuant to these regulations.

(4)  The SOBP should not have been issued pursuant to these regulations; or 
(5)  The enterprise operator commits or is convicted of a criminal offense listed in subsections 12-80(e)(4)a.j. of these regulations.

Subject to a request for hearing pursuant to this section, the revocation shall become final on the eleventh (11 th ) business day after notice is provided pursuant to these regulations. 
(c)  The SOBE or its designated agent shall have the opportunity to appear before a hearing examiner appointed by the mayor upon written request submitted to the executive director within ten (10) business days of delivery of the notice of revocation. The hearing examiner shall not have participated in any investigation of the alleged grounds for the revocation.

The SOBE and the executive director will be provided an opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. They also may be represented by legal counsel. The rules of civil evidence for a non-jury trial shall apply. 
(d)  Upon finding that the facts presented at the hearing support a finding that grounds exist for revoking or suspending the SOBP, the hearing examiner may request that the parties present relevant evidence to show whether suspension or revocation of the SOBP is more appropriate. The hearing examiner may also request that evidence be presented for the purpose of identifying appropriate conditions to be attached to an SOBP if the SOBP is suspended. Reasonable conditions may be attached to an SOBP by the hearing examiner based on the evidence presented at the hearing. 
(e)  If the hearing examiner determines that an SOBP should be revoked, the hearing examiner shall issue a written order revoking the SOBP when notice is provided to the enterprise operator pursuant to these regulations. 
(f)  If the hearing examiner determines, based upon the nature of the violations, that a suspension in lieu of revocation is appropriate, operation of the SOBP may be suspended for a period of time not to exceed two (2) weeks. The hearing examiner shall issue a written order suspending the SOBP and attaching conditions, if applicable, upon notice to the enterprise operator pursuant to these regulations. 
(g)  Revocation shall be subject to the hearing provisions of this section. But revocation shall take immediate effect upon notice being sent, subject to reinstatement resulting from appeal, when there is a necessity for immediate action to protect the public from injury or imminent danger.

(c)  If a notice given by mail is returned by the postal service as undeliverable, it will be presumed the enterprise operator did not comply with the affirmative duty to notify the executive director of any change of address. This presumption may be rebutted by the enterprise owner's showing there was an error on the part of the post office. 
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § XVI, 3-26-02)  
Sec. 12-83. - Temporary SOBP provisions. 
If the executive director fails to take action on an application within the times specified, or if the hearing officer fails to timely conduct or give notice of the decision after the hearing, the applicant shall be entitled to an immediate issuance of a temporary SOBP upon written demand. The applicant must file the demand with the executive director. A temporary SOBP shall be valid only until notice of the executive director's action on the application or the hearing examiner's order.

(e)  If a renewal application is submitted fewer than fifteen (15) days before the previous SOBP expires, there shall be no temporary SOBP issued to extend the SOBP. The original SOBP will expire and, until the executive director's determination on renewal, there will be no valid SOBP for operation during that period. Upon expiration of an SOBP, the City of South Houston, Texas, shall mail a notice to the SOBE advising that the SOBP has expired. Such notice shall be mailed to the SOBE within five (5) days of the expiration of the SOBP. The SOBE shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt to renew its expired SOBP.

Upon the filing of a new application and fee, and posting the application with the prior SOBP, the SOBE may continue to operate until the final determination on the new SOBP. In no application is filed within forty-five (45) days after the death of the SOBP holder, the SOBE shall be in violation of these regulations each and every day it continues to operate without a new SOBP. 
(b)  If an SOBE had been previously permitted under any prior enacted SOB ordinance or regulation, its permit may be transferred to a new operator upon notification to the Executive Director by submitting an SOBP transfer form and payment of a one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00) transfer fee. A transference of an existing SOBP must qualify as a new applicant for an SOBP. 
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § XXI, 3-26-02)  
Sec. 12-88. - Lost or destroyed SOBP. 
(a)  If an SOBP is lost or destroyed, a replacement may be obtained by filing a lost SOBP application and paying a lost permit fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
(b)  A replacement SOBP will be issued immediately upon confirmation of the identity of the applicant through the executive director's records. A replacement permit will expire on the same date as the original permit. 
(c)  It shall not be a defense to prosecution for conducting business without an SOBP that an SOBP was lost or stolen. An SOBE may not conduct business as an SOBE, in the areas covered under these regulations, until a replacement SOBP is obtained. 
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § XXII, 3-26-02)  
Sec. 12-89. - Operating requirements for enterprises. 
(a)  The following shall be violations of these regulations punishable as authorized in Section 243.010(b) of the Local Government Code. Each day a violation continues constitutes and is punishable as a separate offense:

(a)  Evidence that a sleeping room in a hotel, motel, or similar commercial establishment has been rented and vacated two (2) or more times in a period of time that is less than twelve (12) hours creates a rebuttable presumption that the establishment is an SOBE adult motel under these regulations if the motel also provides patrons with closed-circuit television transmissions, films, motion pictures, video cassettes, slides, or other reproductions which are characterized by the depiction or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas as defined in this section. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, the terms "rent" or "sub-rent" mean the act of allowing a room to be occupied for any form of consideration.

ARTICLE VII. - RESIDENCES OF SEXUAL OFFENDERS 
 
Sec. 12-151. - Findings and intent. 
That repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 1, 7-11-06)

Temporary residence means a place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for a period of fourteen (14) or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's permanent address or a place where the person routinely abides, resides, or lodges for a period of four (4) or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent residence. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 7-11-06)  
Sec. 12-153. - Sexual offenders' residence prohibition; penalties; exceptions. 
(a)  If a person is required to register on the Texas Department of Public Safety's sex offender database, it is unlawful for that person to establish a permanent residence or temporary residence within one thousand (1,000) feet of any premises where children commonly gather, including but not limited to, a school, day-care facility, playground, public or private youth center, neighborhood or public swimming pool, or video arcade facility, as those terms are defined in V.T.C.A. Health and Safety Code of the State of Texas § 481.134. It shall be prima facie evidence that this section applies to such a person if the person's record appears on the database. 
(b)  For the purpose of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer or nearest property line of the permanent or temporary residence to the outer or nearest property line of the premises where children commonly gather, as described herein. A map generally depicting the prohibited areas or zones is attached to this article for representation purposes. The city shall review this map at least annually for changes. 
(c)  In cases of dispute over measured distances, it shall be incumbent upon the person(s) challenging the measurement to prove otherwise. 
(d)  Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation that violates this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(e)  Exceptions. A person residing within one thousand (1,000) feet of those places where children commonly gather, as specified herein, does not commit a violation of this article if any of the following apply: 
(1)  The person established the permanent or temporary residence and has complied with all the sex offender registration laws of the State of Texas prior to the date of the adoption of this article. 
(2)  The person was a minor when he/she committed the offense and was not convicted as an adult. 
(3)  The person is a minor. 
(4)  The premises where children commonly gather, as specified herein, within one thousand (1,000) feet of the person's permanent or temporary residence was opened after the person established the permanent or temporary residence and complied with all sex offender registration laws of the State of Texas.

The overturning moment produced from lateral forces shall in no case exceed two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the deal load resisting moment for all signs. Uplift due to overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structural frame of the building for all signs. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead-load resisting moment such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly compacted. 
(2)  Wind loads. All signs and sign structures shall be designed to resist wind loads as follows: 
Wind Load Pressures in Pounds per Square Foot for All Signs 
Height Above Ground*, Feet 	Pressure, Pounds/Sq. Ft. 
050 	30 
 
*Measured above the average level of the ground adjacent to the structure. 
(3)  Vertical design loads. Vertical design loads, except roof live loads, shall be assumed to be acting simultaneously with the wind loads.

(Ord. No. 2000-13, §§ 14, 10-30-00)  
Sec. 19-26. - Paving of public alley. 
(a)  Finding that alleys shall not be paved without preapproval, including an acceptable drainage and paving plan. The city council finds that the unpaved public alleys of the city shall not be paved or permitted to be paved by abutting lot owners or any other persons, firms or corporations unless the paving is conducted entirely pursuant to a permit granted by the city, after an acceptable drainage and paving plan for the paved area and its surroundings has been filed with and approved by the city, and then only if the paving is done in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with city paving specifications and is paid entirely by the person, firm or corporation seeking such paving approval. 
(b)  Prohibition against unauthorized paving of an alley and establishing criteria for a paving permit. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to pave or cause to be paved a public alley in the City of South Houston, Texas, unless and until the paving has been approved by the city and the permit fee has been paid. And it shall be unlawful for a person, firm or corporation who has obtained a permit to pave an alley, to allow the paved alleyway to fall into disrepair. Should the alley fall into disrepair and should the permit holder for the paving fail to promptly repair same upon written notice, the city may perform the repairs and charge them, and its attorney's fees for that action, if any, to the applicant/permit holder; and those charges shall be promptly paid to the city in reimbursement. A condition precedent to the issuance of such a paving permit shall be the requirement that the applicant for the permit shall file, or cause to be filed, a drainage and paving plan from a registered professional engineer (bearing his/her professional seal) for the alley and its surrounding properties that assures the city that the normal sheet flow of surface drainage for the unpaved area shall not be adversely impacted in any way by this paving project. The failure to file such a plan showing no such impact shall be grounds for denial of the permit. The city may charge a reasonable administrative fee for this discretionary program. Another condition precedent for such an approval shall be the assumption of financial responsibility for all paving costs and inspection costs from the city, so that the net effect of this approval shall be at no cost to the city for the project. Finally, the application for the permit shall contain these conditions precedent, shall be agreed to and accepted by the applicant and shall further state and applicant shall agree that in the event that the city must excavate the area paved in the future for a public purpose such as, but not limited to, the removal or replacement or repair of buried utility equipment, lines, cables or apparatus of any kind, the city shall not be responsible for the repair of the excavated area and the applicant shall indemnify the city for and shall promptly pay for such costs. Such a commitment and assurance to the city for this permitted encroachment may be incorporated into a consent to encroachment agreement to be signed by the applicant and the city, but even if no such separate agreement is executed, the conditions and terms of the consent by the city for this paving shall be governed by this section with or without such a signed consent to encroachment agreement. The person, firm or corporation who paves the alley or who causes it to be paved, or who parks on the paved alleyway, shall never acquire any ownership or right to park or use the paved area in the alley. This shall be a privilege and not a right and this privilege may be withheld or withdrawn if the applicant or user fails to meet all the ordinance requirements, including, but not limited to, the continuing obligation to maintain the alleyway paved in a good state of repair. The cessation of use by the applicant/user shall not terminate any continuing responsibility of the applicant for the continued maintenance and repair of the paving unless and until the city permanently removes said paving at applicant's expense. 
(c)  Penalty. It shall be unlawful to violate any provision of this section and the penalty shall be the applicable penalty provided for ordinance violation in the City Code.

Sec. 22-22. - Duty of driver approaching stop or yield sign. 
(a)  Except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic-control signal, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign at an intersection shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, in the event there is no crosswalk, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. After having so stopped, such driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is approaching so closely on said highway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving across or within the intersection. 
(b)  The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in obedience to such sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection. If required for safety, such driver shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, in the event there is no crosswalk at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. If a driver is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection, after driving past a yield sign without stopping, such collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his failure to yield right-of-way.

State Law reference Similar provisions, V.T.C.A., Transportation Code § 544.004.  
Sec. 22-43. - Traffic-control signal legend generally. 
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(a)  Green indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn, but vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(b)  Steady yellow indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(c)  Steady red indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and may then turn right or, if the intersecting streets are both one-way streets and left turns are permissible, may turn left, after standing until the intersection may be entered safely, yielding right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection, unless signs are in place indicating that such turns are prohibited, in which case vehicular traffic facing such red signal shall remain standing until the green signal is shown. Traffic not so turning shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. 
(2)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable, except as to those provisions which, by their nature, can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

Sec. 22-44. - Flashing signals. 
Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows: 
(1)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway, before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through an intersection or past such signal only with caution.

Each license location shall have a drive aisle at least eighteen (18) feet wide that extends from the public right-of-way into the property a distance adequate to allow the efficient and effective operation of fire apparatus, but in no event less than fifteen (15) feet into the property. Such lane design, which may overlap with any portion of the sixteen- or twenty-four-foot-wide drive aisle required by the preceding subparagraph, shall require approval of the fire marshal during the permit review process, and upon approval shall be plainly marked to prohibit parking thereon or obstruction thereof in any way. 
For purpose of this subparagraph, a vehicle has "direct access" to a drive aisle if it is either parked beside a drive aisle or parked immediately adjacent to a vehicle that is parked beside a drive aisle. 
(11)  All vehicles displayed for sale must maintain a minimum distance of twenty-four (24) inches from any point of any other vehicle displayed for sale.

The use of any other lot for automobile storage in conjunction with the dealer location for sales is a use as a dealer location and therefore is hereby prohibited unless it is more than five thousand (5,000) feet from any used motor vehicle dealer location (including the location it serves). 
No owner or tenant of a property devoted to used motor vehicle dealer sales lot use shall fence or barricade the area fronting a thoroughfare between the thoroughfare and the footprint of the first structure on the lot. 
(14)  All repair and service building shall: 
a.  Be set back no fewer than twenty-five (25) feet from the front property line and five (5) feet from rear property lines and no fewer than five (5) feet from any side property line, and 
b.  All exterior lighting shall be designed to prevent direct glare on adjoining properties and shall be generally situated to cast light away from perimeter areas of said used car lot. All lighting plans shall be submitted for approval to the City of South Houston's Electrical Inspector. Such approval is not only a review of regulatory mandates, but also will signify the most practical solution to avoiding light pollution on adjacent properties by the following methods: location of lighting standards, direction and angle of lighting, height of fixtures, candle power of each light fixture, and light spreading hardware. 
c.  Each new license location is required to be a minimum of one thousand (1,000) feet from any existing license location as measured from nearest property line to nearest property line.

(c)  Inspection. Prior to original connection, reconnection or transfer of water and/or sewer service to a tenant or property owner, the city at its option shall inspect the customer's private sanitary sewer service line and verify the integrity thereof. Any defects discovered in the private line shall be repaired by the property owner or his agent prior to obtaining original connection, reconnection or transfer of city water and/or sewer service. The city has already surveyed and identified existing infiltration and inflow on private sanitary sewer lines and will continue to inspect private lines suspected of infiltration and inflow. 
(d)  Notification. 
(1)  The utilities department of the city will notify in writing by registered mail return receipt requested each property owner on whose property a source of inflow or infiltration of water into the city's sanitary sewer system exists, as well as the nature and location of the sources.

*A homeowner may install or maintain plumbing and/or sewer equipment within his owner property boundaries, provided that the work is done by himself and used exclusively by him or his family. Such privilege does not convey the right to violate any provision of this code nor is it to be construed as exempting any such property owner from obtaining a permit and paying the required fees therefor. 
(3)  After the repair has been completed and before it has been covered, the city plumbing inspection department shall be notified to inspect and approve its adequacy and workmanship. If the city plumbing inspector leaves a green tag signifying a satisfactory repair, the plumber or owner may replace the cover. 
(4)  However, if the city plumbing inspector leaves a red tag, the plumber or owner must contact the designated city official on the red tag and correct the repairs as specified and then notify the city plumbing inspection department to reinspect the corrected repairs. No cover may be replaced until a green tag is attached to the repairs by the city plumbing inspection department. Otherwise owner and/or plumber shall be required to excavate and the city shall reinspect the repairs, and if still defective turn off water and/or sewer service. 
(f)  Penalties. 
(1)  Should the property owner fail to make the necessary repairs within the three-month period as set out above, the city shall have the option of thereafter (1) assessing a surcharge fee to his monthly wastewater charge (the charge shall be determined by the city's existing formula for calculating domestic wastewater charges) or (2) terminating water and/or sewer service to the property.

(3)  Within thirty (30) days after notification that the water and/or sewer will be cut off, the customer may: 
a.  Arrange with the utility department to extend his payout period without interest up to sixty (60) months with said monthly payment added to his regular water/sewer bill; or 
b.  Appeal to the city council for a hardship variance. Said appeal shall be submitted in writing to the mayor's office for hearing at a regular scheduled council meeting. 
(4)  If the property owner is unknown or does not pay the charge, the city shall file a lien upon the land for the cost of the repair and a fine for the extraneous water disposed of through the city's sanitary sewer system and wastewater treatment plant. 
(g)  Appeals. Appeals shall be to the city council. Said appeal shall be within ten (10) days of the expiration of the thirty-day notification. The burden of proof shall be on the customer to prove that he has complied with this section.

(2)  The pollution abatement officer may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 24-110 of this ordinance or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 24-114 of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-124. - Reports of potential problems. 
(a)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the pollution abatement officer of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the pollution abatement officer, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-125. - Reports from unpermitted users. 
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the pollution abatement officer as the pollution abatement officer may require. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-126. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the pollution abatement officer within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the pollution abatement officer within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the pollution abatement officer monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the pollution abatement officer samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-127. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 24-123 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 24-119, 24-121, and 24-122 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the pollution abatement officer, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-128. - Analytical requirements. 
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-129. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in section (b), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the pollution abatement officer may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-130. - Timing. 
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-131. - Record keeping. 
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City of South Houston, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the pollution abatement officer. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-132. - Right of entry: inspection and sampling. 
The pollution abatement officer shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the pollution abatement officer ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the pollution abatement officer will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The pollution abatement officer shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The pollution abatement officer may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a minimum of one time per year to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the pollution abatement officer and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the pollution abatement officer access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-133. - Search warrants. 
If the pollution abatement officer has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City of South Houston designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the pollution abatement officer may seek issuance of a search warrant. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-134. - Confidential information. 
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, inspections, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the pollution abatement officer inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pollution abatement officer, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. Any such information deemed to be confidential shall be stamped with the words "confidential business information" on each page. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98; Ord. No. 2005-34, § 1, 10-18-05)  
Sec. 24-135. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
The pollution abatement officer shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the pollution abatement officer believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the pollution abatement officer exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) which the pollution abatement officer determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-136. - Enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the pollution abatement officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pollution abatement officer may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the pollution abatement officer. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the pollution abatement officer to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The pollution abatement officer may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections 24-136(d) and (e) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The pollution abatement officer may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the pollution abatement officer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the pollution abatement officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pollution abatement officer may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the pollution abatement officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the pollution abatement officer may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the pollution abatement officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pollution abatement officer may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten (10) percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of seven (7) percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the pollution abatement officer to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the pollution abatement officer may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The pollution abatement officer may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The pollution abatement officer may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The pollution abatement officer may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the pollution abatement officer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The pollution abatement officer may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pollution abatement officer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection 24-136(h) of this article are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the pollution abatement officer prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections 24-136(c) or 24-136(h) of this article. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 24-116 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections 24-95 through 24-99 of this article. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 24-136(c) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the pollution abatement officer shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-137. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the pollution abatement officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pollution abatement officer may petition the through the City of South Houston's City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The pollution abatement officer may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City of South Houston for a maximum civil penalty of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The pollution abatement officer may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City of South Houston. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit; or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation, per day. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per day per violation. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The pollution abatement officer may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City of South Houston enforcement response plan. However, the pollution abatement officer may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the pollution abatement officer is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-138. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Performance bonds. The pollution abatement officer may decline to issue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City of South Houston, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the pollution abatement officer to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(b)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-139. - Act of God defense. 
(a)  The act of God defense constitutes a statutory affirmative defense [V.T.C.A. Water Code, § 7.251] in an action brought in municipal or state court. If a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under the ordinance, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of the ordinance or permit. 
(b)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the act of God affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through relevant evidence, that: 
(1)  An event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under the ordinance occurred, and the sole cause of the event was an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe; and 
(2)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the city within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under the ordinance (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days); and 
a.  A description of the event, and the nature and cause of the event; 
b.  The time period of the event, including exact dates and times or, if still continuing, the anticipated time the event is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the event. 
(c)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the act of God affirmative defense shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under the ordinance, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98; Ord. No. 2005-34, § 1, 10-18-05)  
Sec. 24-140. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 24-95(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in subsection 24-95(b) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City of South Houston was regularly in compliance with its NPDES or state discharge permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)  
Sec. 24-141. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the pollution abatement officer, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the pollution abatement officer of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The pollution abatement officer may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the pollution abatement officer may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2)  The pollution abatement officer may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the pollution abatement officer determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

[Reserved] 
(Ord. No. 98-001, § 2, 2-24-98)

ARTICLE IV. - SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY[4] 
ORDINANCE NO. 942 4-92 
AN ORDINANCE WHEREBY THE CITY OF SOUTH HOUSTON, TEXAS, AND SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY AGREE THAT, FOR THE PURPOSE OF OPERATING ITS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, THE TELEPHONE COMPANY SHALL MAINTAIN AND CONSTRUCT ITS POLES, WIRES, ANCHORS, FIBER, CABLES, MANHOLES, CONDUITS AND OTHER PHYSICAL PLANT AND APPURTENANCES IN, ALONG, ACROSS, ON, OVER, THROUGH, ABOVE AND UNDER ALL PUBLIC STREETS AVENUES, HIGHWAYS, ALLEYS, SIDEWALKS, BRIDGES OR PUBLIC PROPERTY IN SAID CITY; PRESCRIBING THE ANNUAL COMPENSATION DUE THE CITY UNDER THIS ORDINANCE; PRESCRIBING THE CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTION WORK ON PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR THE TELEPHONE COMPANY'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS; PROVIDING AN INDEMNITY CLAUSE; SPECIFYING GOVERNING LAWS; PROVIDING FOR A RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS UNDER PRIOR ORDINANCES; PROVIDING FOR FUTURE CONTINGENCIES; PROVIDING FOR WRITTEN ACCEPTANCE OF THIS ORDINANCE BY THE TELEPHONE COMPANY; AND PROVIDING FOR A TERM AND AN EFFECTIVE DATE. 
WHEREAS, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (hereinafter referred to as the "telephone company") is now and has been engaged in the telecommunications business in the State of Texas and in furtherance thereof, has erected and maintained certain items of its physical plant in the City of South Houston, Texas (hereinafter referred to as the "city") for many years pursuant to such rights as have been granted it by and under the laws of the State of Texas, and subject to the reasonable exercise of the police powers granted by and under said laws to the city; and 
WHEREAS, the telephone company has operated its telecommunications business in the city under successive ordinances of the city, the last of which was the ordinance adopted August 4, 1942, which provided compensation to the city for the superintendence of that agreement based upon a percentage of gross receipts received by the telephone company from certain local services rendered within the corporate limits of the city; and 
WHEREAS, it is recognized by the parties that changes in the telecommunications industry, changes in technology, changes in state and federal law, and changes in the accounting practices mandated by the Uniform System of Accounts promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), along with regulatory requirements of the Texas Public Utility Commission ("PUC"), have caused the traditional method of determining the amount of compensation to municipalities to become administratively impractical for telecommunications utilities. In order to resolve these issues in a manner satisfactory to both the city and the telephone company, the city and the telephone company have chosen the method of determining the amount of compensation provided for in this Ordinance to eliminate the expenses and time related to audits, to achieve administrative simplicity, to provide the city with predictable revenues and an opportunity for growth and to avoid the expense and delays of litigation which could be necessary to resolve any issues in controversy between the parties; and 
WHEREAS, it is to the mutual advantage of both the city and the telephone company that an agreement should be entered into between the telephone company and the city establishing the conditions under which the telephone company shall maintain and construct its physical plant in the city in the future; 
Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Board of Aldermen of the City of South Houston, Texas, that:

The terms of this ordinance shall apply throughout the city, and to all operations and facilities used in whole or in part in the provision of telecommunications services in newly annexed areas upon the effective date of any annexation.  
Section 2. - Additional authority required. 
The telephone company is not authorized to provide cable television service as a cable operator in the city under this Ordinance, but must obtain a franchise from the city for that purpose, under such terms and conditions as may be required by law.

Whenever used in this Ordinance, the following words and terms shall have the definitions and meanings provided in this Section: 
(a)  Facilities: All telephone company duct spaces, manholes, poles, conduits, underground and overhead passageways, and other equipment, structures and appurtenances and all associated transmission media.

Section 4. - Term. 
This ordinance shall be in force and effect from July 1, 1995, through June 30, 1996, provided that at the expiration of this initial period, such term shall be automatically extended for successive periods of one (1) year, unless written notice of intent to terminate this agreement is given by either party not less than ninety (90) days prior to the termination of the then current period. When such notice is given this agreement shall terminate at the expiration of the then current period. 
(Ord. No. 95-006, § 1, 6-20-95)  
Section 5. - Supervision by city of location of poles and conduits. 
All poles placed shall be of sound material and reasonably straight, and shall be set so that they will not interfere with the flow of water in any gutter or drain, and so that the same will not unduly interfere with ordinary travel on the streets or sidewalks. The location and route of all poles, stubs, guys, anchors, conduits, fiber and cables placed and constructed by the telephone company in the construction and maintenance of its telecommunications system in the city shall be subject to the lawful, reasonable and proper control and direction of the city.  
Section 6. - Attachments to poles and space in ducts. 
Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be construed to require or permit any pole attachments for electric light or power wires or communications facilities or systems not provided by the telephone company to be attached to the telephone company's poles or other physical plant or placed in the telephone company's conduit. 
If the city desires pole attachments for electric light or power wires or communication facilities or systems not provided by the telephone company, or if the city desires to place communications facilities or systems not provided by the telephone company in any telephone company duct, then a further separate, noncontingent agreement shall be prerequisite to such attachment(s) or such use of any duct by the city. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall obligate or restrict the telephone company in exercising its rights voluntarily to enter into pole attachment, pole usage, joint ownership or other wire space or facilities agreements with light and/or power companies or with other wire-using companies which are authorized to operate within the city.  
Section 7. - Streets to be restored to preexisting condition. 
The surface of any public street, avenue, highway, alley or public place disturbed by the telephone company in the construction or maintenance of its telecommunications system shall be restored within a reasonable time after the completion of the work to as good a condition as before the commencement of the work. Should the city reasonably determine, within one year from the date of such restoration, that such surface requires additional restoration work to place it in as good a condition as before the commencement of the work, the telephone company shall perform such additional restoration work to the reasonable satisfaction of the city. No public street, avenue, highway, alley or public place shall be encumbered for a longer period than shall be reasonably necessary to execute all work.

The expense of such temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting them, and the telephone company may require payment in advance. The telephone company shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary rearrangements.  
Section 9. - Tree trimming. 
The right, license, privilege and permission is hereby granted to the telephone company, its contractors and agents, to trim trees upon and overhanging the streets, avenues, highways, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the aerial wires, fiber or cables of the telephone company, and when so directed by the city, said trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction of the city or of any city official to whom said duties have been or may be delegated.  
Section 10. - Indemnity. 
The telephone company shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from all costs, expenses (including attorney's fees) and damages to persons or property arising directly or indirectly out of the construction, maintenance or operation of the telephone company's facilities located within the public rights-of-way found to be caused solely by the negligence of the telephone company. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the telephone company and the city.  
Section 11. - Administration of ordinance. 
(a)  The city may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to this Ordinance and the telephone company shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(b)  Copies of petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted by the telephone company to the Federal Communications Commission or the Public Utility Commission of Texas shall be provided to the city upon request. 
(c)  The city may establish, after reasonable notice, such rules and regulations as may be appropriate for the administration of this Ordinance and the construction of the telephone company's facilities on city property to the extent permitted by law.  
Section 12. - Compensation to the city. 
(a)  As compensation for the use, occupancy, oversight, supervision and regulation of the city's rights-of-way, and in lieu of and in full compensation for any lawful tax or license or charge or right-of-way permit fee or inspection fee, whether charged to the telephone company or its contractor(s), or any right-of-way easement or street or alley rental or franchise tax or other character of charge for use and occupancy of the rights-of-way within the city, except the usual general ad valorem taxes, special assessments in accordance with state law or sales taxes now or hereafter levied by the city in accordance with state law, the city hereby imposes a charge upon the gross receipts (as hereinafter defined) of the telephone company. The amount of the charge for the first year this ordinance is in effect shall be fifty-one thousand dollars ($51, 000.00). In no event shall such charge be less than the above amount for each year this Ordinance is in effect, except as provided in the case of disannexation as set forth in paragraph 12(e), or as provided in Section 16 herein. 
The telephone company will, according to tariff, bill such charge to the customer service charges included within the term "gross receipts," as defined herein. Gross receipts, for purposes of this charge, shall include only customer service charges which meet all four of the following conditions: (1) such charges are for telephone company services provided within the city; (2) such charges are billed through the telephone company's Customer Records Information System ("CRIS"); (3) such charges are the recurring charges for the local exchange access rate element specified in the telephone company's tariffs filed with the PUC; and (4) such charges are subject to an interstate end user common line ("EUCL") charge as imposed by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"). For the second and subsequent years while this Ordinance remains in effect, the above charge is subject to adjustment by application of the growth factor set out in paragraph 12(c). This adjustment for the growth factor will be made effective as of each anniversary date of this Ordinance. 
The telephone company shall adjust its billings to customers to account for any undercollection or overcollection of the charge due the city. 
(b)  The charge for each year shall be paid in four (4) equal payments. The dates shall be February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, with the first payment under this Ordinance due on November 30, 1992. In the event of any over or undercollection from customers at the expiration of this Ordinance, the telephone company may make a pro rata one-time credit or charge to the customer billing for affected customers who are billed for a service included within gross receipts, as defined in paragraph 12(a). This will be accomplished within one hundred fifty (150) days following the date of expiration of this Ordinance. If however, it is impractical to credit any overcollection to customers, then such overcollection shall be paid to the city. 
(c)  The growth factor shall be calculated by dividing the telephone company's revenues within the corporate limits of the city subject to the state telecommunications sales tax ("sales tax revenues") applicable to services rendered within the corporate limits of the city for the twelve-month period ending three (3) months prior to the next anniversary date of this Ordinance by the sales tax revenues for the twelve-month period ending three (3) months prior to either the initial effective date or the preceding anniversary date of this Ordinance as applicable. The growth factor calculated by the method set forth in the preceding sentence, if greater than one, shall be multiplied by the current year's charge to determine the dollar amount of the charge for the next year. If the growth factor calculated above is one or less, the charge for the next year shall be equal to the current year's charge. The telephone company will adjust its customer billing to account for the growth factor calculated above. 
Once the growth factor calculation is completed, the telephone company will provide the city with the sales tax revenues upon which the growth factor calculation was based. 
The city agrees to rely upon audits by the Texas Comptroller of public accounts of state telecommunications sales taxes as reported by the telephone company which are performed in compliance with Sections 151.023 and 151.027 of the Texas Tax Code Annotated (Vernon's 1982). 
The growth factor shall be recomputed to reflect any final, nonappealable adjustments made pursuant to an audit finding by the Texas Comptroller of an inaccuracy in the telephone company's reports of revenues subject to state telecommunications sales taxes. The charge shall be recalculated using the growth factor recomputed as specified in the preceding sentence, and the recalculated charge shall be used for all future calculations required by this Ordinance, any overpayment or underpayment resulting from such recalculation shall be subtracted from or added to the first installment due the following year. If any overpayment or underpayment shall be due during the final year of this Ordinance, then payment shall be made as follows. In the case of overpayment by the telephone company, the city shall pay such overpayment to the telephone company within one hundred fifty (150) days following the expiration of this Ordinance and, in the case of underpayment by the telephone company, the telephone company shall pay such underpayment to the city within one hundred fifty (150) days following the expiration of this Ordinance. 
(d)  Such payments shall not relieve the telephone company from paying all applicable municipally-owned utility service charges. Should the city not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing charge shall be in lieu of the taxes, licenses, charges, rights-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes aforesaid, then the city agrees that it will apply so much of such payments as may be necessary to the satisfaction of the telephone company's obligation, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, rights-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes. 
(e)  In the event that either (1) territory within the boundaries of the city shall be disannexed and a new incorporated municipality created which includes such territory or (2) an entire, existing incorporated municipality shall be consolidated or annexed into the city, then notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, the charge shall be adjusted. To accomplish this adjustment, within thirty days following the action effecting a disannexation/annexation as described above, the city shall provide the telephone company with maps of the affected area(s) showing the new boundaries of the city. 
In the event of an annexation as described above, the charge for the city will be adjusted to include the amount of the payment by the telephone company to the existing incorporated municipality being annexed. In the event that the annexed municipality had no ordinance imposing a charge or in the event of a disannexation, then the adjustment to the charge will be calculated using the effective date of the imposition of local sales taxes as determined by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The adjustment shall be the percent increase/decrease in the telephone company's gross receipts as defined herein for the city for the first calendar month following the local sales tax effective date compared to the last month prior to such effective date. This adjustment to the charge will be made on the first day of the second month following the local sales tax effective date and the adjusted charge shall be prorated from that date through the remainder of the payment year. The charge as adjusted shall be used for all future calculations required by this Ordinance.  
Section 13. - Assignment of ordinance. 
This Ordinance and any rights or privileges hereunder shall not be assignable to any other entity without the express consent of the city. Such consent shall be evidenced by an ordinance which shall fully recite the terms and conditions, if any, upon which such consent is given.  
Section 14. - Mutual release. 
The city hereby fully releases, discharges, settles and compromises any and all claims which the city has made or could have made arising out of or connected with the Ordinance adopted August 14, 1942, and renewed or extended from time to time thereafter, and its predecessor ordinances, if any, (hereinafter referred to collectively as "1942 Ordinance"). This full and complete release of claims for any matters under the 1942 Ordinance shall be for the benefit of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company; its parent; its affiliates; their directors, officers and employees; successors and assigns; and included any and all claims, actions, causes of action and controversies, presently known or unknown, arising directly or indirectly out of or connected with the telephone company's obligations to the city pursuant to the provisions of the 1942 Ordinance. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, its parent, its affiliates, successors and assigns hereby fully release, discharge, settle and compromise any and all claims, actions causes of action or controversies heretofore made or which could have made, known or unknown, against the city, its officers or its employees, arising out of or connected with any matters under 1942 Ordinance. 
It is the intent of the city and the telephone company to enter into the foregoing mutual releases in order to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both the city and the telephone company. This ordinance and the mutual releases set forth in this Section represents a compromise of each party's claims as well as each party's defenses, and is not intended to be and is not admission of liability or vulnerability by either party to the other with respect to either the claims or the defense asserted against the other.  
Section 15. - Repeal of conflicting ordinances and agreements. 
The Ordinance adopted August 4, 1942, is hereby repealed; provided, however, such repeal shall take effect at 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the effective date specified in the Section of this Ordinance entitled "acceptance of agreement and effective date". All other ordinances and agreements and parts of ordinances and agreements in conflict herewith are also repealed, which repeal shall take effect at the time and on the date specified in the preceding sentence.  
Section 16. - Future contingency. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance to the contrary, in the event that (a) this Ordinance or any part hereof, (b) any tariff provision by which the telephone company seeks to collect the charge imposed by this Ordinance, or (c) any procedure provided in this Ordinance, or (d) any competition due the city under this Ordinance, becomes, or is declared or determined by a judicial, administrative or legislative authority exercising its jurisdiction to be excessive, unrecoverable, unenforceable, void, unlawful or otherwise inapplicable, in whole or in part, the telephone company and city shall meet and negotiate a new ordinance passage. The telephone company shall have thirty (30) days from and after the final passage of this Ordinance to file its written acceptance of this Ordinance with the city secretary. This Ordinance shall become effective beginning the first day of the quarter not less than thirty (30) days after its final passage by the city.

In consideration for the rights and privileges herein granted, the Company agrees to pay to the City, beginning on the Effective Date and continuing throughout the remaining term of the Prior Franchise and the additional thirty (30) year term of this Franchise provided for in Section 4, above, an annual franchise fee (referred to herein as "Annual Franchise Fee"), subject to an Annual Adjustment Factor as set forth below. Except as set forth in Section 15, payment of the Annual Franchise Fee shall be the total compensation payable to the City in consideration for the right, privilege and franchise herein conferred for the Company's use of the Public Rights-of-Way to construct, operate, use and maintain its System for the provision of electric transmission and distribution service and its right to use, license, or exploit its System for Other Services. 
The Annual Franchise Fee shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  The "Annual Franchise Fee," for the twelve-month period beginning on the Effective Date (the "Initial Franchise Year"), shall be $440,774.36. 
2.  The Annual Franchise Fee for each succeeding twelve-month period (each a "Franchise Year"), including the Franchise Year beginning July 1, 2007, shall be adjusted by multiplying $440,774.36 by the Annual Adjustment Factor. The "Annual Adjustment Factor" for any given year shall be a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the kWh delivered by the Company within the Franchise Area (inclusive of street lighting) in the previous calendar year and the denominator of which shall be the kWh delivered by the Company within the Franchise Area (inclusive of street lighting) in 2005, said amount being 135,063,649 kWh. (Example: The Annual Franchise Fee for the Franchise Year beginning July 1, 2010 $440,774.36)x 2009 kWh 135,063,649 kWh). 
In no case, however, shall the Annual Franchise Fee be less than the Annual Franchise Fee established in (1), above, for the Initial Franchise Year. 
In calculating the amount to be paid each year, the Company shall offset its Annual Franchise Fee payments with the amount of the Municipal Account Franchise Credits and Municipal Franchise Fee Credits provided in the Company's tariffs and applicable to the City in the prior calendar year. The annual Franchise fee shall be payable in equal monthly installments due the first day of each calendar month. The Company shall calculate the new franchise fee to be payable for each Franchise Year beginning July 1 st and shall provide the same along with the basis for such calculation to the City for its review no later than April 1 st of each year. If the Company does not receive an objection from the City by May 31 st , the Company shall implement the adjusted Annual Franchise Fee payment on July 1 st . If the additional thirty (30) year term of this Franchise provided for in Section 4, above, ends on any day other than the last day of the last Franchise Year, then the Annual Franchise Fee for the final Franchise Year shall first be calculated pursuant to this Section 11 and then pro-rated accordingly.  
Section 12. - [Franchise payments.] 
The parties agree that the franchise payments due under this Franchise are reasonable and necessary and that the parties shall use their best efforts to enable the Company to recover these payments through its electric rates.  
Section 13. - [No additional charges.] 
Except as provided in Section 15, the Annual Franchise Fee payable hereunder shall be the total compensation payable by the Company to the City for the Company's use of the Public Rights-of-Way for the conduct of its business under the Franchise. The City shall not charge any additional license, charge, fee, street or alley rental, or OTHER character of charge or levy for the use or occupancy of the Public Rights-of-Way in the City, or any pole tax or inspection fee tax. If the City does charge the Company any additional license, charge, fee, street or alley rental, or other character of charge or levy, then the Company may deduct the amount charged from the next succeeding franchise payment or payments until fully reimbursed. The Franchise shall constitute a permit to perform all work on the Company's System within the Public Rights-of-Way and to park vehicles in the Streets and other Public Rights-of-Way when necessary for the installation, removal, operation or maintenance of the Company's System. The Company and contractors performing work for the Company shall not be required to obtain any permits in addition to the Franchise or to pay any fee in addition to the Annual Franchise Fee in order to perform work on the Company's System or to park within the Streets and other Public Rights-of-Way. The Company shall cooperate with the City to avoid unnecessary disruption, and the Company shall comply with all valid City ordinances governing time periods and standards relating to excavating in the Public Rights-of-Way.  
Section 14. - [Base rates.] 
In the first rate case to review the Company's base rates following the Effective Date (the "First Rate Case"), the City shall support the Company's request to include in the Company's base rates the entire then-effective Annual Franchise Fee. If, as a result of the First Rate Case, or any subsequent rate case, the Company's entire then-effective Annual Franchise Fee is not included in the Company's base rates, then the Company shall be required to pay only so much in franchise fees as the amount of franchise fees used by the PUC to calculate the Company's then-effective rates.  
Section 15. - [Conductor space.] 
In addition to the considerations set forth in Section 11, the Company shall furnish, free of charge, subject to the use of the City, such pole and/or duct space as may be required from time to time for the installation of the City-owned traffic, police and fire alarm system conductors; provided such conductor space does not exceed the available capacity on any one existing pole or in one existing interior duct. The Company shall allow for the expanded use of existing energized conductors by the City for the purposes of providing traffic signal communication interconnectivity with prior written approval from the Company. The specific location for these traffic, police and fire alarm conductors on the Company poles or ducts shall be determined by the Company and shall be allotted at the time specific applications for space are received from the City. All City traffic, police and fire alarm circuits on the Company poles and ducts shall be designed and installed, operated and maintained in compliance with the applicable provisions of the NESC and other laws, statutes, codes and ordinances applicable to private parties and so as to create no interference, corrosion, harm, damage or hazard with, to or from the Company's System or the Company's business. All plans for such city traffic, police and fire alarm circuits must be submitted for the Company's written approval prior to installation. Any modifications to the Company's System necessary to accommodate such installation shall be paid by the City. If, after installation, the City's equipment is found to interfere with the Company's System or business, the Company and the City shall work together to address the problem and, if deemed practical by the Company, preserve the City's access. Where main underground duct lines are located between manholes, the Company shall permit free of charge the installation in one interior duct by the City of its traffic, police or fire alarm signal cables; provided space is available in an interior duct not suitable for power circuits without interference with the Company's system neutral conductors. All cables installed by the City in the Company ducts shall be of the non-metallic sheath type to prevent corrosive or electrolytic action between the City- and the Company-owned cables. A request for duct assignment shall in each instance be submitted to the Company and a sketch showing duct allocation shall be received from the Company prior to the installation of the City cables in Company-owned duct lines. All City-owned conductors and cables, whether on poles or in duct lines, shall be constructed, maintained and operated in such manner as to not interfere with or create a hazard in the operation of the Company's System or the Company's business. If, after installation, the City's equipment is found to interfere with the Company's System or business, the Company and the City shall work together to address the problem and, if deemed practical by the Company, preserve the City's access. 
In addition to the consideration set forth in Section 11, the Company shall permit the City to use, free of charge, extra space on its street light poles to install City-owned traffic control signs and decorative banners, with prior written approval from the Company and provided that such use is consistent with the NESC and OTHER applicable engineering and operational codes and standards. 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Franchise, it is further agreed that the Company shall not be responsible to any party or parties whatsoever for any claims, demands, losses, suits, judgments for damages or injuries to Persons or property by reason of the construction, maintenance, inspection or use of the traffic signal light systems, police and fire alarm systems, traffic control signs, or decorative banners belonging to the City and constructed upon the Company's poles or street light poles or in its ducts, and the City shall indemnify and hold the Company harmless against all such claims, losses, demands, suits and judgments, to the extent permitted by the Texas Tort Claims Act, but the City does not, by this agreement, admit primary liability to any third party by reason of the City's operation and use of such traffic signal light systems, police and fire alarm systems, traffic control signs, or decorative banners, such being a function of government.  
Section 16. - [Audit.]

The City shall bear the costs of any such audit or inquiry. All books and records related to the Company's operations under this Franchise shall be available to the City. Upon receipt of a written request from the City, such documents shall be made available for inspection and copying no later than thirty (30) days from the receipt of such request. Amounts due to the City for past underpayments or amounts due the Company for past overpayments shall include interest calculated using the annual interest rates for overcharges as set by the Texas Public Utility Commission. Said interest shall be payable on such sum from the date the initial payment was due until it is past.  
Section 17. - [Waive claims of prior franchise agreements.] 
The parties agree to waive any and all claims, asserted or unasserted, arising out of prior franchise agreements including, without limitation, the Prior Franchise, except those claims relating to the Company's obligations as determined in an audit underway as of March 1, 2006.  
Section 18. - [Exclusive rights of privileges.]

Should the Company fail or refuse to maintain its System in good order and furnish efficient service at all times throughout the life of this grant, except only when prevented from so doing by Force Majeure, or should Company fail or refuse to furnish efficient service at reasonable rates, lawfully determined by the City, throughout the life of this grant, excepting only during such periods as the Company shall in good faith diligently contest the reasonableness of the rates in question, then it shall forfeit and pay to the City the sum of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25) for each day it shall so fail or refuse after reasonable notice thereof and a hearing thereon by the City. Any suit to recover such penalty shall be filed within one year from the date the penalty accrues.  
Section 20. - [Invalid, illegal or incapable provisions.] 
If any term or other provision of the Franchise is determined by an unappealable decision by a court, administrative agency, or arbitrator to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of the Franchise shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party.
