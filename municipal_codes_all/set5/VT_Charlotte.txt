CHAPTER II. ZONING DISTRICTS 

Section 2.1 Zoning Districts & Zoning Map 
The following zoning districts are established for the Town of Charlotte, in accordance with the Act: 
West Charlotte Village  (WCV)  
East Charlotte Village  (ECV)  
Village Commercial  (VCM)  
Commercial/ Light Industrial  (C/LI)  
Rural  (RUR)  
Shoreland  (SHR)  
Shoreland Seasonal Home Management  (SHM)  
Conservation  (CON)  
Route 7 Scenic Overlay  (R7O)  
Flood Hazard Area Overlay  (FHO)  

The location and boundaries of these zoning districts are established as shown on the “Charlotte Zoning Map,” which is on file at the Town Offices and incorporated into these regulations and made part hereof. Flood Hazard Area Overlay District boundaries are shown in and on the most current flood insurance studies and depicted on the most recent National Flood Insurance Program maps for the Town of Charlotte, published by the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance Program, as provided by the Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources pursuant to 10 V.S.A. Chapter 32 §753. These maps are adopted by reference and incorporated as part of these regulations.  The official zoning map may only be altered by adoption or amendment in accordance with the Act [§§4441, 4442] and this bylaw (Section 1.5). 
Section 2.2 Interpretation of District Boundaries 
(A) 
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 

(1) 	
Boundaries indicated as following roads, highways, or utility rights-of-way shall be interpreted to follow the centerlines of such features. 

(2) 	
Boundaries indicated as following railroad tracks shall be interpreted to be midway between the main tracks, or the centerline of the right-of-way if no tracks are present. 

(3) 	
Boundaries indicated as following property boundaries or platted lot lines shall be interpreted to follow such property boundaries. 

(4) 	
Boundaries indicated as following rivers or streams shall be interpreted to follow the channel centerline of such features, and shall move with the channel. 

(5) 	
Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be interpreted as following the mean high water mark (which for Lake Champlain is 98 feet above mean sea level), and shall move with the shoreline. 

(6) 	
Boundaries indicated as elevation contour lines shall be interpreted to follow a constant, specified elevation as measured from mean sea level or other accepted reference datum. 

(7) 	
Boundaries indicated as parallel or perpendicular to, or extensions of, the above features shall be interpreted as such on the ground.  

(8) 	
Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map or otherwise described in these regulations shall be determined by the scale of the map. 

(B) 
The abandonment or relocation of a right-of-way or other feature that references a district boundary line after the effective date of these regulations, shall not effect the location of the district boundary line except as specified above for rivers, streams and shorelines. 

(C) 
Within the Flood Hazard Area Overlay District, where available (i.e., in Zones A1-A30, AE and AH), base flood elevations and floodway limits provided by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in the most recent Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Charlotte and accompanying maps shall be used to administer and enforce the flood hazard area overlay district provisions of these regulations.  In Special Flood Hazard Areas where base flood elevations and floodway limits have not been provided by the NFIP in the Flood Insurance Study and accompanying maps (i.e., Zone A), it is the applicant’s responsibility to develop the necessary base flood elevation and floodway information.  Where available, the applicant shall use data obtained from FEMA, state or federal agencies or other sources. Should the flood hazard areas and regulations be subsequently amended by state or federal law, agency or regulations, those revised flood hazard areas and regulations shall be automatically incorporated herein by reference. 

(D) 
When the Zoning Administrator cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary, the Planning Commission and/or appropriate state or federal official may be consulted prior to issuing a determination.  A determination by the Zoning Administrator regarding the location of a district boundary may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment under Section 9.6. 

If uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard Area or the floodway, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator (ZA).  If the applicant disagrees with the determination made by the ZA, a Letter of Map Amendment from FEMA shall constitute proof. 

(E) 
Where a lot is divided by a town boundary, the standards of these regulations shall be applied to that portion of the lot located in the Town of Charlotte in the same manner as if the entire lot was located in the town.

Section 2.3 Application of District Standards 
(A) 
Tables 2.1 through 2.11 set forth the stated purpose, allowed uses, and specific standards for each zoning district. Listed uses must meet all applicable district standards. 

(B) 
Uses for each district are classified as either a “permitted use” to be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator prior to the issuance of a zoning permit under Section 9.3, or as a “conditional use” to be reviewed by the Board 


of Adjustment in accordance with Section 5.4.  Both permitted and conditional uses must meet applicable district standards, and also general standards found in Chapter III and specific standards found in Chapter IV.  
(C) In the event that a proposed use is not set forth as either a permitted or conditional uses, the Board of Adjustment may allow it as conditional use after a public hearing as provided in Section 5.4 if the Board of Adjustment finds that the proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the district (as stated in this chapter), is of the same general character as one or more permitted or conditional uses allowed within the district, and that such use will not be detrimental to adjoining land uses.

System Sewer Ordinance. 
(8) 	
The alteration, expansion or repair of any structure shall not reduce the structure’s existing setback distance from the shoreline (mean high water mark) as of the effective date of these regulations, nor increase the height of the structure so that it exceeds two (2) stories or 30 feet, whichever is less.  

(9) 	
Demolition and alterations, expansions or repairs that change the appearance, height, footprint or historic character of an existing structure are subject to conditional use under Section 5.4, design review under Subsection (G), and the requirements of Section 3.1. Historic structures damaged beyond repair may be replaced within the same footprint, subject to conditional use review under Sections 5.4, and design review under Subsection (G). 

(10) 
Temporary docks which are wooden or metal, used only for noncommercial purposes, are mounted on piles or floats, and removed at the end of each season do not require a zoning permit if the total (combined) length of all docks under single ownership does not exceed 50 feet (from Mean High Water), and the total (combined) area of all docks, including deck areas, does not exceed 500 square feet. No concrete, masonry, earth or rock fill, sheet piling, bulkheading, cribwork, or similar construction may form any part of the dock. Other types of docks shall be considered shoreline improvements. 

(11) 
Shoreline improvements are exempted from shoreline setback requirements, but shall be sited and designed to avoid wetlands, designated wildlife habitat, and other sensitive shoreline features; shall minimize surface runoff, channeling and soil erosion; and shall avoid adverse impacts and obstructions to adjoining shoreland areas. 

(G) 
District Design Review Standards. Before granting conditional use approval for any alteration, expansion, demolition, or removal of any portion of any principal structure in this district, the Board of Adjustment shall seek the recommendations of the Design Review Committee, based on information found in the Historic Sites and Structures Survey for the Town of Charlotte, prepared by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, and the report titled “A Natural and Cultural Resource Inventory and Planning Recommendations for Thompson’s Point, Charlotte, Vermont” (September 1990, as may be amended). Copies of both reports are available for review at the Planning and Zoning Office. In addition, the Committee’s recommendation to the Board shall include its findings with regard to the following design review criteria: 

(1) 	
The size, scale, style, design and materials of any structural alteration, expansion or replacement are consistent and harmonious with existing structures, and with the overall historic and aesthetic character of the area. 

(2) 	
Natural features should be identified. 

(3) 	
Alterations or additions to an historic structure shall preserve the historic appearance of the structure and 


not alter the structure’s historic integrity. 
(4)

(A) 
Purpose. The purpose of the Route 7 Scenic Overlay District is to protect scenic resources within a designated area along the Route 7 corridor which are identified in the Charlotte Town Plan as special features. The scenic resources of this section of the corridor are significant because of the high level of public and private investment in conservation in this area, the openness of both easterly and westerly views to mountains, lake and fields, the importance of Route 7 as a major transportation artery and the additional importance of agricultural and historic resources in this area.

(H) 	Warning and Disclaimer: 
District designation does not imply that lands outside of designated flood hazard areas, or land uses permitted within designated flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages.  District designation and the administration of associated standards shall not create liability on the part of the municipality, or any official or employee thereof, for any damages that result from the application of this bylaw or any decision lawfully made thereunder. 
CHAPTER III. GENERAL REGULATIONS 

Section 3.1 Repair of Damaged Structures; Demolition 
(A) 
Damaged Structures.  No zoning permit shall be required for the stabilization, repair, restoration, or reconstruction of a damaged structure to the extent of its prior condition and use. Unless other timelines are approved by the Board of Adjustment, stabilization of a damaged structure shall occur in a reasonable amount of time following the event resulting in damage, in order to prevent hazards to public health and safety and adjoining properties.  [Also see Section 3.8] 

(B) 
Demolition.  Immediately following demolition, all materials shall be disposed of according to solid waste district standards, the site shall be restored to a normal grade, and ground cover shall be established sufficient to prevent erosion. 



Section 3.2 Road, Driveway and Pedestrian Access Requirements 
(A) 
Access Requirement. Pursuant to the Act [§4412(3)], land development may be permitted on lots which have either frontage on a maintained state or Class I, II or III public road or public waters, in accordance with district frontage requirements, or with the approval of the Planning Commission, access to such a road or waters by means of a Class IV road, legal trail and/or a permanent easement or right-of­way at least 50 feet wide, all in accordance with the standards of this section. 

(1) 	
Substandard Access. Use of a substandard right-of-way or easement (i.e., less than 50 feet in width) for the purpose of creating an access to proposed land development is only allowed subject to Planning Commission approval and in accordance with the following: 

(a) 	
Use of a substandard access shall be limited to lots without required frontage which were legally in existence as of the effective date of these regulations. 

(b) 	
Development on a pre-existing, non-frontage lot with a substandard access shall be limited to one (1) dwelling unit or principal use. 



(2) 	
Review Process. Consideration of a request for a right-of-way (road or driveway) will be undertaken within the subdivision review or site plan review process.  If no subdivision or site plan review is required, the Commission shall review the request in accordance with Section 9.9 using standards within Section 3.2, subsections (C) and (D). 

(B) 
Highway Access Permit. Access onto town highways is subject to the approval of the Charlotte Selectboard , or for U.S. 7 (Ethan Allen Highway), the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans), in accordance with state statutes and the Town of Charlotte’s “Policy and Procedure for Highway Access Permits” as most recently amended.  Highway access permits must be issued prior to the issuance of a 

zoning permit.  

(C) 
Access Management Standards. The following access management standards shall apply to all land uses and development within the town under the jurisdiction of these Charlotte Land Use Regulations::. 

(1) 	
No lot may be served by more than one (1) access (curb cut), except for: 

(a) 	
a lot for which it is determined, subject to subdivision, site plan, or conditional use review, that one or more additional accesses are necessary to ensure vehicular and pedestrian safety; or 

(b) 	
instances in which strict compliance with this standard, due to the presence of one or more physical constraints (e.g., streams, wetlands, steep slopes) would result in adverse 




environmental impacts or a less desirable site design and layout than would be otherwise possible. 
(2) 	
For a parcel having frontage on two (2) roads (i.e., a corner or through lot), the access shall be located on the less traveled road, unless otherwise approved by the Commission or Board due to particular site, safety or road conditions. 

(3) 	
If property has frontage on Route 7 the following shall also apply: 

(a) 	
For purposes of access management, a “property” or parcel that borders Route 7 shall include one or more contiguous parcels under common ownership, any of which have a property line conterminous with the Route 7 right-of-way line. If any of the contiguous parcels under common ownership also have frontage on a secondary road that intersects Route 7, the entire property shall be considered to have access to both Route 7 and to the secondary road.  

(b) 	
A property having frontage on Route 7 and no frontage on a secondary road shall be allowed a maximum of one (1) access point onto Route 7.   Where feasible, said access point shall be located and designed so as to provide access to the entire property, and shall meet all applicable standards of these regulations.  No access shall be permitted where traffic conditions, topography, or any physical site limitation would prevent the construction of a safe access. 

(c) 	
A property having frontage on Route 7 and on a secondary road shall be required to locate all access points on the secondary road, except where the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment determines that the topographical or traffic safety conditions make such location impracticable.  Such access points shall be located and designed to provide access to the entire property, and shall meet all applicable standards of these regulations. 



(4) 	
New driveways and roads should be located to achieve appropriate sight distances, at least 125 feet (on center) from the intersection with a private road, and at least 225 feet (on center) from an intersection with a public road. 

(5) 	
The width of a proposed driveway, road or parking area shall not exceed the applicable state standard (B-71, A-76 as most recently amended) for the proposed use. 

(6) 	
Shared access is encouraged, and may be required for development subject to subdivision, site plan or conditional use review.  During subdivision review, site plan review, or conditional use review an access may be eliminated, combined, or relocated to meet the requirements of these regulations. 

(7) 	
A new access in the Town of Charlotte intended to serve a use or development in another town that is not an allowed use in the zoning district in which the proposed access is located is prohibited.  All other proposed accesses serving another town shall be considered a conditional use subject to conditional use review by the Board of Adjustment under Section 5.4 and site plan review by the Planning Commission under Section 5.5, and other reviews as applicable.  In addition to meeting the requirements of Section 5.4 and Section 5.5, such access may be approved only: 

(a) 	
if no access to the proposed development is possible in the town in which the development is located;  and 

(b) 	
the access meets all applicable requirements of these regulations. 



(D) 
Roads and Driveways.  Driveways, which may serve up to two (2) lots, and private roads, which serve three (3) or more lots, must be designed and constructed to meet the standards as set forth in the 


Town of Charlotte’s  “Road and Driveway Standards” as most recently amended. 
(1) 	
Acceptance. Acceptance of private roads by the municipality is subject to the approval of the Charlotte Selectboard, pursuant to state law for the laying out of public rights-of-way.  Construction of a road to town standards in no way ensures such acceptance. 

(2) 	
Design. All roads, driveways and intersections shall be designed and constructed in accordance with 


the Town of Charlotte “Road and Driveway Standards” as most recently amended, and the 
following: 
(a) 	
In evaluating use of an access, the Planning Commission may consider the intended use of the property, safety, traffic, road and site conditions in granting, conditioning or denying access approval.  Conditions imposed by the Commission may include, but are not limited to, agreements that the town shall not be required to provide school busing beyond the public right-of-way, and that the owner of the property shall have the responsibility to upgrade and maintain the right-of-way for access by emergency vehicles. 

(b) 	
Roads and driveways should logically relate to topography to minimize site disturbance, including the amount of cut and fill required, and to produce usable lots, reasonable grades and safe intersections in relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such roads.  

(c) 	
Roads and driveways should be located to avoid fragmentation of and/or adverse impacts to areas of high public value listed in Table 7.1.  Additionally, to the extent feasible, roads should follow existing linear features such as utility corridors, tree lines, hedgerows and fence lines.  

(d) 	
Techniques for the preservation of scenic views and cultural features should be employed for the construction and maintenance of roads, including but not limited to the selection of visually compatible materials, the preservation of existing features, and appropriate management of vegetation within the road corridor. The use of surfacing material that minimizes driveway visibility and enhances surface permeability is encouraged, and may be required by the Commission or Board for development subject to subdivision, site plan, or conditional use review. A crushed stone or gravel surface is recommended.  

(e) 	
Roads and driveways should be designed to enhance the connectivity of the road network, particularly within village areas. 

(f) 	
The arrangement of lots and road rights-of-way in a proposed subdivision should allow for the future extension of roads to serve adjoining parcels and allow for efficient traffic circulation, access management, and emergency vehicle access.  Proposed road easements shall be shown on the plat, and may be required to extend to the subdivision and/or property boundary. 

(g) 	
Shared driveways are encouraged, and may be required for development subject to subdivision, site plan or conditional use review.  The owner of each lot upon which the common or shared driveway crosses shall provide a deeded easement to the benefited landowner which shall be recorded in the town land records. 

(h) 	
Driveways constructed in the Flood Hazard Area District must also meet applicable 
requirements for that district (see: Table 2.10 and Section 5.6). 



(3) 	Drainage. Stormwater management shall be provided to manage stormwater runoff from all proposed roads and/or parking areas in accordance with Section 7.8 of these regulations. 
Page 24 	Charlotte Land Use Regulations 
(4) 	
Maintenance. The maintenance of all roads not designated as a Class I, II or III Town Highways or a State Highway shall be the responsibility of the applicant and subsequent owners.  The applicant shall supply evidence and assurance that such roads will be adequately maintained either by the applicant, lot owners or an owners’ association via an acceptable legal mechanism.  For developments involving access by a Class IV Town Highways or a legal trail, a road/trail maintenance agreement approved by the Selectboard shall be required in association with final subdivision approval. 

(5) 	
Road Names & Signs.  Road names proposed by the applicant shall be approved by the Charlotte 


Selectboard in accordance with the Town of Charlotte’s Road Naming & Numbering Ordinance 
currently in effect. Roads shall be identified by signs approved by the Selectboard. 
(6) 	
Modification of Road & Driveway Standards. In the case of unusual topographic conditions or other circumstances which would make strict adherence to these standards a substantial hardship, or result in a safety hazard, the Planning Commission may modify the application of one or more standards under this section, providing that the applicant demonstrates that the proposed road or driveway is accessible to emergency vehicles, does not pose a threat to motorists or pedestrians, will not result in unreasonable maintenance requirements for property owners, and is designed in a manner that is consistent with other applicable standards of these regulations. 

(E) 
Parking Areas & Transit Stops. Common or shared parking areas shall be designed in accordance with Section 3.12, and indicated on the site plan and the subdivision plat if applicable. In addition: 

(1) 	
The Commission may require common or shared parking areas to serve multiple lots or uses in order to allow for reduced lot sizes and/or higher densities of development, to reduce access points onto public roads, and/or to reduce the total amount of impervious surface within a development.  

(2) 	
For major subdivisions that will be served by school buses or other public transit services, the Commission also may require pull-offs and/or turn-arounds, and/or the provision of one or more sheltered bus stops for use by residents of the subdivision. 

(F) 
Trails. Trails or walkways should be provided as needed to facilitate pedestrian access and circulation within the subdivision, or to connect to adjoining roads, recreation and pedestrian paths, or sidewalks serving the subdivision.  Accordingly:

Section 3.6 Lot, Yard & Setback Requirements 
(A) 
Principal & Accessory Structures. Only one (1) principal use or structure shall be located on a single lot, unless otherwise allowed as an agricultural use under Section 4.2(B), or an adaptive reuse under Section 4.3, a mixed use under Section 4.12, or with the approval of the Planning Commission, as part of a planned residential or planned unit development under Chapter VIII. 

(1) 	
In the Rural District barns may be considered principal structures, and dwellings for farm owners, the farm operator, or farm workers may be considered accessory structures, if associated with an active agricultural operation, and in accordance with Section 4.2(B). 

(2) 	
An accessory structure or use must conform to all lot, setback, coverage and other dimensional requirements for the district in which it is located, unless specifically exempted from such requirements under Section 9.2. 

(B) 
Dimensional Standards. The following requirements apply to lots within all zoning districts, with the exception of existing nonconforming lots in accordance with Section 3.7. 

(1) 	
No lot shall be so reduced in area that it cannot meet area, yard, setback, frontage, coverage and other dimensional requirements for the district in which it is located, except as approved by the Planning Commission for a planned residential or planned unit development under Chapter VIII.  

(2)

(3) 	
The area required for a use to meet the dimensional, density or open space provisions under these regulations shall not be used to also meet the dimensional, density or open space requirements for another use, except as allowed for a mixed use. 

(4) 	
Frontage requirements for lots served by private roads (rights-of-way serving three or more lots) shall be the same as frontage requirements for lots served by public roads, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission, such as for lots located at the road terminus and for planned residential or planned unit developments under Chapter VIII.  

(5) 	
Only continuous, uninterrupted frontage along a road right-of-way shall be used to meet district frontage requirements. 

(6) 	
Side setback requirements shall apply to all lot boundaries for any lot which does not have frontage on a public or private road or public waters. 

(7) 	
All portions of a parcel that adjoin a public or private road shall be considered a front yard, and shall meet applicable front setback requirements. 

(C) 
Development Review. For development subject to site plan or conditional use review, the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment may require increased minimum setback distances, buffers, and landscaping and/or screening within designated setback areas, or limit the use of setback (yard) areas for parking and storage, to protect public health, safety, and welfare, and adjoining properties. 


Section 3.7 Nonconforming Lots (Existing Small Lots) 
In accordance with the Act [§4412(2)], any lot in individual and separate, nonaffiliated ownership from surrounding properties, lawfully in existence as of the effective date of these regulations, which does not meet the dimensional requirements of these regulations, may be developed for the purposes permitted in the district in which it is located if all other applicable requirements of these regulations are met; however, development is prohibited on existing small lots which either: 
(1) 	
are less than one-eighth (1/8th) acre in area; or 

(2) 	
have a width or depth dimension of less than 40 feet. 



Section 3.8 Nonconforming Uses of Land & Structures 
(A) 
Nonconforming Use.  Any use of land or use of a structure legally in existence as of the effective date of these regulations which does not comply with the requirements of these regulations, as adopted or as subsequently amended, shall be considered a nonconforming use.  A nonconforming use may be continued indefinitely in accordance with the Act [§4412(7)], subject to the following limitations.  A nonconforming use: 

(1) 	
may not be moved or altered except with the approval of the Board of Adjustment in association with conditional use review under Section 5.4; 

(2) 	
shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without approval under conditional use review under Section 5.4, and a determination by the Board of Adjustment that the proposed nonconforming use is of the same or a more restricted nature as the existing nonconforming use; 

(3) 	
shall not be re-established if such use has been changed to, or replaced by, a conforming use, or if such use has been discontinued for a period of six (6) months, regardless of the intent to resume the prior use; 

(4) 	
shall not be reestablished following abandonment or discontinuance resulting from structural damage from any cause, unless the nonconforming use is carried on uninterrupted in the undamaged part of the structure, or the use is reinstated within one (1) year of such damage. The Board of Adjustment may, on appeal, grant a one (1) year extension to reestablish the nonconforming use for situations it 


determines are beyond the applicant’s control. 
(B) 
Nonconforming Structures. Any structure, or portion thereof, legally in existence as of the effective date of these regulations which does not comply with the requirements of these regulations as adopted, or as subsequently amended, shall be considered a nonconforming structure.  A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied indefinitely in accordance with the Act [4412(7)], subject to the following limitations. A nonconforming structure: 

(1) 	
may undergo routine maintenance and repair, provided that such action does not increase the degree of noncompliance; 

(2) 	
may only be structurally modified or moved in a manner that will not increase the degree of noncompliance, unless approved by the Board of Adjustment in association with conditional use review under Section 5.4.  For purposes of these regulations, any structural alteration which extends the footprint, height or volume of a structure within any required setback or above the required maximum height (i.e., the amount of encroachment), shall be considered to increase the degree of noncompliance.  Any structural alteration of a nonconforming structure which extends the footprint, height or volume of a structure outside of any required setback or below the required maximum height shall not be considered to increase the degree of noncompliance. 


Page 28 	Charlotte Land Use Regulations 
(3) 	
may be repaired, restored or reconstructed after damage from any cause provided that the repair or reconstruction does not increase the degree of noncompliance which existed prior to the damage, is commenced within one year of the date of the event that led to the damage, and is substantially completed within two (2) years of the damage or destruction, in accordance with Section 3.1.  The Board of Adjustment may, on appeal, grant a one (1)-year extension to this deadline upon a determination that the delay was unavoidable and that the owner had acted to substantially complete the repair, restoration or reconstruction within the initial one (1)-year period. Any non-conforming structure in the Flood Hazard Overlay Area District must meet the standards of Section 5.6 

(C) 
Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as allowing the continuation of a use or occupancy of a structure that has been declared by an appropriate governmental authority (e.g., Health Officer) to be unsafe or to pose a threat to public health or safety. 



Section 3.9 Outdoor Lighting 
(A) 
Purpose. The town’s rural character is enhanced by the ability to clearly view and enjoy a night sky that is free of light pollution.  While some outdoor lighting may be necessary for safety and security, inappropriate, poorly designed or improperly installed outdoor lighting can create unsafe conditions and nuisances for adjoining property owners, cause sky glow which obstructs views of the night sky, and result in unnecessary power consumption. 

(B) 
General Standards. To allow for appropriate outdoor lighting, while minimizing its undesirable effects, the following standards apply to all outdoor lighting installations in the Town of Charlotte, with the exception of temporary holiday light displays which are exempted from these requirements: 

(1) 	
All outdoor lighting shall be kept to the minimum required for safety, security, and intended use, consistent with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located. 

(2) 	
Permanent outdoor lighting fixtures shall be designed to minimize glare, and shall not direct light upward or onto adjacent properties, roads, or public waters, or result in excessive lighting levels that are uncharacteristic of the surrounding neighborhood or area. 

(C) 
Specific Standards. For outdoor lighting installations associated with development that is subject to subdivision or site plan, the Planning Commission may also require the following, and condition approval accordingly: 

(1) 	
Information regarding exterior lighting fixtures, including fixture type, mounting locations and heights, illumination levels and distribution, and color, to be submitted as part of the development review application under Section 5.3.  A lighting plan, prepared by a qualified lighting expert, may be required as appropriate for projects requiring outdoor parking area, street, or security lighting.  

(2) 	
The burial of electrical service to outdoor lighting fixtures. 

(3) 	
The use of security or street lighting only if unusual or hazardous conditions require it.  Security lighting, where deemed necessary by the Commission, shall be shielded and aimed so that only designated surfaces or areas are illuminated. 

(4) 	
Street lighting shall not be provided except where it is deemed necessary by the Commission for safety or security, such as at road intersections, or pedestrian crossings or walkways. 

(5) 	
Outdoor lighting fixtures associated with nonresidential uses, except for approved security lighting, shall be illuminated only during business hours, unless otherwise specifically approved by the Planning Commission. 

(D) 
Waiver. The Planning Commission may waive or modify the requirements of this Section if it finds that doing so will not: 

(1) 	
jeopardize the stated intent of these provisions under Subsection (A), or that 

(2) 	
such a modification or waiver is needed for public safety, or to meet an overriding public purpose, such as the illumination of a public building or monument. 


Section 3.10 Outdoor Storage 
The dumping or outdoor storage of trash, garbage, radioactive waste, hazardous or corrosive chemicals, automobile junk or any refuse is prohibited except in solid or hazardous waste management facilities approved in accordance with these regulations (see Section 4.15) and state law.  However, individual property owners are permitted to dispose of organic solid waste generated by the household as part of the normal operation of their property and in a manner not injurious or obnoxious to the neighborhood or the natural environment. 

Section 3.11 Parking, Loading & Service Area Requirements 
(A) 
Parking. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided, on the same lot as the associated use, or on adjacent lots under the same ownership or under permanent easement, as set forth below: 

(1) 	
A required parking space shall have a minimum width of nine (9) feet, a minimum length of 18 feet, unobstructed access and maneuvering room, and a gravel or paved surface sufficient for year-round use. 

(2) 	
A minimum number of parking spaces as determined by the proposed use shall be provided in accordance with the requirements listed in Table 3.1, unless otherwise waived under Subsection C. 

(3) 	
In addition to the requirements listed in Table 3.1, all public, commercial and industrial uses must provide adequate clearly marked accessible parking spaces in accordance with state and federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements, and at least one (1) bicycle rack for use by employees and/or the general public. 

Additional conditions may be required for development that requires conditional use review or site plan review, under Sections 5.4 and 5.5. 

(B) 
Loading & Service Areas. Where a proposed development will require the frequent or regular loading or unloading of goods, sufficient on-site loading areas shall be provided.  Service areas also may be required for emergency vehicles, waste disposal and collection, bus, taxi, or van service, and other purposes as necessitated by the proposed use.  

(C) 
Waivers. The Planning Commission, under subdivision or site plan review, may modify or waive on-site parking, loading and/or service area requirements based on the determination under one or more of the following provisions that, due to circumstances unique to the development, the strict application of these standards is unnecessary or inappropriate: 


Page 30 	Charlotte Land Use Regulations 
(1) 	
green areas are to be set aside and maintained as open space for future conversion to parking, loading and/or services areas in the event that the spaces initially permitted are subsequently deemed inadequate to meet demonstrated need; 

(2) 	
adequate shared parking, loading, and/or services areas for use by two (2) or more businesses exist on the same or contiguous lots, which are either under common ownership or a long-term lease agreement;

Steep Slopes. Development impacting an area of 200 square feet or greater which has a slope with an existing grade equal to or in excess of 15%  (prior to any site improvement, excavation or blasting), or which results in such slopes over such an area, if not being reviewed as a subdivision or Planned Residential or Unit Development under the provisions of Chapters 6, 7 and 8, shall be subject to conditional use review by the Board of Adjustment under Section 5.4 and the following provisions: 

(1) 	
The site development plan submitted under Section 5.2 shall include contour intervals of five (5) feet or less, slope profiles showing existing gradients and proposed cut and fill sections, and a stormwater management and erosion control plan, prepared by a professional licensed by the state, that covers all phases of development (site preparation, construction, post construction). 

(2) 	
Development shall be sited and constructed, and slopes stabilized in accordance with accepted engineering and best management practices for stormwater management and erosion control to: 

(a) 	
prevent runoff, erosion, slumps, and other down slope movements of material, and 

(b) 	
to minimize associated risks to surface and ground waters, public facilities and roads, and neighboring properties. 



(3) 	
Development, including road and utility corridors, on slopes equal to or in excess of 15% shall be sited and designed to minimize visual impacts from public vantage points.  The use of landscaping and natural screening materials is encouraged, and may be required to lessen the visual impact of such development. 

(B) 
Very Steep Slopes. Development is specifically prohibited on slopes equal to or in excess of 25%, with the exception of stairways to the shoreline within the Shoreland District and the Shoreland Seasonal Home Management District, which are subject to conditional use review under Section 5.4 



Section 3.15 Surface Waters & Wetlands 
(A) 
Setbacks from Streams. To prevent surface runoff and accelerated soil erosion, and to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, all structures and wastewater disposal systems (septic tanks, leach fields) and other impervious surfaces shall be set back a minimum of 100 feet from all named streams, and a minimum of 50 feet from all unnamed streams as depicted on the zoning map or as identified through field investigation, and as measured horizontally from the top of the nearest stream bank.  Where the standards of this section differ from other applicable standards under the Flood Hazard Hazard Area 

Overlay District, the more restrictive shall apply.  In addition, all structures and wastewater disposal systems shall be set back a minimum of 150 feet from the top of the nearest stream bank of the following: 

(1) 	
The tributary of the LaPlatte River which originates near the intersection of Bingham Brook Road and Spear Street Extension and flows generally north through a large wetland adjacent to the microwave tower east of the Spear Street Extension. 

(2) 	
The stream which originates in a wetland parallel to and west of Bean Road, flows into and out of a wetland near the intersection of Bean Road and Prindle Road, and then generally south to its intersection with Lewis Creek. 

(B) 
Encroachments.  The expansion or enlargement of any structure that is legally in existence prior to the effective date of these regulations within required stream setback areas shall be subject to review as a nonconforming structure under Section 3.8 and applicable overlay district requirements in addition to the standards set forth in this section. The expansion or enlargement of existing structures within designated flood hazard areas is also subject to flood hazard area review under Section 5.6. 

(C) 
Stream-bank Buffers. In order to protect water quality and riparian habitat, and to prevent surface runoff and accelerated soil erosion, an undisturbed, naturally vegetated buffer shall be maintained along streams and rivers.  The buffer will be a minimum of 25 feet in width and will be measured from the top of the streambank or from the regular high water mark in instances where no stream bank is discernable. 

(D) 
Modification of Stream Setbacks & Buffers. For development subject to subdivision, site plan, or conditional use review, the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment may require increased setback and buffer distances, limited or shared access to surface waters, a buffer management plan and/or other mitigation or enhancement measures to protect water quality and riparian habitat.  A geomorphic assessment, prepared by a qualified professional or geomorphologist approved by the town, may be required to determine appropriate stream setback and buffering requirements. 

(E) 
Delineation of Wetland Boundaries. Upon receipt of an application for subdivision or land development within 50 feet of a potentially significant wetland, as informed by the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) map, the Vermont Significant Wetland Inventory (VSWI) map, and Charlotte’s wetland planning map entitled “Wetlands of Charlotte Vermont”, all as most recently amended, the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment may require the applicant to provide a delineation of wetland boundaries within an area bounded by the nearer of either 200 feet from any proposed site improvements or the property line, unless the adjoining property-owner allows delineation on his/her property, in which case the delineation shall extend the full 200 feet regardless of property line. Such delineation shall be performed by a qualified professional in accordance with accepted federal and state methodologies to determine the wetland classification, and whether or not the wetland is significant and warrants protection. 

(F) 
Wetland Permits. In order to protect water quality and wetland functions, land development in or near a classified wetland or buffer may require a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers or the State of Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.  

(G)

(b) Telecommunications towers shall be located a distance from all property lines and public rights of-way that is at least equal to their total height, including attached antennas, unless otherwise permitted by the Board of Adjustment if tower design and construction guarantees that it will collapse inwardly upon itself, and that no liability or risk to adjoining private or public property shall be assumed by the municipality. 
(I) 
Monitoring Protocol. The Selectboard may, as the technology changes, amend these bylaws to require the use of testing protocols other than the approved monitoring protocol. A copy of the currently approved monitoring protocol (see Monitoring Protocol in Subsection (F)) shall be on file with the Town Clerk.  

(1) 	Pre-transmission Testing.  After the granting of a conditional use permit and before applicant’s telecommunications facilities begin transmission, the applicant shall submit a report, prepared by a qualified telecommunications or radio frequency engineer, on the cumulative background levels of non-ionizing radio frequency radiation around the proposed telecommunications facility site and/or any repeater locations to be utilized for applicant’s telecommunications facilities. The engineer shall use the monitoring protocol, or one substantially similar. This report shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator, who may verify the results using an independent consultant. 

(2) 	
Post-transmission Testing. After transmission begins, the owner of the tower or facility shall provide testing of the site as follows: 

(a) 	
There shall be routine annual monitoring of emissions/exposure by a qualified engineer using actual field measurement of radiation, utilizing the Monitoring Protocol. This monitoring shall measure levels of non-ionizing radio frequency radiation (RFR) exposure at the telecommunications facility site and any repeaters. Each permittee shall provide a list of the most recent RFR readings at or near the site, their distances from the tower/transmitter, dates of the readings, and the name of the person and company who took the readings and verify the operational levels of each telecommunications transmitter at the time of testing. In addition, each permittee shall provide additional RFR readings taken at sensitive areas within 3 miles of the proposed tower.  A report should indicate whether other permittees at the facility were notified prior to testing that RFR monitoring would occur.  The notification should be attached to the report. 

(b) 	
A report of the monitoring results shall be prepared by the engineer and submitted to the Zoning Administrator, who may verify the results using an independent consultant.  In the case of co-located telecommunications equipment, permittee may bill all telecommunications providers and the telecommunications facilities owner(s) equally or according to a predetermined proportionality. 

(c) 	
In the event of any major modification of existing telecommunications facility, or the activation of any additional channels, the telecommunications facility owner(s) shall immediately perform new monitoring, as described in this Section. Minor changes, such as slight changes in frequency, shall not require additional monitoring. 




Permittees shall have the opportunity to demonstrate reasons for inability to comply with these provisions. 
Charlotte Land Use Regulations 	Page 61 
(3) 	
Excessive Exposure. Should the monitoring of a telecommunications facility site reveal that the site exceeds the current FCC standard and guidelines in existence at the time of the violation, the owner(s) of all telecommunications facilities utilizing that site shall be notified. In accordance with FCC requirements, the telecommunications facility owner(s) shall immediately reduce power or cease operation as necessary to protect persons having access to the site, tower, or antennas. Additionally, the telecommunications facility owner(s) shall submit to the Deputy Health Officer a plan for the correction of the situation that resulted in excessive exposure.

Structural Inspection. Tower owner(s) shall arrange for a qualified consultant (a licensed 


professional structural engineer) to conduct inspections of the tower’s structural integrity and safety. 
Guyed towers shall be inspected every three (3) years unless there is cause to conduct an inspection more frequently. Monopoles and non-guyed lattice towers shall be inspected every five (5) years unless there is cause to conduct an inspection more frequently. A report of the inspection results shall be prepared by the consultant, and a copy shall be sent to the Zoning Administrator within 10 business days.  In the event of any major modification of the existing tower, which includes changes to tower dimensions, increase in number or types of antennas or other devices or structural modifications, the tower owner(s) shall immediately perform a new structural inspection. 
(5) 	
Unsafe Towers. Should the inspection required in subsection (4), above, reveal any structural defect(s) which, in the opinion of the qualified consultant (a licensed professional structural engineer), render(s) that tower unsafe, the tower owner(s) shall undertake the following action: 

(a) 	
Immediately upon notification of any structural defect(s) which render(s) a tower unsafe, post warnings of same at access points to the tower; notify appropriate emergency authorities; notify the Zoning Administrator, and notify the landowner and owners of record of the abutting properties within the unsafe area (minimally a 360-degree area the radius of the height of the tower); when appropriate, in consultation with emergency authorities, restrict access to the unsafe area and/or encourage evacuation of residents. 

(b) 	
Within 10 business days of notification of any structural defect(s) which render(s) a tower unsafe, submit to the Zoning Administrator a plan to correct the structural defect(s) as soon as reasonably possible. The tower owner(s) shall implement its remediation plan immediately but in no event later than 10 business days.

4.20 Energy Facility Siting and Development Standards 
General Standards 
Prioritization 
The Town will support the following types of energy development in order of priority: 
. Increased system capacity through state, utility and municipally-supported energy efficiency 
and conservation programs. 

. 	Individual and small-scale1 renewable and distributed energy projects. 
. 	In-place upgrades of existing facilities including transmission and distribution lines 
and substations. 

. 	New community-scale2 renewable and distributed energy projects. 
Areas of High Public Value (AHPV) 
Land development in Charlotte is evaluated and sited so as to avoid and / or minimize impacts to the 
following AHPV as identified in Charlotte's Town Plan and Land Use Regulations: 
. Land in active agricultural use, 

. 	Primary (prime & statewide) agricultural soils, 
. 	Steep slopes (equal to or in excess of 15%), 
1 Small scale renewable energy projects are defined as those that generate less than 150kW of energy. 
2 Community scale projects generate 150 kW to 1 mW and utility scale generate over 1 mW. Small and community 
scale projects would be considered locally sourced meaning the energy produced is produced and used in Vermont. 
Utility projects generate power that is available to the broader, merchant market. 

Charlotte Land Use Regulations 	Page 65 
. 	Flood hazard areas, 
. 	Surface waters, wetlands and associated setback and buffer areas, 
. 	Shoreland setback and buffer areas, 
. 	Special natural areas (identified in Charlotte Town Plan), 
. 	Wildlife habitat (as identified in Charlotte Town Plan or as field delineated), 
. 	Water supply source protection areas (SPAs), 
. 	Historic districts, sites and structures (as listed in Vermont State Historic Register), 
. 	Scenic views and vistas (as identified in Charlotte Town Plan), or 
. 	Conserved land on adjacent parcels. 
Excluded Areas 
Energy projects will be evaluated like other forms of land development; however, the following areas will be excluded from consideration for development of new energy projects: 
. 	Conservation District 
. 	Areas 150’ or less from mean high water level for Lake Champlain, unless mounted on an existing structure. 
. 	Steep slopes (equal to or in excess of 15%), 
. 	Flood hazard areas (Flood Hazard Overlay District), and river (and stream) corridors as defined by VTANR, 
. 	Lands conserved for purposes contrary to energy project development (e.g. buffer to neighboring property during subdivision review, agriculture, other utility easement areas etc.) 
Use Classification 
A small-scale, net-metered or off-grid renewable energy facility (generally less than or equal to 15kW) intended solely to serve an individual residence or business, will be considered an accessory structure allowed in all zoning districts in which structures areallowed. 
Larger scale projects, including power generation facilities; transmission and distribution lines; group, net-metered facilities; substations; and other projects requiring a certificate of public good from the Public Service Board will be reviewed utilizing the standards under Section 5.5 Site Plan Review as amended herein.  These projects will also be subject to review under Section 3.12 Performance Standards. 
Specific Use Standards Height – Zoning district height limitations under local bylaws should be waived for renewable energy projects as enabled under 24 V.S.A. Section 4414. The maximum tower height for net-metered or similar off-grid wind energy facilities shall not (a) exceed 120 feet in total height, as measured vertically from the natural ground level to the rotor tip blade at its highest point, or (b) extend in total height more than 30 feet above the existing tree canopy or other obstructions within 300 feet of the 
Page 66 	Charlotte Land Use Regulations 
tower, whichever is greater. 
No monopole or attached accessory antenna on a monopole shall exceed 120 feet in height as measured from natural ground level at the base of the pole. No monopole shall be constructed which requires guy wires. Monopoles shall not be located on buildings. 
Setbacks – Except for transmission and distribution utility lines and connections, all energy facilities including substations; small-scale net-metered or off-grid renewable energy projects; and group net-metered projects, must meet the minimum setback requirements3 for the zoning district in which they are located.  In addition, all ground-mounted wind energy facilities must be set back a distance equal to 
1.5 times the overall height of the facility, as measured vertically from the natural grade to the rotor 
blade tip at its highest point, from nearest existing residential or commercial structure on abutting 
properties and from the nearest property line and private4 or public right-of-way (including road, 
overhead utility line, trail). 

A building-mounted wind turbine or solar panel must meet minimum setback requirements for the 
building on which it is mounted. The installation of a net-metered or off-grid energy system on a 
nonconforming structure will not constitute an increase in the degree or amount of nonconformance 
under local regulations. 
Ground Clearance – The blade tip of any horizontal wind turbine at its lowest point shall have a ground clearance of no less than 30 feet. 
Noise – Noise generated by any energy facility shall not exceed the lesser of (a) 70 decibels as 
measured at any property line or (b) 10 decibels above the ambient sound level. 
Shadow Flicker – Wind energy facilities shall be sited or screened so that shadows cast by rotor blades 
will not result in shadow flicker on occupied buildings located in the vicinity of the project. 
Burial – Utility controls and onsite line connections shall be wireless or buried, except at the point of 
connection with distribution lines. 

Signs – Energy facilities and structures shall not be used for display or advertising purposes. Signs, 
except for owner and manufacturer identifications and safety warnings that do not exceed six square 
feet in total area, are prohibited on all structures. Signs shall not be higher than 10 feet from the 
average grade of the surrounding ground to the highest point of the sign or supporting structure, 
whichever is higher. 
Lighting – In accordance with Section 3.9 of the Land Use Regulations, all outdoor lighting including that associated with energy facilities shall be kept to the minimum required for safety, security and intended use. 
In the event FAA required navigation lighting is required for a project, then an Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS) or other lighting control system approved by the FAA shall be used to minimize visual lighting impacts. The FAA lighting alternative that results in the least amount of visual disturbance and minimizes project visibility from public roads and vantage points shall be incorporated into the design. 
3 Applicants should plan for necessary shadow easements as rights to such an easement are not implied through 
approval of a project that meets the minimum setback requirements. 
4 Project may be permitted closer to a private right-of-way subject to signed agreement with others who use / 
manage right-of-way if applicable.

Subdivision Review.  Subdivision review under Chapter VI, where required, will precede site plan, conditional use or flood hazard area review. In the event that a condition of site plan, conditional use or flood hazard area approval is inconsistent with the conditions of subdivision approval, the more restrictive shall apply.  A subdivision amendment may be required as appropriate. 

(B) 
Site Plan & Conditional Use Review. For development that requires both conditional use and site plan approval, the Board of Adjustment and the Planning Commissions will conduct joint hearings if practical.  Otherwise, conditional use review by the Board of Adjustment under Section 5.4 will normally precede site plan review by the Planning Commission under Section 5.5.  

(C) 
Flood Hazard Area Review. For development that requires both conditional use review under Section 5.4 and flood hazard area review under Section 5.6, the Board of Adjustment may combine conditional use, and flood hazard area review into one conditional use review process, as long as applicable notice, hearing, review standards and recording requirements under each are met.  For development that requires both site plan review under Section 5.5, flood hazard area review, flood hazard area review shall precede site plan review, and the Planning Commission shall incorporate applicable conditions of flood hazard area review within site plan review. 


Section 5.2 Development Review Application 
(A) 
An applicant for site plan, conditional use and/or flood hazard area review must submit the appropriate application form, the required fee, and the information specified in Table 5.1.  An application may not be considered complete until all necessary materials have been submitted. 

(B) 
The Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment may waive one or more required application materials if they determine that such information is unnecessary for a comprehensive review of the application. 

(C) 
In accordance with the Act [§4440(d)], the Commission or Board may request additional information as needed, including independent technical analyses to be paid for by the applicant, to determine conformance with these regulations. 


Section 5.3 Reconsideration 
An applicant or interested party may request that the Board of Adjustment or Planning Commission  reconsider any decision issued under this chapter by reopening the hearing in accordance with Section 9.9(E). The Board or Commission may also reopen a hearing on their own motion. 
Section 5.4 Conditional Use Review 
(A) 
Applicability. Any use or structure requiring conditional use approval shall not be issued a zoning permit by the Zoning Administrator until the Board of Adjustment grants such approval in accordance with the Act [§4414(3)], and the following standards and procedures. 

(B) 
Review Process. Upon determination that an application is complete, a public hearing will be warned in accordance with Section 9.9(C).  In accordance with the Act [§4464(b)] and Section 9.9(E), the Board shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove on each matter of an application for conditional use review; and shall issue a written decision within 45 days of the date of the final public 

hearing to include findings, conditions of approval, and provisions for appeal to Environmental Court.  Failure to act within the 45 day period shall be deemed approval, effective on the 46th day.  

(C) 
General Standards. In accordance with the Act [§4414(3)], the Board shall determine that the proposed conditional use shall not result in an undue adverse effect on any of the following: 

(1) 	
The capacity of existing or planned community facilities and services. The Board shall consider the demand for community facilities and services that will result from the proposed development in relation to the existing and planned capacity of such services and facilities, and the adopted municipal capital budget and program currently in effect. The Board may request information or testimony from appropriate local officials to help evaluate potential project impacts on existing and proposed community facilities and services. Conditions may be imposed regarding the provision of services and facilities, and/or the timing and phasing of development in relation to anticipated municipal capital expenditures or improvements, to minimize any adverse impacts to community facilities and services. 

(2) 	
Character of the area affected. The Board shall consider the design, location, scale, and intensity of the proposed development in relation to the character of adjoining and other properties likely to be affected by the proposed use.  Conditions may be imposed as appropriate to ensure that the proposed development is compatible with the character of the area, as defined by zoning district purpose statements, and specifically stated policies and standards of the municipal plan. Conditions may be imposed as necessary to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts, including but not limited to conditions on the design, scale, intensity or operation of the proposed use.  

(3) 	
Traffic on roads and highways in the vicinity. The Board shall consider the potential impact of traffic generated by the proposed development on the capacity, safety, efficiency, and maintenance of roads, highways, intersections, and bridges in the vicinity.  A traffic impact assessment may be required.  Conditions may be imposed as necessary to ensure that a proposed development will not result in unsafe conditions for pedestrians or motorists, including but not limited to physical improvements on or off site, or the use of accepted traffic management strategies. 

(4) 	
Bylaws in effect. The Board shall determine whether the proposed development conforms to other municipal bylaws and ordinances currently in effect, including but not limited to road, water or wastewater ordinances.  The Board shall not approve a proposed development that does not meet the requirements of other bylaws and ordinances in effect at the time of application. 

(5) 	
The use of renewable energy resources. The Board will consider whether the proposed development will interfere with the sustainable use of renewable energy resources by either diminishing their future availability on the subject parcel, or by interfering with neighboring property

(3) 	
Performance Standards. The Board shall consider whether the proposed development will meet applicable performance standards under Section 3.12, and may impose conditions on the installation, operation, storage or maintenance of devices or materials necessary to meet these standards. In determining appropriate performance standards, the Board may consult with state officials, and consider accepted industry standards.  In addition, the Board may limit hours of operation so that the use shall be consistent with the character of the area.  Evening or night operations shall be permitted only if noise levels, lighting and traffic will not unreasonably interfere with surrounding uses. 


Section 5.5 Site Plan Review 
(A) 
Applicability. In accordance with the Act [§4416], site plan review by the Planning Commission is required for all development except for agriculture, forestry, single and two family dwellings and associated accessory uses and structures (unless otherwise specified in these regulations), and subdivisions (unless a specific use is being proposed in association with a proposed subdivision and the specific use is not exempt from Site Plan Review), and except for development that is specifically exempted from these regulations under Section 9.2. 

(B) 
Purpose. Site plan review is intended to ensure that site layout and design is safe, functional, and of a scale that is compatible with its setting and context, and consistent with these regulations. 

(C) 
Sketch Plan Review. An applicant for site plan review shall submit a Sketch Plan Review application prior to the submission of an application for site plan review to discuss the project and to identify any additional application materials required to determine conformance with site plan review criteria under Subsection (D) unless deemed unnecessary by the Town Planner if proposed project or amendment is very minor.  Any request to waive application requirements under Section 5.2(B) should be submitted at this meeting. Following Sketch Plan Review, the Commission will submit a letter to the applicant listing the Commission’s suggestions for the project. 

(D) 
Review Process. Following the submission of a complete application, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing, warned in accordance with Section 9.9(C), to receive public comment on the site design and layout of a particular proposal. In accordance with the Act [§4464] and Section 9.9(E), the Planning Commission shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for site plan approval within 45 days of the final adjournment of the public hearing.  Failure to act within the 45 day period shall be deemed approval, effective the 46th day. The decision of the Planning Commission shall be issued in writing, in accordance with Section 9.9(E), to include procedures for appeal to the Environmental Court under Section 9.6, and shall be recorded in accordance with Section 9.9(F).  

(E)

Historic features on the site, including historic sites and structures, shall, to the extent feasible, be preserved and incorporated into site design and layout, and the visual context of a historic structure shall be maintained. Continued use, or the adaptive reuse of an historic structure is encouraged in accordance with Section 4.3.  
(2) 	
Site Layout & Design.   The Commission shall ensure that the size, scale, arrangement and appearance of the proposed development are in keeping and harmonious with its surroundings, and that the development will not have an undue adverse aesthetic impact on site features or the surrounding area.  Conditions may be imposed as appropriate to ensure that development is compatible with its setting and context. Accordingly: 

(a) 
The Planning Commission may require increased setback distances from property lines or public rights-of-way in relation to the height, scale, massing or density of development, and landscaping or screening to mitigate the visual impacts of development, in accordance with Subsection (6). 

(b) 
Structures should be architecturally and visually compatible with historic structures on the site and in the vicinity of the development. 

(c) 
Building should be oriented parallel to the road unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission in relation to site conditions, or to allow for solar orientation. 

(d) 
The Planning Commission will require the submittal of a visual impact analysis for utility scale projects and may also require for smaller projects where adverse aesthetic impacts are in question. The visual analysis will address views from sensitive viewing areas or within the region as a whole; and will explain measures taken by the developer to mitigate impacts of the project. Particular efforts should be made to prevent a project from becoming the focal point of scenic views. 



(3) 	
Access. Provision shall be made for adequate and safe vehicle and pedestrian access to and from the site in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2. Additionally, the Commission may:

(d) 	
require the reduction, consolidation or elimination of non-complying accesses or curb cuts; 

(e) 	
require relocation of an existing or proposed access in relation to topography, site conditions, or to improve safety and sight visibility. 

(f) 	
require pedestrian paths, walkways or trails that connect to public paths, walkways, adjoining parcels, or the town trail system. 



(4) 	
Parking, Loading, & Service Areas. On-site parking, loading and service areas shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.11. Conditions may be imposed with regard to the extent, location, landscaping, screening, paving, curbing and/or sharing of parking, loading and service areas as appropriate to ensure site safety, function and attractiveness, and to avoid or minimize adverse off-site impacts. Accordingly: 

(a) 	
Shared parking between multiple uses on the site and/or adjoining properties may be required where appropriate; common parking areas to serve multiple properties are encouraged. 

(b) 	
Parking, loading and service areas, to the extent feasible, shall be located to the side or rear of buildings. Parking is prohibited within front yard setback areas unless there is no alternative location on the lot.  

(c) 	
Relocation or redesign of existing parking areas may be required to meet all applicable requirements of these regulations. 

(d) 	
Surfaces of parking, loading and service areas shall be non-white crushed stone wherever feasible. 

(e) 	
Provision shall be made for adequate and safe on-site vehicular and non-vehicular circulation in relation to the intended use and the location of buildings and parking areas. Accordingly, a safe and attractive pedestrian environment shall be provided as appropriate to the use.  In the West and East Charlotte Village Districts, the Village Commercial Districts, and the Commercial/Light Industrial District, pedestrian paths, sidewalks and trails to nearby residential areas may be required. 



(5) 	
Landscaping & Screening. Site plans shall incorporate landscaping and screening which preserves and incorporates existing vegetation, is suited to existing site conditions, enhances development and features unique to the site, integrates the development and site with surrounding properties, and/or serves to buffer or screen incompatible or unsightly development from neighboring properties or public rights-of-way. Accordingly: 

(a) 	
In determining the amount and type of plantings to be required, at minimum the following shall be considered: local terrain, drainage, soil, weather and light conditions; the use of landscaping within the context of the overall site development plan, including vegetation to be preserved on site; the need for additional screening or buffering to mitigate adverse impacts to natural and scenic features, public rights-of-way and adjoining properties and uses. 

(b) 	
Landscaping may be required to be installed and maintained adjacent to parking, loading and outdoor storage areas, where they abut adjacent properties or public roads. Landscaping may also be required within Route 7 front setback areas. 

(c) 	
Landscaping and screening may be required in appropriate locations on the site as necessary to physically or visually separate and buffer incompatible land uses or densities of development, or 

to screen incompatible or unsightly development from public rights-of-way and neighboring properties and uses. 

(d) 	
Landscaping shall take the form of shade trees, deciduous shrubs, evergreens, well kept grasses, wildflowers, and groundcover.  Invasive, non-native species are to be avoided.  [Refer to Landscape Plants for Vermont, University of Vermont Extenstion Service, 2002.] 

(e) 	
Street trees, to include a mix of salt and drought tolerant species, may be required along public rights-of-way. 

(f) 	
The Commission also may require a three (3) year landscaping plan, and/or a bond or other surety acceptable to the Charlotte Selectboard, to ensure landscaping installation and maintenance. 



(6) 	
Stormwater Management & Erosion Control.  Stormwater management and erosion control shall be provided on-site in accordance with applicable standards under Section 7.8. In addition: 

(a) 	The site development plan shall integrate the topographic, soil and vegetation characteristics of the site to minimize site disturbance, including clearing and grading. 
(b) 	The size and extent of impervious surface may be limited by the Planning Commission to minimize stormwater runoff and erosion from the site. Solar panels / arrays will be considered when calculating lot coverage. Stormwater management and erosion control plans may also be required for utility scale energy projects. 

(7) 	
Outdoor Lighting. Information regarding the location, type and level of illumination of all outdoor lighting shall be provided.  Such lighting shall be designed in conformance with the standards set forth in Section 3.9.

i. 	
the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of flood waters expected at the site; 

j. 	
the costs of providing governmental and public facilities and services during and after a flood event; 

k. 	
other such factors as are relevant to the purpose of these regulations 



(2) 	
In Zones A, AE, AH, and A1-A30 where base flood elevations and/or floodway limits have not been determined, development shall not be permitted unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated encroachment, will not increase the base flood elevation more than 1.00 foot at any point within the community.  The demonstration must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic 

engineering principles and certified by a registered professional engineer. This determination does not apply to lands affected by Lake Champlain elevations. 

(3) 	
Development or any encroachment within floodways is prohibited unless a registered professional engineer performs a hydrologic and hydraulic analyses in accordance with standard engineering practice and certifies that the proposed development will not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, and will not increase any risk to surrounding properties, facilities, or structures from erosion or flooding. Public utilities may be placed underground within floodway areas, and the analysis may be waived, where a registered professional engineer certifies that there will be no change in grade, and the utilities will be adequately protected from scour. 

(4) 	
All development in the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) shall be designed to (a) be reasonably safe from flooding; (b) minimize flood damage to the proposed development and to public facilities and utilities; and (c) to provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and (d) located so as to minimize conflicts with changes in stream channel location over time and the need to intervene with such changes. 

(5) 	
All development, including improvements or expansions to existing structures, shall be (a) designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure during the occurrence of the base flood, (b) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, (c) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage, and (d) be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 

(6) 	
The flood and sediment transport carrying capacity within any altered or relocated portion of a watercourse shall be maintained, and any alteration or relocation shall not result in any decrease in stream stability. 

(7) 	
Replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated such that the top of the fill (the pad) under the lowest flow (i.e., the entire manufactured home) is 1 foot or more above the base flood elevation, to be documented in as-built condition through submission of a FEMA Elevation Certificate. 

(8) 	
The lowest floor, including basement, of all buildings that are to be substantially improved (as defined in Chapter X) shall be at least one foot above the base flood elevation, to be documented in as-built condition through submission of a FEMA Elevation Certificate. 

(9) 	
Existing buildings to be substantially improved for residential purposes shall be modified or elevated to meet the requirements of Subsection (D)(8). 

(10) 
Existing buildings to be substantially improved for nonresidential purposes shall either (a) meet the requirements of Subsection (D)(8), or (b) be designed so that the lowest floor, including the basement and any attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that two feet above the the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and structural components have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.  A permit for a building proposed to be flood-proofed shall not be issued until a registered professional engineer or architect has reviewed the structural design, specifications, and plans, and has certified that the design and proposed methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection. Flood-proofing measures, as constructed, shall be documented through the submission of a FEMA Floodproofing Certificate. 

(11) 
Fully enclosed areas below grade on all sides (including below grade crawl spaces and basements) are prohibited. All substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas that are above grade, below the lowest floor, below BFE and subject to flooding shall be: 

(12) 
Recreational vehicles shall either (a) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, (b) be fully licensed and ready for highway use (on its wheels, attached by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, with no permanently attached additions), or (c) meet all elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured (mobile) homes under Subsection (7) above. 

(13) 
Culverts may require a stream alteration permit from the state. 

(E) 
Other Permits. Proposed development within the flood hazard area overlay district shall also be reviewed to assure that all necessary permits have been received from federal or state agencies from which approval is required under federal or state law. 

(F) 
Variances. In addition to the standards for granting variances set forth in Section 9.7(A), requests for variances within the Flood Hazard Area Overlay District must also comply with the standards set forth in Section 9.7(C). 

(G) 
Recording Requirements. See Sections 9.9(F)(1) and 9.9(F)(2).

condition shall be clearly stated on any permits; and  
b.  Shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by  
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for meeting this requirement  
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or  
exceed the following minimum criteria: a minimum of two openings on two walls having  
a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area  
subject to flooding shall be provided.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than  
one foot above grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other  
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of  
floodwaters.

The leasing of a portion of a lot for agricultural or forestry purposes, provided no new roads are created for uses other than accepted agricultural or forestry practices. 

(C) 
Classification of Subdivisions (see Sketch Plan Review).  For the purposes of these regulations, subdivisions shall be classified by the Planning Commission in accordance with the following: 

(1) 	
Minor Subdivision, which shall include any residential subdivision, or resubdivision, of land resulting in the creation of three (3) or fewer lots within any 10 year period, regardless of any change in ownership. Minor Subdivisions requires Final Plan Approval (see Section 6.5).  Applications for Final Plan Approval will be reviewed under the standards within Chapter VII, and if applicable, Chapter VIII. 

(2) 	
Major Subdivision, which shall include any residential subdivision, or resubdivision of land resulting in the creation of four (4) or more lots within any 10 year period, regardless of any change in ownership; and any nonresidential subdivision or PUD.  Major Subdivisions require Preliminary Approval (see Section 6.4) and Final Plan Approval (see Section 6.5). Applications for Preliminary Approval and Final Plan Approval will be reviewed under the standards within Chapter VII, and if applicable, Chapter VIII. 

(3) 	
Boundary Adjustment, which shall include any realignment of boundary lines between existing adjacent lots which are not included in an approved subdivision. Boundary Adjustments require Final Plan Approval (see Section 6.5). Applications for Boundary Adjustments will be reviewed under the standards within Chapter VII. 

(4) 	
Subdivision Amendment, which shall include changes to an approved subdivision including, but not limited to: parcel lines; or easements, building envelopes or improvements which were required by a prior subdivision approval.  A resubdivision may also be considered a Subdivision Amendment if no additional lots are to be created. Applications for Subdivision Amendments will be reviewed under 


Charlotte Land Use Regulations 	Page 79 
Chapter VI. Subdivision Review 	Adopted March 1, 2016 
the standards within Chapter VII. 
(a) 	
A Subdivision Amendment that affects three or fewer lots and which does not substantially alter the nature of the subdivision or conditions of a prior subdivision approval will be a Minor Subdivision Amendment. Minor Subdivision Amendments require Final Plan Approval (see Section 6.5). 

(b) 
A Subdivision Amendment that affects four or more lots or that will substantially alter the nature of the subdivision or conditions of a prior subdivision approval will be a Major Subdivision Amendment. Major Subdivision Amendments require Preliminary Approval (see Section 6.4) and Final Plan Approval (see Section 6.5). 


(D) Coordination with Planned Residential or Planned Unit Development Review. The review of subdivision applications for projects that are submitted as a planned residential development or a planned unit development (PRD or PUD) under the provisions of Chapter VIII shall be concurrent with the PRD/PUD review. 
Section 6.2 Waiver Authority 
(A) 
In accordance with the Act [§4418(2)(A)], the Planning Commission may waive or modify subdivision application and/or review standards set forth in Chapter VII (except density requirement) pertaining to a particular application, subject to appropriate conditions, which in its judgment: 

(1) 	
are not necessary to protect public health, safety and general welfare; or 

(2) 	
are inappropriate due to the extraordinary or unnecessary hardship that may result from strict compliance with these regulations; or 

(3) 	
are inappropriate because of an inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent to or within proximity of the subdivision. 

(B) 
The request for a waiver from subdivision application requirements and/or standards shall be submitted by the applicant in writing with the application.  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient information to justify any waiver or modification to be granted by the Commission. In granting waivers, the Commission may require such conditions that will, in its judgment, substantially meet the objectives of the requirements so waived or modified.  No such waiver may be granted if it would have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Charlotte Town Plan or varying other applicable provisions of these regulations or other municipal ordinances or regulations in effect. 


Section 6.3 Sketch Plan Review [required for all subdivisions; also required for boundary adjustments and subdivision amendments unless deemed unnecessary by the Town Planner] 
(A) 
Application Requirements.  For the purposes of classification under Section 6.1(C) and a preliminary discussion of compliance with these regulations, a applicant shall, prior to submitting an application for subdivision approval, submit to the Administrative Officer a sketch plan (or multiple plans) of the proposed subdivision and associated fee. At minimum, the following information shall be submitted to the Planning Commission: 

(1)

In the event that such subdivision plan revisions are recorded without complying with this requirement, the revisions shall be considered null and void. 
Section 7.1 Application of Subdivision Standards 
In accordance with the Act [§4418], the Planning Commission will evaluate all subdivisions and subdivision amendments in accordance with the standards set forth in Sections 7.2 – 7.12, unless specifically waived under Section 6.2.  For subdivision evaluation and approval, the Commission also may require: 
(1) 	
disclosure of the intended use of land to be subdivided, and a general indication of future development plans for retained land when only a minor portion of an existing parcel is to be subdivided; 

(2) 	
in the event the Commission determines that development of additional portions of the parcel is reasonably likely in the foreseeable future, a master plan for the entire parcel which identifies Areas of High Public Value and other common land; the general location of potential infrastructure, including road, utility, green space or recreation corridors; and an estimate of the type, density and timing of future development; 

(3) 	
an independent technical review of the proposed subdivision under one or more standards, prepared by a qualified professional, to be paid for by the applicant; or 

(4)

Section 7.2 General Standards 
Development Suitability.  All land to be subdivided shall be suitable for the intended use and proposed density of development, and shall not result in undue adverse impacts to public health and safety, public facilities and infrastructure, or the character of the surrounding area. Moreover, to the extent feasible, land development should not have an undue adverse impact on Areas of High Public Value (see Table 7.1). During the review process, the Planning Commission will identify specific characteristics of each subject parcel which may be of concern, and will prioritize those resources the Planning Commission considers most important to be addressed in the application. 
Table 7.1 Areas of High Public Value 
Areas of high public value include land characterized by: 
• 
Land in active agricultural use, 

• 
Primary (prime & statewide) agricultural soils, 

• 
Steep slopes (equal to or in excess of 15%), 

• 
Flood hazard areas, 

• 
Surface waters, wetlands and associated setback and buffer areas, 

• 
Shoreland setback and buffer areas, 

• 
Special natural areas (identified in Charlotte Town Plan), 

• 
Wildlife habitat (as identified in Charlotte Town Plan or as field delineated), 

• 
Water supply source protection areas (SPAs), 

• 
Historic districts, sites and structures,  

• 
Scenic views and vistas (as identified in Charlotte Town Plan), or 

• 
Conserved land on the same parcel or adjacent parcels. 


Chapter VII.  Subdivision Review Standards 	Adopted March 1, 2016 
(A) 
Unless otherwise allowed by the Planning Commission, subdivisions shall not designate development on those areas that are characterized by periodic flooding (including designated special flood hazard areas), wetland, very steep topography (slopes in excess of 25%), or other hazardous or clearly unsuitable conditions, or is otherwise inadequate to support structures and infrastructure. However such land may be used for lot size and density calculations. 

(B) 
Charlotte Town Plan & Regulations.  Subdivision review will be guided by the policies and recommendations set forth in the Charlotte Town Plan, other provisions of these regulations, a duly adopted capital improvement program, and all other applicable town regulations in effect at the time of application. 

(C) 
Lot Layout.  The layout of lots shall include consideration of topography, drainage, and soil conditions, and shall conform to all applicable zoning district standards (Chapter II), general regulations (Chapter III), and specific use standards (Chapter IV), including surface water, wetland, and shoreland setback and buffer requirements, and steep slope area limitations.  In addition: 

(1) 	
Zoning district lot size, frontage and density requirements under Chapter II are the minimum required, unless waived or modified by the Planning Commission for planned residential or planned unit development (see Chapter VIII), affordable housing (see Section 4.4) or access by a right-of-way (see Section 3.2). 

(2) 	
The Planning Commission may require different lot sizes than proposed by the applicant based upon site limitations and the presence of physical and natural features, and to ensure that the parcel may accommodate anticipated development without undue adverse impact to public health and safety, and to minimize undue adverse impacts to Areas with High Public Value.  

(3) 	
Corner lots shall have sufficient width to meet frontage requirements along both roads, and front yard setbacks from each road. 

(4) 	
Side lot lines shall generally form right angles to the road. 

(5) 	
Irregularly shaped lots (e.g., with curves, jogs, doglegs; excessively rectilinear, etc.) shall not be created unless warranted by topography, surface waters, or to avoid the fragmentation of significant natural or cultural features. 

(D) 
Density. Development density shall be based on the allowed densities for the zoning district(s) in which the subdivision is located.  Areas of High Public Value can be used for development density unless the property has been conserved through a legal mechanism such as a Grant of Development Rights, Conservation Easement, or Open Space Agreement. 

(E) 
Building Envelopes. All proposed lots intended for development shall include designated building envelopes within which all structures and parking areas shall be located, unless waived in accordance with Section 6.2.

(4) 	
The Planning Commission may evaluate the proposed subdivision under other standards within these Land Use Regulations. 

(5) 	
In the event the Planning Commission determines that development of additional portions of the parcel is reasonably likely in the foreseeable future, it may require a master plan showing potential future development may be required by the Planning Commission. 

(6) 	
A notice that the parcel has not been approved for sewage disposal shall be clearly stated on the approved plat and set forth in any deed conveying the property. 

(7) 	
No zoning permit shall be issued for any use on the parcel requiring sewage disposal until such time 


as the owner seeks and receives an amendment to the subdivision approval resulting in the parcel’s 
creation.  The Commission shall, in granting such an amendment, determine that the proposed 
development of the parcel conforms to all applicable standards of these regulations. 
Section 7.8 Stormwater Management & Erosion Control 
(A) 
Subdivisions shall incorporate temporary and permanent storm water management and erosion control practices as appropriate for the type and density of proposed development and lot coverage to ensure that the subdivision and subsequent development does not result in soil erosion, the degradation of surface waters and/or hazards to properties within the vicinity.  Accordingly: 

(1) 	
All stormwater management systems shall be designed to: 

(a) 	
use natural drainage systems to the extent feasible, and minimize the need for system 
maintenance, 


(b) 	
maximize on-site infiltration and treatment of storm water, and minimize surface runoff, 




Chapter VII.  Subdivision Review Standards 	Adopted March 1, 2016 
(c) 	
accommodate anticipated flows, including existing surface water runoff and total runoff generated by the proposed development at build-out, including anticipated flows from storm events, 

(d) 	
provide storage areas and treatment to manage flows and protect water quality; and 

(e) 	
avoid damage to adjoining properties and downstream drainage facilities. 


(2)

(3) 	
The applicant shall demonstrate that existing downstream drainage facilities will be able to accommodate any additional runoff from the subdivision.  If increased runoff exceeds the capacity of downstream drainage, storage or treatment facilities, the Commission may require that the applicant phase the subdivision and/or delay construction until such capacity exists, or install off-site improvements as needed to increase downstream capacity. 

(4) 	
The Planning Commission also may require project phasing to minimize the extent of soil disturbance and erosion during each phase of development. 

(5) 	
Unless the applicant provides sufficient information that supports an alternative design, or the Planning Commission determines that it is appropriate to design for a less frequent event, all drainage facilities shall be designed for the following storm frequency: 


Facilities only impacting subdivision system: 10 Year Storm 
Facilities impacting town road system: 25 Year Storm 
Facilities impacting state highway system: 50 Year Storm. 

Section 7.9 Landscaping & Screening

provide vegetative buffers to protect water quality or other natural features, in accordance with Section 3.15; 

(3) 	
provide a buffer between developed and undeveloped areas of the subdivision, or the subdivision and adjoining properties, to increase privacy, reduce noise or glare, or to establish a barrier between incompatible land uses, including between residential and agricultural uses in accordance with Section 7.4; and/or 

(4) 	
establish or maintain a tree canopy along roads or pedestrian paths where the Planning Commission deems it appropriate. 

(5) 
The Commission also may require a three (3) year landscaping plan, and/or a bond or other surety acceptable to the Charlotte Selectboard, to ensure landscaping installation and maintenance. 


Section 7.10 Roads, Driveways & Pedestrian Access 
(A) 
Capacity of Existing Roads.  Traffic to be generated by the proposed subdivision will not create unreasonable traffic congestion or cause unsafe conditions on public roads in the vicinity of the proposed subdivision.  Accordingly: 

(1) 	
The Planning Commission may request the preparation of a traffic impact or safety study, the cost of which is to be borne by the applicant. 

(2) 	
Where a study identifies impacts and mitigation measures necessary to ensure traffic safety and/or efficiency, an applicant may be required to make improvements to an existing road, such as realignment or widening, or install traffic control devices on or off-site that are necessary to ensure public safety and welfare. 

(3) 	
Where the municipal plan or capital program indicate that improvements will be needed in the future on adjacent town roads, a applicant may be required to reserve land for such improvements, and show such reservations on the plat. 

(B) 
Standards. All subdivision intended for development must meet the road, driveway, and pedestrian access standards set forth in Section 3.2.

(B) 
Common Land. Land to be dedicated to shared facilities (e.g., private road, community wastewater and water supply systems, or other community facilities, ), may be held in common, and will be subject to the legal requirements set forth below and in Section 7.12.  Land and/or facilities to be held in common shall be subject to appropriate deed restrictions and/or covenants stipulating their allowed use, and establishing the person or entity responsible for their regular maintenance and long term management. All costs associated with administering and maintaining common land and associated facilities shall be the responsibility of applicant and subsequent property owners. 

(C) 
Land to be Conserved. Land to be dedicated to the preservation and maintenance of Areas with High Public Value may be held in common or individual ownership, and may be located on one or more lots, although isolating such resources on a single lot is preferred by the Town.  The ownership of the land or the benefit of an easement preserving such land shall be in a manner and form approved by the Planning Commission; such ownership or easement may be held by the municipality or a nonprofit land conservation organization, if such entities choose to accept such ownership or easement.  Conservation and agricultural easement areas (“open space areas”) shall be indicated with an appropriate notation on the final plat. 


Section 7.12 Legal Requirements 
(A) Documentation and assurances shall be provided that all required improvements and associated rights­of-way and easements and other common facilities and land will be adequately maintained either by the applicant, subsequent or other landowners, a homeowners' association, or through other accepted legal mechanism. Such documentation shall be in a form approved by the Planning Commission and filed in the Charlotte Land Records. 
Chapter VII.  Subdivision Review Standards Adopted March 1, 2016 
(B) All required improvements shall be constructed to approved specifications in accordance with a construction schedule approved by the Planning Commission.  The Commission may require that all such improvements be completed prior to the issuance of a zoning permit or certificate of occupancy for subsequent development on approved lots.

CHAPTER VIII. PLANNED RESIDENTIAL & PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

Section 8.1 Purpose 
(A) 
In accordance with the Act [§4417] for the purposes of these regulations the following two categories of Planned Unit Development are established: 

(1) 	
Planned Residential Development, and 

(2) 	
Planned Unit Development. 

(B) 
Planned Residential Development (PRD). PRD provisions are intended to allow clustering of residential development and innovative design to promote the most appropriate use of land and the preservation of Areas of High Public Value identified in Table 7.1; 

(C) 
Planned Unit Development (PUD). PUD provisions are intended to allow compact, mixed-use, pedestrian scale development in village centers and commercial districts, innovative design and layout, and more efficient use of land in order to maintain Charlotte’s traditional settlement patterns; 


Section 8.2 Applicability 
(A) 
To achieve the purposes set forth in Section 8.1, the Planning Commission may modify applicable area and dimensional requirements required elsewhere in these regulations simultaneously with the approval of a subdivision plan and associated plat. [Density requirements cannot be modified except as allowed under Section 4.4 and/or Section 8.4(C)(2)]. Such modifications shall be made in accordance with the following provisions. 

(B) 	
Planned Residential Development (PRD) provisions shall be applied to any of the following: 

(1) 
All major subdivisions. 

(2) 
All subdivisions proposed within the East Charlotte Village District, West Charlotte Village District, the Village Commercial District or the Commercial/Light Industrial District in which the proposed uses of the subdivided parcels are exclusively residential and associated accessory uses. 

(3) 
Minor subdivisions in the Rural District or Shoreland Districts in which the applicant or the Planning Commission determine that the modification of dimensional standards that allow the clustering of development, such as a reduction in the minimum lot size or building setbacks, is desirable or necessary to meet the standards set forth in Chapter 7. 

(C) 	
Planned Unit Development (PUD) provisions shall be applied to the following: 

(1) 	
All proposed subdivisions within the East Charlotte Village District, West Charlotte Village District, Village Commercial District and the Commercial/Light Industrial District in which the proposed uses of the subdivided parcels are nonresidential or are a mixture of residential and nonresidential uses and associated accessory uses. 

(2) 	
The development of two or more principle uses on a single parcel within the East Charlotte Village District, West Charlotte Village District, Village Commercial District and the Commercial/Light Industrial District in which the proposed uses are nonresidential or are a mixture of residential and nonresidential uses and associated accessory uses. Such projects will submit applications and be reviewed as subdivisions, even though the development is proposed to be located on a single parcel. 


Section 8.3 Coordination with Other Review Processes 
The Planning Commission, Zoning Board, and all other town boards or commissions should attempt to coordinate review processes for all applications for development. 
(A) 
Subdivision Review. Applications for PRDs and PUDs shall be reviewed concurrently with applications for minor or major subdivision review, whichever is applicable, in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in Chapter VI. 

(B) 
Site Plan Review. Applications for Site Plan Review may be reviewed concurrently with an application for subdivision for the same lot, including PRD or PUD approval. Approval granted by the Planning Commission under this section for a PRD or PUD that involves a type of development that requires site plan approval under Section 5.5 shall not exempt the proposed development from such site plan review. 

(C) 
Conditional Use Review.  Approval granted by the Planning Commission under this section for a PUD or PRD that involves the development of one or more conditional uses shall not exempt the proposed development from conditional use review in accordance with Section 5.4. 


Section 8.4 Planned Residential Developments [PRDs] 
(A) 
Application Requirements.  Applications for PRDs shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements set forth in Chapter 6.  In addition to and simultaneous with the submission of application materials specified in Table 6.2, applications for PRDs must include the following: 

(1) 	
A statement setting forth the nature of all proposed modifications or changes of existing land use regulations and the standards and criteria which the applicant proposes for the development, including standards for the design, bulk and spacing of buildings and sizes of lots and open spaces; and 

(2) 	
A brief summary of the project and how it meets the standards set forth in this section. 

(B) 
General Standards.  In addition to applicable subdivision standards in Chapter VII, PRDs shall meet the following: 

(1) 	
The PRD shall be an effective and unified treatment of the development possibilities of the site, which is consistent with the goals and policies of the Charlotte Town Plan. 

(2) 	
A PRD shall include only residential uses and associated accessory structures and uses allowed within the district in which the PRD is located. Dwelling units may, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, be of varied types, including single-family, two-family, or multi-family construction, and may be attached or detached.  In no case shall the multi-family dwellings exceed four (4) dwelling units per building, unless the dwelling units are affordable housing as defined in Section 4.4., and meet the requirements of Table 4.1b. Associated uses may include, but not be limited to, those uses allowed within single dwelling units, such as home occupations and home child care. 

(3) 	
The overall density of the project shall not exceed the density which could be permitted, in the Planning Commission's judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots which meet the standards for the district(s) in which the land is situated, except where specifically allowed in these regulations as provided for in Section 4.4 and/or Subsection (C)(2) below. 

(4) 	
With the approval of the Planning Commission, two (2) or more contiguous or noncontiguous parcels may be combined in a single application for review as a PRD. The removal of density from one parcel for use on another parcel shall meet the requirements of Subsection (F). 

`The Planning Commission, in addition to applying subdivision standards under Chapter VII, may impose further restrictions on the height and spacing of buildings; and greater setback and screening requirements for structures, parking areas and other development along the perimeter of the project, and between built and conservation/open space areas to mitigate any adverse impacts on adjoining properties, uses or resource areas. 

(5) 	
In order to approve a PRD, the Planning Commission must find: 

(a) 	
that the project will minimize the adverse affects upon the resources identified as significant in Table 7.1 (Areas of High Public Value); and 

(b) 	
the development area is appropriate for the proposed density, in terms of the existing settlement pattern, the zoning district, and the standards in Chapter VII. 



(C) 
Rural District and Shoreland District Standards. In addition to the general standards set forth under Subsection (B), PRDs within the Rural District and Shoreland District shall be designed to blend new development into the historic, agricultural landscape and to maintain important natural, scenic and cultural resources as described in the Charlotte Town Plan.  To this end, PRDs shall be designed in accordance with the standards for either conservation projects or hamlets, as described below: 

(1) 	
Conservation Projects.  At the request of the applicant, or as otherwise required under Section 8.2(B), the proposed PRD shall be designed in a manner that maximizes the reduction of lot sizes and modification of setbacks and other dimensional standards to minimize undue adverse impacts to, and fragmentation of, Areas with High Public Value.  The conservation subdivision design process described in Table 6.3 shall be followed by the applicant, and modifications to standards shall be allowed by the Commission to the extent that such modifications better achieve the standards set forth under Chapter 7.  A minimum of 50% of the lot(s) shall be designated as open space in accordance with Section 8.6. 

(2) 	
Hamlets. At the request of the applicant, proposed PRDs may be designed in a manner that replicates a traditional hamlet, characterized by a concentration of residential buildings and associated accessory, cultural and/or recreational uses and structures, which are bounded by farmland or forest. To replicate this traditional a pattern, hamlets shall be designed in accordance with the following: 

(a) 	
the parcel(s) shall comprise a minimum of 40 acres; 

(b) 	
a contiguous grouping of dwellings, associated accessory, cultural or community buildings, shall be located within a compact area not to exceed 15% of the total project acreage; 

(c) 	
a minimum of 80% of the parcel(s) shall be designated as open space in accordance with Section 

8.6 – one or more common or public areas (e.g., village green or park) may be applied toward this requirement; 

(d) 	
a density bonus of up to 25% of the permitted overall density may be allowed; 

(e) 	
building envelopes or footprints shall be configured to front upon road(s) and/or a common green, so that buildings will be oriented toward the road, one another and/or the common green; and 

(f) 	
the project creates a well-defined edge between the hamlet and surrounding open space – in the event that non-contiguous parcels are involved a minimum of 50% of the designated open space shall be located immediately adjacent to the dwellings to ensure the pattern of compact hamlet surrounded by open countryside. 




Charlotte Land Use Regulations 	Page 101 
(D) 
Village Standards. In addition to the general standards set forth under subsection (B), PRDs within the East Charlotte Village District, West Charlotte Village District, Village Commercial District and the Commercial/Light Industrial District shall be designed so that the layout and configuration of lots and the subsequent placement of buildings are consistent with the historic pattern and scale of development found within these villages, and with historic structures in the vicinity.  At minimum, PRDs located within these districts shall: 

(1) 
Incorporate the following features in the subdivision design: 

(a) 	
pedestrian scale and orientation, as determined by the location and size of building envelopes or footprints; 

(b) 	
functional and visual integration with neighboring properties, especially if the site incorporates, or is adjacent to, historic districts, neighborhoods, sites or structures; 

(c) 	
an interconnected network of streets and well defined streetscapes; and 

(d) 	
sidewalks and pathways to facilitate pedestrian circulation. 



(2) 
Include at least 50% open space, common areas, or land dedicated to public use, such as a village green or park, which serve as a central organizing feature within the subdivision. Where subdivisions abut the Rural District, the location of building envelopes and configuration of lots and open space shall reinforce a well defined contrast between the compact village and the surrounding rural countryside. 

(3) 
Accommodate a scale of development that is compatible with the scale and massing of neighboring structures.  To this end, the Commission may, as a condition of subdivision approval, establish a maximum gross floor area, building footprint and/or building height for structures to be constructed on the subdivided parcel that are more restrictive than the standards set forth in Chapter II. 

(E) 
PRDS in Two or More Districts. In the event that all or a portion of one or more parcels involved in a single PRD is located in a different zoning district than another involved parcel, the total allowable density shall be calculated based on the dimensional standards for each district established in Chapter II, and the total acreage of each parcel(s) located within the respective district. 

(F) 
PRDs Involving Two or More Parcels. Two or more parcels, whether contiguous or non-contiguous may be combined in a single application for review as a PRD. Prior to approving such an application, the Planning Commission shall determine that the application complies with the standards of this Section as well as the following standards: 

(1) 	
Total density based upon the cumulative acreage of the parcels may be aggregated unto a single parcel to allow for greater concentrations of development and corresponding preservation of open space, providing the overall density for the combined parcels does not exceed that which could be permitted, 


in the Planning Commission’s judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots in conformance with 
these regulations. 
(2) 	
The application will result in the conservation of resources identified in Table 7.1 and the Charlotte Town Plan. 

(3) 	
The area to be developed is appropriate for the proposed density, such as a hamlet, village, or other settlement area. 

(4) 	
Density from parcels located within the Rural and Shoreland Districts may be aggregated onto parcels located within the Rural, Shoreland, East and West Charlotte Village Districts; and density from parcels located within the East and West Charlotte Village District may be aggregated onto parcels located elsewhere within those same village districts.  In no case shall density from parcels located in 

the East and West Charlotte Village Districts be aggregated onto parcels located within the Rural or Shoreland Districts. 

(5) 	
Density from one parcel may be aggregated onto another parcel only in whole increments of one (1) dwelling unit per five (5) acres.  The number of units removed from a parcel to be protected as open space shall be added to the maximum number of units allowed on the parcel to be developed as prescribed by applicable district standards. Any parcel(s) which retains a portion of the total allowable density that is not proposed for development as part of an approved PRD shall retain a minimum of five (5) acres per dwelling unit. 

(6) 	
The aggregation of density from one or more parcels onto another parcel shall be administered in accordance with the following: 

(a) 	
The removal of density from a parcel shall be accomplished through a conservation easement, of a form and content approved by the Planning Commission, to be recorded in the Charlotte Land Records.  Such easement shall specify that the protected portions of the parcel are to be used only for open space, agriculture, forestry and non-commercial outdoor recreation purposes. No structures or roads are to be allowed within the conservation easement area.  Wastewater disposal may be allowed within the conservation easement area if it does not disrupt, detract from or limit the values for which the conservation area is to be protected. In addition, the easement shall be accompanied by a recordable plat which clearly depicts: 

(i) 	
the boundaries of the parcel; 

(ii) 	
the boundaries of the portion of the parcel to be designated as open space and restricted by the conservation easement; and 


(iii) 	the total, unallocated density available under current zoning regulations prior to the PRD approval, and shall specify the total reduction of density resulting from that approval, in tabular format. 

(b) 	
The aggregation of density on a parcel shall be accomplished through a written agreement, approved by the Planning Commission concurrently with PRD approval under this Chapter. Said written agreement shall be of a form and content approved by the Commission, and may be in the form of a written decision approving the PRD, and shall be recorded in the Charlotte Land Records.  Such agreement shall specify the total density being aggregated onto the parcel from other parcels and shall include a deed reference to the easement covering the parcel(s) from which the density originated. 



(7) 	
The density from parcels subject to conservation easements or comparable deed restrictions may not be used to increase the allowable density on another parcel, ie: other than the parcel which is identified in the application as the parcel designated for increased density. 


Section 8.5 Planned Unit Developments [PUDs] 
(A) 
Application Procedure.  Applications for PUD shall be submitted as, or simultaneously with applications for major subdivision under Chapter VI.  In addition to the information required for sketch plan review under Section 6.3, applications for PUDs must include the following: 

(1) 	
A statement setting forth the nature of all proposed modifications or changes of existing land use regulations and the standards and criteria which the applicant proposes for the development, including standards for the design, bulk and spacing of buildings and sizes of lots and open spaces. 

(2) 	
A brief summary of the project and how it meets the standards in this section. 


Charlotte Land Use Regulations 	Page 103 
(3) 	
In instances in which a applicant proposes development of a portion of a larger parcel, or development of a parcel contiguous to another parcel(s) in common or affiliated ownership, a general indication of the intended use of the remaining (undeveloped) portion of the land, in accordance with Section 7.1. 

(4) 	
Any additional information required by the Planning Commission to determine whether the proposed mix of uses, density and scale and intensity of uses will meet the standards set forth in Chapter VII and below. 

(B) 
General Standards. In addition to the subdivision standards set forth in Chapter VII, PUDs shall meet the following: 

(1) 	
The PUD shall be an effective and unified treatment of the development possibilities of the site, which is consistent with the goals and policies of the Charlotte Town Plan. 

(2) 	
A PUD may include any use allowed within the district(s) in which it is located, including a mix of residential and nonresidential development, and associated accessory structures and uses. Dwelling units within a PUD may, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, be of varied types, including single-family, two-family, or multi-family construction, and may be attached or detached.  In no case shall multi-family dwellings exceed six (6) dwelling units per building, except as provided in Section 

4.4 and for Elderly Housing. 

(3) 	
A greater concentration or intensity of development may be located within some portion(s) of the site provided there is an offset by a lesser concentration in another portion(s) or an appropriate reservation of open space on the remaining land in accordance with Section 8.6.  

(4) 	
The overall density of the project shall not exceed the density allowed, in the Planning Commission's judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots in accordance with the standards for the district(s) in which the land is situated, except as provided for in Section 4.4 with regard to PUDs that incorporate affordable housing. 

(5) 	
A PUD may involve the creation of separate building lots, or may include a development in which multiple buildings and uses are constructed on a single parcel in common ownership. 

(6) 	
The PUD shall be designed to establish or extend an interconnected network of streets, and distinct streetscapes defined by consistent building setbacks, sidewalks, and street trees. 

(7) 	
Provision shall be made for year-round pedestrian circulation within the site, and for pedestrian access to adjacent properties.  Pedestrian circulation should include a network of pathways and sidewalks connecting existing land uses within and adjacent to the site. Provision for safe and efficient transit access also may be required. 

(8) 	
Buildings envelopes (or footprints) shall front toward and relate to streets, entrance drives and public spaces (e.g. greens, parks, plazas), both functionally and visually, and not be oriented toward parking lots.  Proposed building envelopes (or footprints and elevations) shall reflect a diversity of building scale and massing. Excessively large, monolithic buildings shall be avoided.  Lots and building envelopes within Village Districts shall be configured to be consistent with the pattern created by historic structures within the district/vicinity. 

(9) 	
Proposed building sites shall be clustered and integrated within a compact village pattern, present a well-defined edge between the built environment and surrounding open space, and visually enhance village entrances. 

(10) 
Site design and landscaping shall be compatible with neighboring properties. In instance in which a PUD abuts a residential property, greater setback requirements for structures and parking areas and appropriate screening may be required. 

(11) 
All proposals shall demonstrate the extent to which they protect and utilize renewable energy resources through such means as developing south-facing slopes in lot layout and enabling solar access to all future buildings. 

(C) 
PUDS in Two or More Districts. In the event that a parcel involved in a single PUD is located in two or more zoning districts, the total allowable density shall be calculated based on the dimensional standards for each district established in Chapter II, and the total acreage of each portion of the parcel located within the respective district. 

(D) 
PUDs on Two or More Parcels.  Two or more contiguous or non-contiguous parcels may be combined for review as a PUD.  For such PUDs that incorporate residential uses, the permitted number of dwelling units on one parcel may be increased as long as the overall number of units for the combined 


parcels does not exceed that which, in the Planning Commission’s judgement, should be permitted if the 
land were subdivided into lots in conformance with these regulations. 
Section 8.6 Open Space & Common Land 
(A) 
PRDs and PUDs shall make adequate provision for the protection of open space and common land in accordance with Section 7.11, Section 7.12 and the following provisions. In determining the appropriateness of the open space and common land, the applicant and the Planning Commission shall consider the location, shape, size, and character of the designated open space and common land relative to the size, density, topography, and the number and type of units proposed in the PRD or PUD.  In designating open space and/or common land, applicants and the Planning Commission shall consider the location of the project and associated site features as identified in Table 8.1. 

(B) 
In addition to the considerations set forth in section 8.6(A) and Table 8.1, open space and common land shall be delineated in accordance with the following standards: 

(1) 	
Open space shall provide for the protection of resources on the site including agricultural land, productive woodland, wildlife habitat, natural areas, aquifer protection areas, wetlands, views and vistas, streams, stream banks, the lake shoreline, and historic and archeological sites.

A copy of the decision and findings of fact shall be issued as provided under Section 9.9(E). 

(B) 
Planning Commission & Board of Adjustment Decisions. In accordance with the Act [§4471], an interested person who has participated in a proceeding of the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment may appeal a decision rendered in that proceeding within 30 days of such decision to the Vermont Environmental Court. In addition: 

(1) 	
“Participation” in a proceeding shall have consisted of offering, through oral or written testimony, evidence or a statement of concern related to the subject of the proceeding.  

(2) 	
The notice of appeal shall be filed by certified mailing, with fees, to the Environmental Court, and by mailing a copy to the Charlotte Town Clerk, or the Zoning Administrator if so designated, who shall supply a list of interested persons to the appellant within five (5) working days.  Upon receipt of the list of interested persons, the appellant shall, by certified mail, provide a copy of the notice of appeal to every interested person.  If any one or more of those persons are not then parties to the appeal, upon motion they shall be granted leave by the court to intervene. 


Section 9.7 Variances 
(A) 
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances in accordance with the Act [§§4424(E), §4469(a)] and associated appeal procedures under Section 9.6(A).  A variance may be granted upon approval of the Board only if enforcement of these regulations will result in an undue hardship. The Board may grant a variance, and render a decision in favor of the appellant, only if all of the following facts are found, and the findings are specified in its written decision: 

(1) 	
There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of these regulations in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located. 

(2) 	
Because of these physical circumstances and conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning regulation and that the authorization of a variance is necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property. 

(3) 	
The unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant. 

(4) 	
The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, or be detrimental to the public welfare. 

(5) 	
The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from these regulations and from the plan. 

(B) 
Renewable Energy Structures. Where a variance is requested for a structure that is primarily a renewable energy resource structure (solar structure, wind generator, and other similar renewable energy structures), in accordance with the Act [§4469(b)], the Board may grant such variance only if all of the following facts are found in the affirmative and specified in its written decision: 

(1) 	
It is unusually difficult or unduly expensive for the appellant to build a suitable renewable energy resource structure in conformance with these regulations. 

(2) 	
The hardship was not created by the appellant. 

(3) 	
The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, or be detrimental to the public welfare. 

(4) 	
The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from these regulations and from the plan. 

(C) 
Variances within the Flood Hazard Area.  In addition to requirements under Subsection (A), variances for development within the Flood Hazard Overlay District shall be granted by the Board of Adjustment only in accordance with all of the following: 

(1) 	
in accordance with the Act [§§1403(B), 4424, 4469] and the criteria for granting variances found in 44 CFR Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations; 

(2) 	
upon determination that during the base flood discharge the variance will not result in increased flood levels; 

(3) 	
upon determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety; and, 

(4) 	
Any variance issued within the Flood Hazard Area Overlay District shall include, in writing over the signature of a community official as part of the decision, a statement that: “The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation increases risk to life and property and will result in increased flood insurance premiums up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of 


coverage.”  Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(D) In granting a variance under this section, the Board of Adjustment may impose conditions it deems necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the purposes of these regulations and the municipal plan currently in effect.  In no case shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance for a use or condition prohibited in the applicable zoning district, or a variance which results in a density increase. 
Section 9.8 Violations & Enforcement 
(A) 
Violations. The commencement or continuation of any land development, subdivision or use that is not in conformance with the provisions of these regulations or conditions of a permit or approval shall constitute a violation.  All violations will be pursued in accordance with the Act [§§4451, 4452]. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. The Zoning Administrator shall institute in the name of the town any appropriate action, injunction or other proceeding to enforce the provisions of these regulations. All fines imposed and collected for violations shall be paid over to the town. 

(B) 
Notice of Violation. No action may be brought under this section unless the alleged offender has had at least seven (7) days notice by certified mail that a violation exists, as required under the Act [§4451].  The warning notice shall state that a violation exists, that the alleged offender has an opportunity to cure the violation within seven (7) days, and that the alleged offender will not be entitled to an additional warning notice for a violation occurring after the seven-day period. Action may be brought without notice and opportunity to cure if the alleged offender repeats the violation of the regulations after the seven-day notice period and within the next succeeding 12 months. 

Violation, Notice, and Enforcement pertaining to the Flood Hazard Area Overlay District. A copy of the notice of violation will be mailed to the State NFIP Coordinator.  If the violation remains after all appeals have been resolved, the Administrative Officer shall submit a declaration to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program requesting a denial of flood insurance for the property pursuant to Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. 

(C) 
Limitations on Enforcement. An action, injunction or other enforcement proceeding relating to the failure to obtain or comply with the terms and conditions of any required or duly recorded municipal land use permit or condition of an approval may be instituted against the alleged offender only if the action, injunction or other enforcement proceeding is instituted within 15 years from the date the alleged 

violation first occurred, and not thereafter, in accordance with the Act [§4454]. The burden of proving the date the alleged violation first occurred shall be on the person against whom the enforcement action is instituted.  No enforcement proceeding may be instituted to enforce an alleged violation of a municipal land use permit that has not been recorded in the land records of the municipality in accordance with Section 9.9(F). 

(D) 
Violations of the accepted Agricultural Practices shall be immediately reported to the Secretary of Agriculture for enforcement under 6. V.S.A. §4812.

notify the applicant prior to the public hearing if the Committee finds that the application fails to meet one or more of the review standards, giving the applicant the opportunity to either address and correct identified deficiencies, or withdraw the application; and 

• 	
suggest to the applicant remedies to correct identified deficiencies. 



(B) 	
Fee Schedule. In accordance with the Act [§4440], the Selectboard may establish a schedule of 


reasonable fees to be charged in administering these regulations with the intent of covering the town’s 
administrative costs.  Such fees may include the cost of posting and publishing notices, holding public hearings, and conducting periodic inspections during the installation of public improvements. Fees may be required to be payable by the applicant upon submission of an application or prior to the issuance of a permit or approval. In addition:

(c) 	
written notification to the applicant and to owners of all properties adjoining the property subject to development, without regard to public or private rights-of-way, which includes a description of the proposed project, information that clearly informs the recipient where additional information may be obtained, and that participation in the proceeding is a prerequisite to the right to take any subsequent appeal; 

(d)

An action will be invalid when the defective posting or notice was materially misleading in content. 

(D) 	
Meetings & Hearings. 

(1) 	
Board of Adjustment & Planning Commission. In accordance with the Act [§§4461, 4464], all meetings and hearings of the Board of Adjustment and Planning Commission, except for deliberative and executive sessions, shall be open to the public. In addition:

(E) 
Decisions. The Board or Commission shall issue a decision within 45 days after the adjournment of the hearing.  Failure to issue a decision within the 45-day period shall be deemed approval and shall be effective the 46th day.  

(1) 	
Form. All decisions shall be issued in writing and shall separately state findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Findings of fact shall explicitly and concisely restate the underlying facts that support the decision, based exclusively on evidence of the record. Conclusions shall be based on the findings of fact.  The decision shall also include a statement of the time within which appeals may be taken under Section 9.6.

the submission of a three (3)-year performance bond, escrow account, or other form or surety acceptable to the Charlotte Selectboard, which may be extended for an additional three (3)-year period with the consent of the owner, to assure the completion of a project, adequate stabilization, or protection of public facilities that may be affected by a project; and/or 

(b) 	
a requirement that no certificate of occupancy or certificate of compliance be issued for an approved development until required improvements have been satisfactorily installed in accordance with the conditions of approval. 



(3)

Appeals and Reconsideration. 


(a)  	Appeals. Decisions of the Board of Adjustment and Planning Commission may be appealed to the Vermont Environmental Court by the applicant or an interested person who participated in the proceeding.  Such appeals must be taken within 30 days of the date that the permit is issued, pursuant to 24 V.S.A. Section 4471 and Rule 5(b) of the Vermont Rules for Environmental Court Proceedings. 
(b) 	Reconsideration. At the request of the applicant or interested parties, or on its own motion, the Board of Adjustment or Planning Commission may reopen a public hearing for reconsideration of findings, conclusions, or conditions of the decision.  A request by the applicant or interested parties must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Office within the 30-day appeal period in accordance with Section 9.6(B). To reopen a hearing on its own motion, the Board of Adjustment or Planning Commission must approve such a motion within the 30-day appeal period. 
1) 	In order to reopen a public hearing the Board or Commission must find that new evidence can be presented that could not have previously been presented which indicates a substantial change of conditions or circumstances, or that the prior decision was induced by fraud, surprise, error or oversight, or that an unintended negative consequence will result.  
2) 	The reopened hearing will be warned in accordance with Section 9.9(C).  
3) 	The submission of a request for reconsideration will terminate the running of the 30 day appeal period.  A new 30 day appeal period will start after the Board or Commission either 1) decides to not reopen the hearing, or 2) votes to reopen and issues a reconsidered decision on the application. 
(5) 	
Expiration. Approvals granted by the Board or Commission under these regulations, except for legally recorded subdivision plats, shall expire two (2) years from the date of issuance if development has not commenced within that time. The Board or Commission may grant a longer approval period to accommodate phased development, or for development that reasonably requires a longer period of time for project commencement.  In addition, the Board or Commission may grant a single two-year extension of an approval if the extension is requested prior to the approval expiration date, and the Board or Commission determines that conditions are essentially unchanged from the time of the initial approval. 

(6) 	
Administrative Review. In accordance with the Act [§4464(c)], any decision issued by the Board of Adjustment or Planning Commission may authorize that subsequent changes or amendments to an approved project may be allowed subject to administrative review by the Zoning Administrator, rather than Board or Commission review, in accordance with the following: 

(a) 	
The decision shall clearly specify the thresholds and conditions under which administrative review and approval shall be allowed. 

(b) 	
The thresholds and conditions shall be structured such that no new development shall be approved that results in substantial impact under the requirements of these regulations, or under any of the thresholds or conditions set forth in the decision. 

(c) 	
An administrative review shall not have the effect of substantially altering the findings of fact of any Board or Commission approval in effect. 

(d) 	
Any decision of the Zoning Administrator authorized in this manner may be appealed to the Board in accordance with Section 9.6(A). 



(F) 	
Recording Requirements. 

(1) 	
Within 30 days of the issuance or denial of a municipal land use permit, or notice of violation, the Zoning Administrator shall deliver either the original, a legible copy, or a notice of a municipal land use permit, denial or violation to the Town Clerk for recording in the land records of the town as 

provided in 24 V.S.A. §1154, and as required under the Act [§4449(c)]. The applicant may be charged reasonable recording costs.

(a) 	
all permits issued for development in areas of special flood hazard; 

(b) 	
elevation certificates that show the as-built elevation, (consistent with the datum of the elevation on the current Flood Insurance Rate Maps for the community in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved buildings (not including accessory buildings) in the Special Flood Hazard Area; 

(c) 	
an elevation certificate with the as-built elevation, (consistent with the datum of the elevation on the current Flood Insurance Rate Maps for the community in relation to mean sea level), to which buildings have been floodproofed; 

(d) 	
all floodproofing certifications required under this regulation; and 

(e) 	
all variance actions, including the justification for their issuance. 



(G)

Section 10.1 Terms & Uses 
(A) 
Except where specifically defined herein or in the Act, or unless otherwise clearly required by the context, all words, phrases and terms in these regulations shall have their usual, customary meanings. 

(B) 
In the interpretation of words and terms used, defined, or further described herein, the following shall apply: 

(1) 	
the particular controls the general, 

(2) 	
the present tense includes the future tense, 

(3) 	
the word "shall" is mandatory; the word "may" is permissive; the word “should” means that an activity is encouraged but not mandated. 

(C) 
For the purposes of flood hazard area regulation under Section 5.5, National Flood Insurance Program definitions contained in 44 CFR Section 59.1 are hereby adopted by reference and shall be used to interpret and enforce these regulations.  Definitions of some commonly used terms specific to the flood hazard area regulations are provided herein and designated with (FH) for “flood hazard”. 

(D) 
Any interpretation of words, phrases or terms by the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment under Section 9.6. In such cases, the Board shall base its decision upon the following definitions, state statute, and the need for reasonable and effective implementation of these regulations. The Board shall publish and update from time to time such written interpretation, to ensure consistent and uniform application of the provisions of these regulations. 


Section 10.2 Definitions 
Accepted Agricultural Practices (AAPs): Accepted practices for agriculture, including farm structures other than dwellings, as currently defined by the Secretary of the Vermont Department of Agriculture, Food and Markets (see exemptions under Section 9.2).  See also Agriculture, Farm Structure. 
Accepted Management Practices (AMPs): Accepted practices for silviculture (forestry) as currently defined by the Commissioner of the Vermont Department or Forests, Parks and Recreation (see exemptions under Section 9.2).  See also Forestry. 
Access: A defined area of ingress and/or egress between a property and an abutting road right-of-way (e.g., a curb cut) or surface water. 
Accessory Dwelling: See Dwelling/Accessory. 
Accessory Structure: A structure on a lot which is clearly and customarily related to the principal structure or use on that lot.  For residential uses these include, but may not be limited to garages, garden and tool sheds, children’s playhouses, boat houses for the storage of three (3) or fewer boats, and permanent swimming pools.  See also Accessory Dwelling, Accessory Use. 
Accessory Use: A use on a lot which is customarily related and subordinate to the principal use of that lot. See also Accessory Dwelling. 
Act: 24 V.S.A., Chapter 117, the Vermont Municipal and Regional Planning and Development Act as 
Charlotte Land Use Regulations 	Page 121 
most recently amended. 
Adaptive Reuse: The rehabilitation or renovation of an existing historically, culturally or architecturally significant structure, as listed or as eligible to be listed on the Vermont Historic Sites and Structures Survey for the Town of Charlotte or the National Register of Historic Places, or as determined by a qualified architect or architectural historian, for another use as specified in these regulations (see Section 4.3). 
Adequate Coverage: Coverage is adequate within that area surrounding a base station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmitted signal is such that the majority of the time, transceivers properly installed and operated will be able to communicate with the base station without objectionable noise (or excessive bit-error rate for digital) and without calls being dropped. In the case of cellular communications in a rural environment like Charlotte, this would be a signal strength of at least -90 dBm. It is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage, as long as the signal regains its strength farther away from the base station. The outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage, however, is that location past which the signal does not regain. 
Administrative Officer: Zoning Administrator. 
Affiliate: For the purposes of regulating telecommunications facilities, (1) when used in relation to an operator, an affiliate is another person who directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled 
by, or is under common ownership or common control with the operator, or an operator’s principal 
partners, shareholders, or owners of some other ownership interest; or (2) when used in relation to the municipality, an affiliate is any agency, board, authority or political subdivision associated with the municipality or other person in which the municipality has legal or financial interest. 
Affordable Housing: Housing that is either: (1) owned by its inhabitants, whose gross annual household income does not exceed the median income for the Burlington MSA, as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the total annual cost of the housing, including principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and condominium association fees is not more than 30 percent of the 
household’s gross annual income; or (2) rented by its inhabitants whose gross annual household income 
does not exceed 80% of the median income for the Burlington MSA, as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the total annual cost of the housing, including rent, 
utilities, and condominium association fees, is not more than 30 percent of the household’s gross annual 
income. “Perpetually affordable” shall mean housing that meets the affordability requirements of these regulations for a minimum period of 99 years from the date of first sale or lease (see Section.4.4). 
Agricultural Sales & Service: A business supplying raw materials, feed, equipment and/or support services to producers of agricultural products. 
Agriculture: As defined by the Vermont Secretary of Agriculture, to include the cultivation or other use of land for growing food, fiber, Christmas trees, maple syrup, or horticultural and orchard crops; the raising, feeding or management of livestock, poultry, equines, fish or bees; the operation of greenhouses; the production of maple sap; the on-site storage, preparation and sale of agricultural products principally produced on the farm; and the on-site production of fuel or power from agricultural products or wastes produced on the farm.  The term shall include commercial riding stables, but specifically excludes the slaughtering of animals for commercial purposes. 
As further defined by the Vermont Secretary of Agriculture, this includes agricultural production which meets one or more of the following: (A) the sale of $1000 or more of agricultural products in a normal year; or (B) the raising, feeding and management of the specified number of adult animals: four (4) equines, five (5) cattle or bison, 15 swine, 15 goats, 15 sheep, 15 fallow or red deer, 50 turkeys or geese, 100 laying hens or ducks, 250 broilers, pheasant, Chular partridge or Coturnix quail, three (3) camelids,

THOMPSON’S POINT WASTEWATER DISPOSAL SYSTEM
LEASEHOLDER GUIDELINES
Last Revised October 8, 2018
PURPOSE
These guidelines are to assist Thompson’s Point leaseholders in understanding their rights and
responsibilities as related to the Town of Charlotte Thompson’s Point Wastewater Disposal
System Ordinance.
OPERATING SEASON
The Indirect Discharge Permit restricts the discharge of wastewater to the period between April
15th and October 31st of each year. It would be a violation of that permit and therefore illegal to
discharge wastewater into the disposal fields outside of that date range.
Shutting down the wastewater system for the season requires pumping of tanks and removal of
sewer effluent from the pressurized sewer lines serving individual lots as well as the main lines.
This process requires at least two weeks to complete, and typically begins along North Shore
Road, where early freezing is most likely.
PROHIBITED DISCHARGES
Any structure listed on Schedule A may be renovated or reconstructed provided such renovation
or reconstruction does not increase occupancy of the structure. Such renovation or
reconstruction must meet the following:
A. No increase in bedrooms
B. Bathroom plumbing connections are limited to one toilet, one lavatory, one bathtub,
and one showerhead per bathroom
C. All plumbing fixtures and appliances must incorporate Low Flow Design as described
herein.
The Thompson’s Point wastewater disposal system is intended only for the treatment and
disposal of domestic sanitary waste; which includes toilet wastes, grey water, kitchen sink,
lavatory, showers, bathtubs, dishwashers and washing machines only. All such waste shall be
conveyed initially by gravity flow or a pump to a septic tank which shall be an integral part of
the treatment process. Settled effluent from the septic tank shall be discharged by a pump into a
pressurized sewer and conveyed to the treatment facility for additional treatment and disposal.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water, surface water,
groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted
industrial process waters to the public sewer.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any substances, materials, waters or wastes
if it appears likely in the opinion of the Commission that such wastes can harm the public sewer
or sewage treatment process, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute
a nuisance. 
Thompson’s Point Wastewater Disposal System: Leaseholder Guidelines Page 2 of 3
The installation or use of garbage disposals is prohibited.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall become liable to the Town for
any expenses, losses, or damage including, without limitation, costs of repair, fines or penalties
imposed by any court or government entity or payment in lieu thereof, and attorney’s fees.
REQUIREMENTS FOR FIXTURES
Toilets using more than 1.6 gallons per flush are specifically prohibited by the Indirect Discharge
Permit. Installation of faucets using more than 2 gallons per minute is prohibited, as is
installation of showers using more than 2 gallons per minute. Automatic dishwashers must use
3.5 gallons or less per load and clothes washing machines must use 13 gallons or less per load.
CONSERVATION AND SYSTEM PRESERVATION
There are a number of simple and inexpensive ways for each leaseholder to reduce their demand
on the system. Attention to these conservation measures will greatly increase the likelihood that
the wastewater system will not fail and surely aid in a reduction in the annual use fee billed each
leaseholder.
1. Leak detection: First, turn off all water-consumption appliances and faucets. Second,
look at your water meter. Each water meter is equipped with a red, leak detector dial. If
all plumbing fixtures within your camp are turned off and this dial continues to spin,
there is a leak. Common leaks include dripping faucets (replace the washer) and leaky
toilets (open the tank and check the float and flapper for damage and/or improper
alignment). Surprising amounts of water are wasted from such leaks.
2. Delay of use: Avoid doing laundry during peak use periods
3. Conserve water: Make certain dishwashers are full before using. Turn water off when
shaving or brushing teeth. Take shorter showers. Verify that all plumbing fixtures are
rated “low-flow”. Flush the toilet fewer times.
WASTEWATER SYSTEM COMPONENTS
All Septic Tank & Effluent Pump Station tanks (“STEP Tanks”), ejector stations, pump basins,
valve boxes, and pressurized sewer service lines are the property of the Town of Charlotte. The
System Operator, acting on behalf of the Town, is responsible for operation of the wastewater
collection system and maintenance of the individual components.
Camp plumbing up to the point of connection to either an ejector station or a STEP tank remains
the responsibility of Leaseholders.
WASTEWATER PIPING AND STEP TANKS
Most wastewater service lines have little or no soil cover. These service lines are subject to
damage from vehicle traffic.
In the event of damage to any wastewater system component, leaseholders should immediately
notify the System Operator. Damage caused by leaseholders or by contractors working for
leaseholders, will be repaired by the System Operator, at the expense of the leaseholder involved
(subject to the latest approved billing rates).
Thompson’s Point Wastewater Disposal System: Leaseholder Guidelines Page 3 of 3
ELECTRICAL POWER
For the System Operator to complete both spring start-up and fall shut-down operations,
electrical power is needed at each camp.
The leaseholders are required to maintain electrical service to wastewater pump basins and STEP
Tanks between April 1st and November 15th
.
If electrical power is not available during fall shutdown or spring startup, the Town is entitled to
reimbursement by the leaseholder for costs and expenses associated with rental and operation of
a generator as necessary to accomplish the required tasks, as well as compensation for additional
labor.
WATER METERS
Water meters are installed on each lot served by the wastewater system to provide a reliable basis
for billing. With a portion of the wastewater billing based on water meter readings, these meters
must remain accessible to the System Operator. This is critical to efficient reading of the
meters, and timely billing. Any water usage for lawns, gardening or exterior usage does not need
to be metered for wastewater purposes.
Each leaseholder is responsible for providing free access to the water meter(s) on their lot that
are used for wastewater billing. The Operator is entitled to fair compensation for return trips to
read water meters. The costs associated with return trips will be borne by the leaseholder at the
latest approved labor rates.
RECOVERY OF INCURRED COSTS FROM LEASEHOLDERS
If the Town incurs costs for work outside the scope of the System Operator contract (whether to
the System Operator or to a third party) resulting from Leaseholder actions or inactions, the
Town may recover such costs from the responsible Leaseholder, following review by the
Thompson’s Point Wastewater Advisory Committee, and approval by the Selectboard.
Requirements
1. Leaseholders are responsible for maintaining clear access to components of the
wastewater collection system.
2. Driveways and parking areas are not to be extended over components of the
wastewater collection system. Vehicle traffic over exposed or shallow-buried sewer
service lines is prohibited.
3. Any damage to wastewater components is to be reported immediately to the System
Operator.
4. Problems with wastewater components should be reported to the Operator for
repair.
5. All billing and payments to the Town shall be managed by the Town Treasurer.
