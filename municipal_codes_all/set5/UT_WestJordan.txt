ATTACHMENT A
 
1-6-9: ELECTION OF COUNCIL CHAIR AND COUNCIL VICE-CHAIR:
 
  A.  The officers of the council shall be a council chair and a council vice-
chair.
  B.  At the first regular council meeting of each year (or after a vacancy
occurs), or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the council shall elect one
(1) of its members to be council chair and another one (1) of its members to be
council vice-chair, each for a one-year term.  Officers "hold-over" until their
replacements are elected.
      1. During the first regular council meeting of each year, the acting
council chair at the beginning of the meeting is the council chair from the
prior year or, in the alternative, the council vice-chair from the prior year;
otherwise, a council member appointed by a majority vote of the council.
      2.  During the first regular council meeting of each year thereafter, the
newly elected council chair may immediately act as council chair for the
remainder of the meeting.
  C.  All council members are eligible to be candidates for council chair or
council vice-chair,
1. A council member may only serve as council chair for two (2) consecutive
years (and may not serve again without a break of one (1) year).
2. There are no term limits for serving as council vice-chair.
3. Election as council vice-chair does not mandate succession to the office of
council chair.
  D.  At the council meeting described above:
      1.  The council chair shall, in a manner materially similar to the
following:
        a.  Ask all the council members to declare if any of them choose to not
be considered for the position of council chair;
        b.  Ask all the council members to declare if they choose to be
considered for the position of council chair;
        c.  State that the declarations are closed and restate the names of
those who are not declared, which shall include those affected by term limits
and those who chose to not be considered;
        d.  Restate the names of the other council members, all of whom are
deemed to be declared ("candidates");
        e.  Direct the council office director to deliver a "closed ballot"
(which may be in paper, electronic, or other form) to each council member, so
that each council member may indicate on the closed ballot the candidate for
whom the council member's vote is cast;
        f.  Direct the council office director to tally the closed ballot votes
and to announce the number of votes for each candidate (in a manner that does
not disclose which council members voted for which candidates);
        g.  Utilize the "run-off" procedures in subsection D2, if necessary;
and
        h.  Declare the candidate receiving a "majority vote" of the council
(at least four (4) votes) to be duly elected as the council chair.
      2.  If no candidate received a majority vote, then the two (2) candidates
with the highest number of votes shall be voted upon in a "run-off," using the
same type of closed ballot vote. A coin or a 6-sided die may be used, at the
direction of the current council chair, to reduce the number of candidates to
two (2), in the event of a tie preventing the occurrence of only two (2) final
candidates.  For example, in the initial vote, there are three (3) candidates
and the roll call votes cast are three (3) for council member A, two (2) for
council member B, and two for council member C.  Council member A is
automatically in the run-off vote and the tie between the other two (2)
candidates is broken by a coin toss in favor of council member C.  A run-off
vote is then held, and council member A is elected by four (4) votes (compared
to three (3) votes for council member C).
      3.  The election of the council vice-chair shall then be held using the
process described above, except that the council member elected as council
chair shall not be eligible to be a candidate for council vice-chair.
  E.  The council, by resolution in a public meeting, may terminate the term of
the council chair or council vice-chair and may proceed to fill the vacancy for
the remainder of the year, as set forth herein.  The council may likewise fill
a vacancy that occurs due to change of residence, resignation, or any other
reason.
  F.  No additional oath of office or ceremony is required for the council
chair or council vice-chair.
  G.  The council chair shall occupy the center seat. Any acting council chair
may continue to occupy the regularly assigned seat. (Ord. 19-32, 10-23-2019,
Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)

items pertaining to council business. The council chair shall sign all other
documents on behalf of the council as a whole which are not otherwise
specifically delegated to someone other than the council chair by this chapter

the agenda for and conduct all meetings of the council as a whole, subject to
council rules.
  F.  In the absence of the council chair, or upon the council chair's
inability to function or at the council chair's direct request, the council
vice-chair shall be acting council chair and shall have and exercise all of the
powers and authority of the council chair.
  G.  In the event of the absence of the council chair and council vice-chair,
the council may appoint an acting council chair for a meeting. (Ord. 19-32, 10-
23-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
ATTACHMENT C
 
1-6-11: COUNCIL OFFICE AND COUNCIL STAFF:
  A.    The city council may appoint a Council Office Director. Subject to
budget constraints and council approval, the Council Office Director hires
part-time, or full-time, council staff positions. Council Office employees are
at-will employees under Utah Code 10-3-1105.
  B.  The City Council may establish terms of employment, job duties, and roles
for council staff. The City Council may delegate to the Council Office Director
authority to negotiate and execute written employment agreements, offer letters
and hiring documents on behalf of the City Council.
  C.  Employment offers shall be processed through the Human Resource office
and be consistent with City personnel policies and procedures in effect at the

policies and procedures. Council Office employees are supervised by the council
office director.

1-6-9: ELECTION OF COUNCIL CHAIR AND COUNCIL VICE-CHAIR:
   A.   The officers of the council shall be a council chair and a council
vice-chair.
   B.   At the first regular council meeting of each year (or after a vacancy
occurs), or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the council shall elect one
(1) of its members to be council chair and another one (1) of its members to be
council vice-chair, each for a one-year term.  Officers "hold-over" until their
replacements are elected.
      1.   For the first regular council meeting after January 6, 2020, and
until a replacement council chair is elected, the acting "hold-over" council
chair is the council member serving as "mayor pro tem" at the end of December,
2019, if said person is still a member of the council at said first meeting;
otherwise, the acting "hold-over" council chair shall be a council member
appointed by a majority vote of the council at the beginning of said first
council meeting.  During the first regular council meeting of each year
thereafter, the acting "hold-over" council chair at the beginning of the
meeting is the council chair from the prior year or, in the alternative, the
council vice-chair from the prior year; otherwise, a council member appointed
by a majority vote of the council.
      2.   During the first council meeting after January 6, 2020, and during
the first regular council meeting of each year thereafter, the newly elected
council chair may immediately act as council chair for the remainder of said
first council meeting.
   C.   All council members are eligible to be candidates for council chair or
council vice-chair, except that a council member may only serve up to two (2)
consecutive years (and may serve again after not being council chair for one
(1) year).  There are no term limits for serving as council vice-chair.  Prior
election to the office of council vice-chair does not mandate succession to the
office of council chair.
   D.   At the council meeting described above:
      1.   The council chair shall, in a manner materially similar to the
following:
         a.   Ask all the council members to declare if any of them choose to
not be considered for the position of council chair;
         b.   Ask all the council members to declare if they choose to be
considered for the position of council chair;
         c.   State that the declarations are closed and restate the names of
those who are not declared, which shall include those affected by term limits
and those who chose to not be considered;
         d.   Restate the names of the other council members, all of whom are
deemed to be declared ("candidates");
         e.   Direct the council office director to deliver a "closed ballot"
(which may be in paper, electronic, or other form) to each council member, so
that each council member may indicate on the closed ballot the candidate for
whom the council member's vote is cast;
         f.   Direct the council office director to tally the closed ballot
votes and to announce the number of votes for each candidate (in a manner that
does not disclose which council members voted for which candidates);
         g.   Utilize the "run-off" procedures in subsection D2, if necessary;
and
         h.   Declare the candidate receiving a "majority vote" of the council
(at least four (4) votes) to be duly elected as the council chair.
      2.   If no candidate received a majority vote, then the two (2)
candidates with the highest number of votes shall be voted upon in a "run-off,"
using the same type of closed ballot vote.  A coin or a 6-sided die may be
used, at the direction of the current council chair, to reduce the number of
candidates to two (2), in the event of a tie preventing the occurrence of only
two (2) final candidates.  For example, in the initial vote, there are three
(3) candidates and the roll call votes cast are three (3) for council member A,
two (2) for council member B, and two for council member C.  Council member A
is automatically in the run-off vote and the tie between the other two (2)
candidates is broken by a coin toss in favor of council member C.  A run-off
vote is then held, and council member A is elected by four (4) votes (compared
to three (3) votes for council member C).
      3.   The election of the council vice-chair shall then be held using the
process described above, except that the council member elected as council
chair shall not be eligible to be a candidate for council vice-chair.
   E.   The council, by resolution in a public meeting, may terminate the term
of the council chair or council vice-chair and may proceed to fill the vacancy
for the remainder of the year, as set forth herein.  The council may likewise
fill a vacancy that occurs due to change of residence, resignation, or any
other reason.
   F.   No additional oath of office or ceremony is required for the council
chair or council vice-chair.
   G.   The council chair shall occupy the center seat.  Any acting council
chair may continue to occupy the regularly assigned seat.  (Ord. 19-32, 10-23-
2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)

inability to function or at the council chair's direct request, the council
vice-chair shall be acting council chair and shall have and exercise all of the
powers and authority of the council chair.
   G.   In the event of the absence of the council chair and council vice-

1-6-11: COUNCIL OFFICE AND COUNCIL STAFF:

may appoint a council office director and other part-time, full-time, or
contract council staff positions as prescribed by this chapter. All such

   B.   The city council may establish terms of employment, including job

The conduct related duties of the elected officials, and violations thereof,
include, but are not limited to, the following duties and violations:
   A.   Request for Inappropriate Relief From Enforcement Action: The elected
officials shall never use or attempt to use their positions to request or
obtain inappropriate relief from enforcement action taken by police or law
enforcement personnel or other government personnel, whether local, state, or
federal; doing so constitutes a violation.
   B.   Unauthorized Exercise of Authority (Including Judicial or

state, and federal law. They shall never assume or exercise authority (or
attempt to exercise authority) beyond that which is allowed by city ordinances

   C.   Attendance at Regular City Council Meetings: There are approximately
twenty four (24) regular council meetings (excluding any "strategic planning
meeting") listed on the "notice of annual meeting schedule" for each calendar
year. If an elected official misses three (3) or more consecutive regular
council meetings in a calendar year, then this constitutes a violation and said
elected official:
      1.   May receive a fine in the amount of seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00) per consecutive missed regular council meeting in excess of two (2)
consecutive missed meetings; unless:
         a.   The council, in an open meeting, removes some or all of this fine
(with said elected official abstaining, to avoid a conflict of interest).
   D.   Contact Information Provided to The City Recorder and Council Office
Director: The elected officials:
      1.   Shall each provide a current residential street address, at least
one current (functioning) phone number, and at least one current (functioning)
e-mail address to the city recorder and council office director; and

city recorder and council office director within fourteen (14) calendar days of
the change; and
      3.   Shall each make reasonable efforts to be available and to respond to
other city officials, officers, and employees, and to complete other duties and
assignments.
Failure to provide this information constitutes a violation.
   E.   Personal Expenditures of City Funds: With regards to all personal
expenditures of City funds, the elected officials shall comply with city
reimbursement and    financial policies, as stated in the employee handbook
and/or other applicable rules and guidelines. Failure to do so constitutes a
violation.
   F.   Crimes of Dishonesty, Moral Turpitude, Disorderly Conduct, and Similar
Thereto: If an elected official is charged in a court of law with a crime(s) of
dishonesty, moral turpitude (including sex related crimes), disorderly conduct,
domestic violence, other violence, DUI (driving under the influence), DUI-
metabolite, leaving the scene of an accident, failure to cooperate with law
enforcement personnel, or a similar crime(s), then:
      1.   The city council, in order to avoid interference with the judicial
process, shall not make a public statement, or take any action regarding the
criminal charge(s), unless said charged elected official is found guilty in a
court of law (which constitutes a violation); and
      2.   An elected official, or an appropriate individual(s), may request
one or more of the remedies in subsections
1-11A-5B, C, and D of this article, if a charged elected official is found
guilty in a court of law.
   G.   Crime of "Official Neglect and Misconduct": According to section 10-3-
826, Utah Code Annotated, if an elected official willfully fails to perform a
duty required by city ordinances and rules or state statutes, or is willfully
involved in misfeasance or malfeasance in office, then this constitutes a
violation and said elected official may be prosecuted for a misdemeanor and may
be removed from office. If such allegations exist, an elected official, or an
appropriate individual(s), may request one or more of the remedies in
subsections
1-11A-5A, B, C, and D of this article. (Ord. 16-38, 9-7-2016; amd. Ord. 18-34,

for another, a gift of value or economic benefit tantamount to a gift, as
defined by state statute (and sections
1-11-1 to 1-11-22 of this title inclusive):
         a.   That would tend improperly to influence a reasonable person in
the elected official's position to depart from the faithful and impartial
discharge of the person's public duty; or
         b.   That the elected official knows or that a reasonable person in
that position should know under the circumstances is primarily for the purpose
of rewarding the elected official for official action taken; and
      4.   Make public disclosures and filings, including where an elected
official receives compensation for assisting any person or business entity in
any transaction involving the city; or where an elected official has a business
ownership interest, personal interest, investment, or other financial benefit
which creates a conflict between the elected official's personal interests and
the elected official's public duties. (Ord. 16-38, 9-7-2016; amd. Ord. 16-47,

Annotated, if there are allegations of "high crimes and misdemeanors or

official at a regular public meeting of the city council; and

or pattern of abuse by the named elected official, and any economic or other
benefit received by the named elected official. As per section 10-3-826, Utah

1-13-6: VOTING BY CITY COUNCIL:
   A.   The minimum number of members of the City Council necessary to

   B.   A roll call vote shall be taken and recorded for all ordinances,
resolutions and any action which would create a liability against the City and
in any other case at the request of any member of the City Council by a "yes"
or a "no" vote and shall be recorded. Every resolution or ordinance shall be in
writing before the vote is taken.
   C.   The minimum number of "yes" votes required to pass any ordinance,
resolution or take any final action by the City Council shall never be less
than four (4). A two-thirds (2/3) vote, where required by law, requires five
(5) affirmative votes. These requirements concerning a minimum number of votes
shall apply only to actions where final official action is to be taken by the
City Council in its official legislative capacity; the requirements concerning
a minimum number of votes shall not apply to preliminary and procedural matters
or issues of a nondispositive nature, including, but not limited to, motions to
recess or adjourn (whether or not a quorum is present), motions concerning
issues of parliamentary procedure, motions to make technical changes in written
proposals before the City Council, and similar motions, which may be decided by
a majority of the quorum voting. A motion to take final action on an issue
before the City Council shall not be deemed to be defeated by reason of the
failure to obtain the minimum number of affirmative votes for such final
action. Final action on such an issue shall be postponed until the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council if at least a majority of the
members voting voted affirmatively for the motion; however, if the number of
votes against the motion would be sufficient (assuming that the number of
against votes would remain unchanged) to defeat the proposal even if a greater
number of affirmative votes were obtained, such issue shall not be brought back
for reconsideration and revoting but shall be deemed to be defeated. Unless
otherwise directed by at least four (4) members of the City Council, the
Council Chair shall cause eligible issues to be placed on the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the City Council for reconsideration and revoting. Nothing
in this subsection shall prevent the City Council from reconsidering any motion
or other issue previously acted upon.
   D.   Any ordinance, resolution or motion of the City Council having fewer
favorable votes than required in this section shall be deemed defeated and
invalid, except a meeting may be adjourned to a specific time by a majority
vote of the City Council even though such majority is less than that required
in this section.
   E.   Any action taken by the City Council shall not be reconsidered or
rescinded at any special meeting unless the number of members of the City
Council present at the special meeting is equal to or greater than the number
of members present at the meeting when the action was approved. (2001 Code § 2-
8-107; 2009 Code § 1-13-7; amd. Ord. 09-13, 4-14-2009; Ord. 19-14, 3-27-2019)

                                    or Contractor") will only have standing if
                                    all following conditions are present:
 
 
           A. The bidder, offeror, or contractor that has suffered an injury or harm

           that is the subject of the protest.
           B. A decision on the protest in favor of the protestor is reasonably
           likely to redress the harm and would give the bidder, offeror, or
           contractor a reasonable likelihood of being awarded a contract or not
          terminating the contract. A subcontractor or potential subcontractor shall
           not have standing to protest or appeal a protest, or act as an agent of

3-1-3: GENERAL PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS:
The following general requirements applies to all purchases for goods and
services:
   A.   A requisition or purchase order for goods and services is required (in
advance) for all purchases that are (i) not paid for with a P-Card, (ii)
applied to an approved contract, or (iii) listed as a disbursement.
Requirements related to requisitions are listed as follows:
      1.   Content of Requisition: The requisition submitted to the purchasing
manager must contain the following, if applicable:
         a.   The program and account numbers.
         b.   The quantity, description, specifications, and scope of work.
         c.   All quotes and supporting documentation.
         d.   Department head or designee financial system workflow approval.
         e.   Email addresses of known potential suppliers.
      2.   Supporting Documentation: The supporting documentation attached to
the requisition shall be submitted and recorded as follows:
         a.   If the purchase amount is less than seven thousand five hundred
($7,500), attach the supporting vendor quote documentation in the requisition.
         b.   Specifications and requirements are sent to the purchasing
manager or designee to initiate a procurement process. After the procurement
process has resulted in an award, the requesting department will enter a
requisition with the supporting documentation provided by the purchasing
manager for processing.
      3.   Approval: Requisitions are approved through the financial systems
approval workflow process.
   B.   Unless otherwise exempted, all purchases over two thousand dollars
($2,000) require competitive solicitation as defined in this chapter.
   C.   Purchases that have been divided into two or more smaller purchases to
avoid using a standard procurement process are prohibited.
   D.   Purchases that have been made without a requisition or purchase order
("after-the-fact" purchases), are considered non-compliant with the city's
purchasing policies. Employees failing to comply with this policy may be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   E.   For any purchase using federal funding, the contractors must be checked
to ensure they have not been excluded from providing goods and services for
federal award programs by checking the www.sam.gov/SAM website.
   F.   All elected officials, city officers, and employees who use a P-Card
must submit to the purchasing manager on a monthly basis all receipts,
supporting documentation, and account funding information pursuant to their
respective purchasing card agreement.
   G.   When determining the proper level of procurement authority for a given
purchase or whether competitive solicitation is required pursuant to this
chapter, the length of the contract, including all potential renewal terms,
shall be considered for purposes of calculating the total estimated price of
the procurement of goods or services. For example, pursuant to the required
thresholds below, if the purchasing manager estimates that the purchase of a
particular good or service is expected to have a value of twenty thousand
dollars ($20,000) annually for a contractual term of one (1) year with the
option to renew for an additional four (4) one-year terms, the value of the
contract would be one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and not twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000). Therefore, in this example, competitive
solicitation would be required.
   H.   The mayor, purchasing manager, or their respective designees may allow
others to assist in the preparation of specifications for the city's use in
making procurements, provided there is no conflict of interest involved.
   I.   The city reserves the right to reject or cancel any or all invitation
for bids, request for proposals, request for quotations or other solicitation.
The city, in its sole discretion, may waive any informality, immaterial error,
minor technicality, or other irregularity of any procurement processes or
procedures if doing so would be in the best interest of the city, as determined
by the mayor or purchasing manager. (Ord. 19-54, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12
noon on January 6, 2020)
3-1-4: PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY:
   A.   Purchases Under Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars: The purchasing manager or
designee shall have the authority to purchase goods and services where the
total estimated value is less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
   B.   Purchases for Building Improvements: The public works department head
or designee shall be authorized to purchase necessary goods and services

fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).

This chapter is intended to meet the requirements of Utah Code Annotated
section 11-36a-101 et seq., titled the impact fees act. The intent of
collecting impact fees is to impose a portion of the cost of capital
improvements upon those developments that create the need for, or increase the
demands on, such capital improvements, as follows:
   A.   Water rights and water supply, treatment, storage, and distribution
facilities;
   B.   Wastewater collection and treatment facilities;
   C.   Stormwater, drainage, and flood control facilities;
   D.   Roadway facilities;
   E.   Parks, recreation facilities, open space, and trails;
   F.   Public safety facilities, including law enforcement, fire and emergency
medical facilities; or
   G.   Environmental mitigation as provided in Utah code section 11-36a-205.
The impact fees imposed by this chapter are separate from and in addition to
any applicable tax, special assessment, charge or fee otherwise provided by law
or imposed as a condition of development. (2001 Code § 89-8-101; amd. Ord. 13-
28, 7-31-2013; Ord. 16-48, 11-16-2016)
3-7-2: IMPACT FEE FACILITIES PLAN:
The city council shall adopt and the city shall maintain an impact fee
facilities plan.
   A.   An impact fee facilities plan shall:
      1.   Identify the existing level of service;
      2.   Subject to subsection C of this section, establish a proposed level
of service;
      3.   Identify any excess capacity to accommodate future growth at the
proposed level of service;
      4.   Identify demands placed upon existing public facilities by new
development activity at the proposed level of service; and
      5.   Identify the means by which the political subdivision or private
entity will meet those growth demands.
   B.   A proposed level of service may diminish or equal the existing level of
service.
   C.   A proposed level of service may:
      1.   Exceed the existing level of service if, independent of the use of
impact fees, the city provides, implements, and maintains the means to increase
the existing level of service for existing demand within six (6) years of the
date on which new growth is charged for the proposed level of service; or
3-7-2   3-7-3
      2.   Establish a new public facility if, independent of the use of impact
fees, the political subdivision or private entity provides, implements, and
maintains the means to increase the existing level of service for existing
demand within six (6) years of the date on which new growth is charged for the
proposed level of service.
   D.   The city may only impose impact fees on development activities when the
city's plan for financing system improvements establishes that impact fees are
necessary to achieve an equitable allocation to the costs borne in the past and
to be borne in the future, in comparison to the benefits already received and
yet to be received, and to maintain a proposed level of service that complies
with subsections B and C of this section. (2001 Code § 89-8-102; amd. Ord. 13-
28, 7-31-2013)
3-7-3: IMPACT FEE ANALYSIS:
   A.   An impact fee analysis shall be performed for each impact fee proposed
to be collected. The impact fee analysis shall:
      1.   Identify the anticipated impact on or consumption of any existing
capacity of a public facility by the anticipated development activity;
      2.   Identify the anticipated impact on system improvements required by
the anticipated development activity to maintain the established level of
service for each public facility;
      3.   Subject to subsection A2 of this section, demonstrate how the
anticipated impacts described in subsections A1 and A2 of this section, are
reasonably related to the anticipated development activity;
      4.   Estimate the proportionate share of:
         a.   The costs for existing capacity that will be recouped; and
         b.   The costs of impacts on system improvements that are reasonably
related to the new development activity; and
      5.   Based on the requirements of this chapter, identify how the impact
fee was calculated.
   B.   In analyzing whether or not the proportionate share of the costs of
public facilities are reasonably related to the new development activity, the
local political subdivision or private entity, as the case may be, shall
identify, if applicable:
      1.   The cost of each existing public facility that has excess capacity
to serve the anticipated development resulting from the new development
activity;
      2.   The cost of system improvements for each public facility;
      3.   Other than impact fees, the manner of financing for each public
facility, such as user charges, special assessments, bonded indebtedness,
general taxes, or federal grants;
      4.   The relative extent to which development activity will contribute to
financing the excess capacity of and system improvements for each existing
public facility, by such means as user charges, special assessments, or payment
from the proceeds of general taxes;
      5.   The relative extent to which development activity will contribute to
the cost of existing public facilities and system improvements in the future;
      6.   The extent to which the development activity is entitled to a credit
against impact fees because the development activity will dedicate system
improvements or public facilities that will offset the demand for system
improvements, inside or outside the proposed development;
      7.   Extraordinary costs, if any, in servicing the newly developed
properties; and
      8.   The time-price differential inherent in fair comparisons of amounts
paid at different times. (2001 Code § 89-8-103; amd. Ord. 13-28, 7-31-2013)
3-7-4: NOTICE:
   A.   Notice of Intent to Prepare an Impact Fee Facilities Plan:

      1.   Determining the types of capital facilities impacted by the
development activity;
      2.   Verifying the applicable unit of measure for the development;
      3.   Verifying the applicable impact fee coefficient for each capital
facility impacted by the development;
      4.   Determining the number of units of measure applicable to the
particular development; and
      5.   For each capital facility impacted by the development, multiplying
the applicable impact fee coefficient by the number of units of measure.
   C.   Mixed Uses: If the development for which a building permit or
subdivision plat is sought contains a mix of uses, the city must separately
calculate the impact fee due for each type of development.
   D.   Nonbinding Estimate: Prior to making an application for a building
permit, an applicant may request a nonbinding impact fee estimate from the
city, which shall base such estimate on the development potential of the
particular site and through the same manner as provided in this section.
   E.   Review; Modifications: The city shall, in conjunction with the annual
capital budget and capital improvements planning processes, review the
development potential of each development and the impact fee facilities plan

CHAPTER 8
CITY FINANCIAL REPORTING AND BUDGET PROCESS
SECTION:
3-8-1: City Budget Process
3-8-2: Property Taxes
3-8-1: CITY BUDGET PROCESS:
Annual budgets are prepared and adopted in accordance with the Uniform Fiscal
Procedures Act adopted by the state of Utah. Once a budget has been adopted, it
remains in effect until it has been formally revised. Furthermore, in
accordance with state law, all appropriations lapse at the end of the budget
year. If any obligations are contracted for and are in excess of the adopted
budget, they are not a valid or enforceable claim against the city. Budgets are
adopted on a basis consistent with GAAP, and all funds have legally adopted
budgets.
The city adheres to the following procedures in establishing the budgetary data
reflected in the financial statements:
   A.   Prior to or on the first council meeting in May, the mayor submits to
the city council a proposed operating budget for the fiscal year commencing the
following July 1st. The operating budget includes proposed expenditures and the
proposed sources of revenues.
   B.   Between the date of the council's receipt of the proposed budget from
the mayor and June 30th, the council reviews and adjusts the mayor's proposed
budget. On or before June 30th, a public hearing is held and the budget is
legally adopted through passage of a resolution.
   C.   After the budget is adopted, the finance director may transfer any
unencumbered or unexpended appropriation amount from one expenditure account to
another within a department. The council may, by resolution, transfer any
unencumbered or unexpended appropriation amount from one department in a fund
to another department within the same fund. Other budget amendments occur
throughout the year as deemed necessary with council approval following a
public hearing.
   D.   The budget is used as a management control device during the year for
the general fund, special revenue funds, and capital projects fund. In the
general fund, budgets are adopted at the functional level and budgetary control
is exercised at the departmental level. For special revenue funds, budgets are
adopted and control is exercised at the level of total expenditures for each
individual fund.
   E.   Annual budgets for the general fund, capital projects fund, and all
special revenue funds are prepared on the modified-accrual method of accounting
and legally adopted by the council.
   F.   Encumbrances (commitments related to unpaid purchase orders or
contracts for goods or services) are used only as an internal management
control device during the year. All outstanding encumbrances lapse at fiscal
year end.  However, some encumbered amounts are re-authorized and honored as
part of the following year's budget.
   G.   Although Utah State law requires the initial preparation of budgets for
all city funds (both governmental and proprietary), it only requires the
reporting of actual versus budget for governmental funds.  (Ord. 19-55, 12-11-
2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
3-8-2: PROPERTY TAXES:
The Salt Lake County treasurer acts as an agent for the city and collects and
distributes the city's property tax revenue. Utah state laws establish the
process by which taxes are levied and collected. The property tax calendar is
as follows:
   A.   By June 8, the city receives valuation, certified tax rate, and levy
worksheet forms via the state of Utah's certified tax rate website.
   B.   Before June 30, the city holds a public hearing and adopts a proposed
tax rate. This proposed tax rate is then submitted to the county auditor for
review via the website.
   C.   Before July 22 (if the city proposes a tax rate higher than the
certified tax rate), the county auditor mails a notice of intent to exceed the
certified tax rate to property owners. This notice is normally combined with
the tax notice.
   D.   By August 17, the city holds a public hearing and adopts the final tax
rate and certifies the tax rate with the county auditor.
   E.   Between August 8 and August 22, taxpayers may petition the county board
of equalization for an adjustment in the taxable value of their real property.
   F.   By November 1, the county auditor approves changes in taxable value of
the real property and the county treasurer mails tax notices with a due date of
November 30. Payments made after November 30 are considered delinquent and are
subject to a penalty.
   G.   Unless the delinquent taxes and penalties are paid before January 15, a
lien is attached to the real property, and the amount of taxes and penalties
bear interest from January 1 until paid. If after five years, delinquent taxes
have not been paid, the county sells the property at a tax sale.
For property taxes, at January 1 of each year (the assessment date), the city
has the legal right to collect the taxes and has recorded a receivable and a
corresponding deferred inflow of resources for the assessed amount of those
property taxes as of January 1 of each year. Most of the tax will not be
received until the following fiscal year.  (Ord. 19-55, 12-11-2019, Effective
at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
CHAPTER 9
SERVICE FEES
SECTION:
3-9-1: Service Fee For Returned Checks And Dishonored Credit Charges
3-9-1: SERVICE FEE FOR RETURNED CHECKS AND DISHONORED CREDIT CHARGES:
The city treasurer may assess and collect a service fee from the maker or
issuer of any check, debit card or credit card payable to the city when payment
is dishonored upon first presentment by the bank upon which it is drawn. The
service fee shall be the sum adopted by the city council in the city uniform
fee schedule. The assessment and collection of this fee shall not preclude the
initiation of appropriate civil or criminal proceedings against the issuer or
maker of the dishonored check. (2001 Code § 2-7-207; 2009 Code § 1-8G-7; amd.
Ord. 09-13, 4-14-2009; Ord. 19-55, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January

certification will run for forty eight (48) consecutive calendar months.

rata basis, for each quarter of a year for which the license was not in effect.
Any partial quarter or three (3) month period of the license year in which the
initial license was granted shall be counted as a period for which full pro
rata payment is required. This pro rata payment shall be administered so that a
license applicant shall pay a percentage of the annual license fee periodically
established in the city council uniform fee schedule, computed on a license
year quarter, as follows:
         a.   One hundred percent (100%) for a license issued in the first
three (3) calendar months of the initial license year;
         b.   Seventy five percent (75%) for a license issued in the second
three (3) calendar months of the initial license year;
         c.   Fifty percent (50%) for a license issued in the third three (3)
calendar months of the initial license year; and
         d.   Twenty five percent (25%) for a license issued in the fourth
three (3) calendar months of the initial license year.
      4.   Renewal License Fee: Following the pro rata payment, renewal license
fees shall be for a full twelve (12) month license year period.
   C.   Payments: Each license fee shall be paid at the time of an

discretion after having inspected the home occupation in response to complaints
from surrounding property owners. (Ord. 17-36, 6-28-2017)

CONTAMINATED SOILS
SECTION:
5-2-1: Scope
5-2-2: Applications For Development And Land Disturbance
5-2-3: Contaminated Soil Stabilization Projects
5-2-4: Voluntary Cleanup Projects
5-2-5: Permit Required Prior To Any Soil Disturbance
5-2-6: Prohibited Discharges
5-2-7: Alternative Compliance
5-2-1: SCOPE:
The provisions of this title and this chapter are intended to provide
substantive environmental study and compliance requirements for all actions,
property developments and land disturbances governed by this code, subject only
to express exemptions from regulation contained in this code. This chapter is
especially pertinent to applications for ground disturbance and/or for land
development under titles 9, 10, 11, 13 and/or 14 of this code. (2001 Code § 42-
1-101)
5-2-2: APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND LAND DISTURBANCE:
   A.   A phase I environmental assessment is required as part of any real
property related development or soil disturbance application submitted to the
city under title 9, 10, 11, 13 or 14 of this code. If a phase I environmental
study or other reliable information indicates the possible existence of
contaminated soils, the developer or land disturber shall make "all appropriate
inquiries", as required under the comprehensive environmental response,
compensation and liability act (CERCLA). The results of all studies and tests
shall be provided to the city and to the state department of environmental
quality (UDEQ) as they become available. Based on the information provided to
UDEQ, UDEQ will determine with the applicant whether the proposed development
or soil disturbance will proceed as a contaminated soil stabilization project
or as a voluntary cleanup project.
   B.   After considering the size, location and history of the real property
to which the development or soil disturbance application relates, the city
engineer may determine in his/her sole discretion to accept the application
without a phase 1 environmental assessment. Except for good cause, as
determined by the city engineer, a phase 1 environmental assessment will not be
required for the following development applications:
      1.   Lot line adjustments;
      2.   Amended plats;
      3.   Minor subdivisions;
      4.   Condo conversions. (2001 Code § 42-1-102; amd. Ord. 13-17, 4-24-
2013)
5-2-3: CONTAMINATED SOIL STABILIZATION PROJECTS:
   A.   If the testing or other reliable information indicates the presence of
contaminated soil, and UDEQ concludes that such soils can be stabilized in
place as part of the development project, as a prerequisite to receiving
initial development approval from the city, the developer shall contact UDEQ,
and shall provide written notice to the city that a UDEQ prescribed "necessary
steps" plan for contaminated soil stabilization will be undertaken and
completed by the developer during and as part of the development construction.
Prior to receiving final occupancy or development use approval from the city
for the project:
      1.   If the developer is a public or quasi-public entity, the developer
shall provide a signed letter from its senior managing official to the city
confirming that all "necessary steps" prescribed by UDEQ have been followed and
that the contaminated soils were effectively and appropriately contained in
place.
      2.   If the developer is a private person or entity, the developer shall
provide a signed letter to the city from a qualified and licensed environmental
engineer confirming that all "necessary steps" prescribed by UDEQ have been
followed and that the contaminated soils were effectively and appropriately
contained in place.
   B.   If at any time during the construction process new environmental
information is discovered concerning the level of contamination of the
development project soils, such information shall be timely reported to the
city and to UDEQ. UDEQ may require that a project begun as a stabilization
project thereafter proceed as a voluntary cleanup project. (2001 Code § 42-1-
102)
5-2-4: VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROJECTS:
If the testing or other reliable information indicates the presence of
contaminated soil, and UDEQ concludes that such soils cannot be stabilized in
place and must be remediated as part of the development project, as a
prerequisite to receiving initial development approval from the city, the
developer shall contact UDEQ, and shall develop and complete a UDEQ prescribed
voluntary cleanup plan for contaminated soil remediation. Prior to receiving
final occupancy or development use approval from the city for the project, the
developer shall submit to the city a state certificate of completion pursuant
to Utah Code Annotated section 19-8-101 et seq., and any amendments thereto.
(2001 Code § 42-1-102)
5-2-5: PERMIT REQUIRED PRIOR TO ANY SOIL DISTURBANCE:
Prior to commencing a stabilization plan or a voluntary cleanup plan under this
chapter, the developer must obtain any needed soil disturbance permit as
provided in title 9, 10, 11, 13 or 14 of this code. (2001 Code § 42-1-102)
5-2-6: PROHIBITED DISCHARGES:
No person shall discharge or permit the discharge of any regulated substances
or petroleum products, whether treated or untreated, to soils, air, groundwater
or surface water in any recharge area or protection zone that may have a
deleterious effect upon the groundwater in the city, unless the discharge
complies with federal, state and local regulations. (2001 Code § 89-4-708; amd.
2009 Code)
5-2-7: ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE:
   A.   Contaminated soil stabilization plans required in section
5-2-3 of this chapter and voluntary cleanup plans required in section
5-2-4 of this chapter can be undertaken under the auspices of the United States
environmental protection agency or another federal or Utah state agency rather
than UDEQ, if approved by the city engineer; and can be in connection with a
prior environmental investigation, order or other action.
   B.   Contaminated soil stabilization plans other than, but substantially
equivalent to, a UDEQ "necessary steps" plan will be deemed to meet the
requirements of section
5-2-3 of this chapter if approved by the city engineer, and if substantially
equivalent certification, for example an EPA no further action letter, is
presented to the city as required by subsections
5-2-3A1 and A2 of this chapter.
   C.   Contaminated soil cleanup programs prescribed by a federal or state
agency other than, but substantially equivalent to, a UDEQ prescribed voluntary
cleanup plan will be deemed to meet the requirements of section
5-2-4 of this chapter if approved by the city engineer, and if substantially
equivalent certification, for example an EPA no further action letter, is
presented to the city as required by section
5-2-4 of this chapter as determined by the city engineer. (Ord. 09-17, 6-9-
2009)
CHAPTER 3
NUISANCES
SECTION:
5-3-1: Nuisance Defined And Prohibited
5-3-2: Exempted Activities
5-3-3: Action For Abatement Of A Nuisance
5-3-1: NUISANCE DEFINED AND PROHIBITED:
   A.   Nuisance Defined: A "nuisance" is:
      1.   Any item, thing, manner or condition whatsoever that is dangerous to
human life or health or general welfare, or renders soil, air, water or food
impure or unwholesome;
      2.   A crime against the good order and economy of the State and consists
in unlawfully doing any act or omitting to perform any duty, which act or
omission does one of the following:
         a.   Annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health or
safety of three (3) or more persons;
         b.   Offends public decency;
         c.   Unlawfully interferes with, obstructs or tends to obstruct, or
renders dangerous for passage, any lake, stream, canal or basin, or any public
park, square, street or highway; or
         d.   In any way renders three (3) or more persons insecure in life or
the use of property;
      3.   Placing the carcass of any dead animal, or the offal from any
slaughter pen, corral or butcher shop into any river, creek, pond, street,
alley or public highway, or road in common use, or the attempt to destroy such
carcass or offal by fire, within the City limits;
      4.   Constructing or maintaining a corral, sheep pen, goat pen, stable,
pigpen, chicken coop, or other offensive yard or outhouse, where the waste or
drainage shall flow directly or indirectly into the waters of any stream, well,
or spring of water used for domestic purposes;
      5.   Depositing, piling, unloading or leaving any manure heap, offensive
rubbish or the carcass of any dead animal where the waste or drainage will flow
directly or indirectly into the waters of any stream, well or spring of water
used for domestic purposes;
      6.   Dipping or washing sheep in any stream, or constructing, maintaining
or using any pool or dipping vat for dipping or washing sheep in close
proximity to any stream or well used by the inhabitants of the City for
domestic purposes as to make the waters impure or unwholesome;
      7.   Constructing or maintaining any corral, yard or vat to be used for
the purpose of shearing or dipping sheep within the City limits, where the
refuse or filth from the corral or yard would naturally find its way into any
stream of water used by the inhabitants of the City for domestic purposes;
      8.   Establishing and maintaining any corral, camp or bedding place for
the purpose of herding, holding or keeping any cattle, horses, sheep, goats or
hogs within the City limits, where the refuse or filth from the corral, camp or
bedding place will naturally find its way into any stream of water or well used
by the inhabitants of the City for domestic purposes; or
      9.   Any injurious or noxious weeds, garbage, refuse, or unsightly or
deleterious objects.
         a.   For purpose of this chapter, "injurious weeds" shall mean plants
of any type growing in an uncultivated state, not used for food, fiber or
ornamentation, extending in height greater than twelve inches (12") above
ground, including, without limitation, tumbleweeds. The term "noxious weeds"
shall also include those plants listed as noxious weeds by the State
Commissioner of Agriculture pursuant to Utah Code Annotated section 4-17-103,
together with such plants later added to such list.
         b.   If a parcel of undeveloped ground is a size of five (5)
contiguous acres or larger, weed growth, other than noxious weeds, may be left
at a height higher than twelve inches (12") above ground if the property owner
maintains a defense strip of fifty feet (50') along every property line or
road/sidewalk edge surrounding the property.
         c.   Tumbleweeds are the result of various plants that have dried out
and been broken free of their roots and the soil by the wind. Tumbleweeds
present a distinct fire hazard that becomes greater as they dry out and
accumulate against structures such as fences, outbuildings, houses and
businesses. Property owners are expected to clear and remove tumbleweeds
originating on their property before they invade someone else's property.
         d.   A "defense strip" as used in subsection A9b of this section means
an area of land that is bare earth. This means that weeds and other vegetative
growth has been cut down to the ground, hauled away, and herbicide has been
applied to kill all plant life down to the root. A defense strip will need
continuous attention during the growing season.
   B.   Prohibition And Penalty: Nuisances are prohibited in and around the
City. Any person, whether as owner, agent or occupant, who creates, aids in
creating, tolerates or contributes to a nuisance, or who supports, continues or
retains a nuisance, is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor, and may be prosecuted
criminally or may be subject to administrative enforcement procedures provided
in title 16 of this Code.
   C.   Unequal Effect: An act which affects three (3) or more persons in any
of the ways specified in this section is still a nuisance regardless if the
extent of annoyance or damage inflicted on individuals is unequal.
   D.   General Applicability: The duties imposed upon landowners pursuant to
this section apply to all properties within the City. These provisions apply to
undeveloped or undivided parcels and to individual developed lots, including
the front yard, side yard or rear portion of any lots owned by such owner and
to, pursuant to Utah Code Annotated section 10-8-23, that area in front of the
property to the curb line of the street. (Ord. 13-08, 3-13-2013; amd. Ord. 15-
17, 7-22-2015; Ord. 19-10, 2-27-2019)
5-3-2: EXEMPTED ACTIVITIES:
The following activities are exempted from the definition of a nuisance and
will not be subject to City enforcement action:
   A.   Not A Nuisance: It is not a nuisance if the condition or animal
described in section
5-3-1 of this chapter:
      1.   Is merely the result of those naturally occurring noises made by
animals, including, but not limited to, mooing, bleating or crowing during
daytime hours; provided that the foregoing exemption does not apply to the
barking of dogs; and
      2.   The animal is lawfully kept on premises zoned for the keeping of
such animal pursuant to the provisions of this Code.
      3.   Owners of animals claiming this exemption are required to maintain
and control such animals in a responsible manner to prevent undue noise
disturbances during nighttime hours. All animals making noise, including, but
not limited to, dogs should, where possible, be confined in an enclosed
structure between the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:
00) A.M.
   B.   Preexisting Farms And Ranches: The definition of a "nuisance" shall not
apply to those properties and portions of properties engaged in active
agricultural/ranch operations continuously dating from before the surrounding
land was developed into the current residential or commercial uses. "Active
agricultural/ranch operations" includes, but is not limited to, sights, sounds,
odors, and dust inherent to raising crops, livestock, and livestock products.
Included in this exemption are weeds growing in areas of cultivated farm
properties which cannot be economically utilized for crop production.
   C.   Ditch Bank Protection: The definition of "nuisance" shall not apply to
weeds growing along active ditch banks, unless a traffic hazard or other danger
is presented by the growth of the weeds and so long as the weeds are maintained
below twelve inches (12") in height and are not noxious weeds. In this regard,
the City Council finds that weeds along active ditch banks are necessary to
preserve the stability of the ditch. (Ord. 13-08, 3-13-2013; amd. Ord. 15-17,
7-22-2015; Ord. 17-44, 7-26-2017)
5-3-3: ACTION FOR ABATEMENT OF A NUISANCE:
   A.   Authority: The officials identified in title 16 of this Code are
empowered to institute an action in the name of the City to abate a nuisance.
   B.   Judgment: If the existence of a "nuisance", as defined by section
5-3-1 of this chapter, is admitted or established, in an administrative, civil
or criminal proceeding, a judgment shall be entered which shall:
      1.   Permanently enjoin each defendant and any other person from further
maintaining the nuisance at the place complained of and each defendant from
maintaining such nuisance elsewhere;
      2.   Direct the person enjoined to surrender to the Sheriff of the county
in which the action was brought any material in his possession which is subject
to the injunction, and the Sheriff shall seize and destroy this material; and
      3.   Without proof of special injury, direct that an accounting be had
and all monies and other consideration paid as admission to view any motion
picture film determined to constitute a public nuisance or paid for any
publication determined to constitute a public nuisance, in either case without
deduction for expenses, be forfeited and paid into the General Fund of the
City.
   C.   Administrative Code Enforcement: As an alternative to commencing a
civil action, the City may commence administrative enforcement processes as
provided in title 16 of this Code.
   D.   Removal Of Nuisance:
      1.   If any owner or occupant of lands shall fail or neglect to
eradicate, destroy or remove weeds, garbage, refuse or objects upon the
premises after notice to do so, the City may employ necessary assistance and
cause such weeds, garbage, refuse or objects to be removed or destroyed. The
City shall prepare an itemized statement of all expenses incurred in the
removal and destruction and shall mail a copy to the owner demanding payment
within twenty (20) days of the date of mailing. This notice shall be deemed
delivered when mailed by certified mail addressed to the property owner's last
known address, or as otherwise allowed by title 16 of this Code. If the owner
fails to make payment of the amount set forth in the statement to the City
Treasurer within twenty (20) days, the inspector, on behalf of the City, may
cause suit to be brought in an appropriate court of law or may refer the matter
to the County Treasurer, as provided in this subsection and in title 16 of this
Code.
      2.   If collection of such costs are pursued through the courts, the City
may sue for and receive judgment upon all of such costs of removal and
destruction, together with reasonable attorney fees, interest and court costs.
The City may execute on such judgment in the manner provided by law.
      3.   If the City elects to refer the matter to the County Treasurer for
inclusion in the tax notice of the property owner, as provided by Utah Code
Annotated section 10-11-4, the City shall make, in triplicate, an itemized
statement of all expenses incurred in the removal and destruction of the
nuisance and shall deliver the three (3) copies of the statement to the County
Treasurer within ten (10) days after the completion of the work removing such
weeds, garbage, refuse or objects. (Ord. 13-08, 3-13-2013; amd. Ord. 15-17, 7-
22-2015; Ord. 19-10, 2-27-2019)

not contained within the solid waste container. For the collection and disposal
of solid residential waste from single-family residences for which there is no
direct access on a public street, the Chief Administrative Officer may make
such arrangements for the collection and disposal of such solid waste and the
charges as he deems appropriate; provided, that the daily service fee for such
collection and disposal shall not exceed that charged for a single-family

piped for at least twenty five percent (25%) of the linear distance two hundred
fifty feet (250') upstream from the proposed piping and two hundred fifty feet
(250') downstream from the proposed piping.
      2.   The developer, builder or property owner who is granted a temporary
exemption from the piping requirements shall pipe the ditch at least twenty
five percent (25%) of the adjoining ditch within the two hundred fifty foot
(250') distance is piped. For the purpose of determining the twenty five
percent (25%) limitation, the ditch shall be deemed to be piped if it has been
granted the temporary exemption under this section.

increased traffic demands or to address legitimate public safety concerns. The
city shall maintain those inverted siphons installed at those locations
designated by the city engineer.
   D.   Dedication of Improvements:  Irrigation improvements and facilities
shall be owned by the irrigation water users, who shall be thereafter
responsible for the operation, repair and maintenance thereof. (2001 Code § 89-
6-407; amd. 2009 Code)
   E.   Easements:  Easements necessary for the piping and maintenance of the
irrigation ditches shall be shown on the final subdivision plat, where
applicable. In cases where a ditch is removed from an existing easement to a
new location, the developer, builder or property owner shall convey to the
water users an easement, not less than five feet (5') on each side of the
centerline of the pipe, for the relocated and piped ditch.
   F.   Construction:
      1.   The city's construction manager shall invite the watermaster
responsible for the ditch or his designee to attend the preconstruction
conference, when applicable.
      2.   The developer, builder or property owner shall take such actions as
are necessary to avoid interference with the flow of water within the ditch
during the irrigation season.
      3.   Unused, abandoned irrigation or wastewater ditches may be filled in
if written approval is obtained from the persons having water rights within the
ditch. The written approval of the water users shall be obtained and presented
to the city engineer prior to final development approval. (2001 Code § 87-5-

owner shall provide a survey prepared by a licensed engineer or land surveyor
to verify that the structure is at an elevation which will allow for proper
drainage away from the structure and to an approved drainage facility. The
survey requirement may be waived by the building official or the city engineer
where compliance can be shown without conducting a survey.
      2.   New streets shall be so arranged as to allow for drainage to be
contained in and channeled through the streets in the event the storm drain
system fails, or its capacity is exceeded.
      3.   Slope easements shall be provided for new streets as necessary to
assure that failure of slopes or retaining structures will not adversely affect

at intersections and at seven hundred fifty foot (750') minimum intervals. A
California bearing ratio (CBR) test should be taken at each test pit location.
If a water table problem exists, provisions shall be made to control the water
to ensure dry basements. The city engineer may require a letter providing a
geo-technical report or a geologic report. Recommendations in the report shall
be incorporated into the road design.
   B.   Excavations and Fill Affecting Jordan River or Tributaries: 
Development and construction adjacent to the Jordan River or its natural
tributaries, or within any marsh or wetlands of the Jordan River, which will
result in any excavation or discharge of fill materials into the navigable
waters of the Jordan River shall require a permit from the U.S. army corps of
engineers prior to the issuance of local permits for excavation of material or
disposition of fill into any wetland or stream channel. Compliance with all
rules, regulations and conditions imposed by any agency having jurisdiction
over such channels, shall be a requirement of development approval, building
permit, and other city approvals and permits. (2001 Code § 89-6-412; amd. 2009

requirement of development approval, building permit issuance, and other city
approvals and permits involving construction. (2001 Code § 72-10-101; amd. 2009
Code; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-3A-2: SIDEWALKS:
   A.   Installation of Curb, Gutter and Sidewalk: High back curb, gutter and
sidewalk shall be required on both sides of streets. Where any part of a
subdivision is adjacent to or connects to an existing, paved city street that
has not been improved with curb, gutter, and sidewalks, the subdivider shall
install the appropriate curb, gutter, and sidewalk in the proper location for
the existing street and shall extend the asphalt paving to the curb and gutter
so installed. If there are no lots in the subdivision adjacent to an existing
paved street and the subdivider is installing a new street which connects to an
existing, paved city street that has not been improved with curb, gutter and
sidewalks, the subdivider shall extend curb and gutter on the new street around
the radius at the proper setback for the existing city street and shall
continue laying that same width of pavement to the existing pavement on the
city street to the outside end of the radius so installed.
   B.   Sidewalk Design Guidelines:
      1.   Sidewalks in and around subdivisions shall provide convenient
pedestrian access to transit stops along major arterial or collector streets.
      2.   Sidewalks shall be separated from the curb by a park strip along all

noon on January 6, 2020)
8-3A-3: MODIFICATIONS TO DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Modifications Authorized: If unique physical conditions affecting a
specific subdivision, development or building site are such that it is
impossible, or impractical or undesirable for the developer, builder or
property owner to fully comply with the design standards and policies contained
herein, the city engineer may recommend reasonable modifications to such
standards and policies for the specific subdivision, development or building
site.
   B.   Request for Modification: Requests for modifications shall be submitted
concurrently with the application for development approval or building permit.
The request shall clearly state the limitations that apply to the property and
identify the specific standards to be considered.
   C.   Criteria: Prior to making recommendations for modifications to the
design standards and policies, the planning commission shall find that:
      1.   The size, shape, topography, soil or subsurface conditions of the
subject property do not affect other properties in the general vicinity;
      2.   Strict application of design standards and policies to the property
will significantly limit the use and development of the property when compared
to similar properties in the general vicinity;
      3.   Granting of the modification will not be detrimental to public
safety and welfare, or injurious to other property in the general vicinity; and
      4.   The modification is consistent with the spirit and purpose of this
title.
   D.   City Council Action: The planning commission's recommendations for
modification of design standards and/or policies shall be forwarded to the city
council for final action. (2001 Code § 87-5-117; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 19-48,

8-3B-1: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this article is to require contribution toward
development costs by those benefiting therefrom and establish a method of
fairly allocating proportionate costs of public improvements, including project
improvements and system improvements associated with real estate development.
Nothing in this article applies to, or contravenes in any way, the requirements
found in chapter 2 of this title concerning the required undergrounding of
public utilities' facilities.
   B.   Policy: It shall be the policy of the city that, as a condition of
development approval, each developer should pay a reasonable share of the costs
of public improvements that are roughly proportionate to the impact of the
development. Such proportionate share is to be determined in a fair and
equitable manner. This policy may be implemented through the use of fees,
dedication of real property, dedication of improvements, reimbursements, or any
other lawful method. (2001 Code § 87-5-201; amd. Ord. 13-02, 2-13-2013)
8-3B-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this article, the words set forth below shall have the
following meanings:
APPLICANT: A developer who has submitted an application requesting that the
city enter into a reimbursement agreement or deferred improvement agreement.
CFP: The West Jordan capital facilities plan.
CAPITAL PROJECTS STRATEGIC PLAN: The West Jordan document indicating capital
facilities projects planned over a six (6) year period, taken from the CFP.
DEFERRED IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT: An agreement for deferred improvements.
DEFERRED IMPROVEMENTS: Improvements for which construction is deferred
according to a deferred improvement agreement entered into pursuant to the
provisions of this article.
ELIGIBLE PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Improvements that are off site or oversized improvements meeting all of
the following criteria:
      1.   They are required as a condition of development approval; and
      2.   They are anticipated to serve future development; and
      3.   They are off site or will create additional or excess capacity
beyond the proportionate share necessary to serve the proposed development at
the city's adopted level of service standards; and
      4.   They are approved by the city in advance of development in
accordance with the city's ordinances, rules, regulations, engineering
standards and specifications.
   B.   May include "system improvements", as defined in this section, but
shall not include "project improvements", as defined in this section, except to
the extent that the project improvements are extended off site and/or are
oversized to create additional or excess capacity beyond the proportionate
share necessary to service the proposed development at the city's adopted level
of service standards.
PROJECT IMPROVEMENTS: On site improvements that are planned and designed to
provide service for a development and that are necessary for the use and
convenience of the occupants or users of the development. The determination of
what constitutes "project improvements" will vary somewhat depending on the
specific facts and circumstances presented by the nature, size and scope of any
particular development. "Project improvements" are not "system improvements",
as defined in this section.
REIMBURSEMENT COST ALLOCATIONS: Costs that are allocated to and paid by
property owners or developers of properties that are deemed benefited
properties and are subject to a reimbursement agreement.
SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Existing public facilities that are designed to provide services within
the city to the community at large; or
   B.   Future public facilities identified in the city capital facilities plan
(CFP) that are intended to provide services within the city to the community at
large; and
   C.   Are not project improvements. (2001 Code § 87-5-202; amd. Ord. 13-02,
2-13-2013)
8-3B-3: RESPONSIBILITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT COSTS:
   A.   As a condition of development approval, a developer shall be required
to install public improvements which are reasonably necessary to serve the
proposed development at adopted level of service standards. Where required by
the city engineer to connect to existing public improvements with adequate
capacity, accommodate future development, or accommodate the CFP, the developer
shall also be required to either: 1) install off site or oversized public
improvements reasonably necessary to extend, expand or improve the city
infrastructure beyond that which is necessary to serve or benefit the
particular development; or 2) enter into a deferred improvement agreement
pursuant to the provisions of this article. Improvements specifically listed
but not yet built in the city capital facilities plan (CFP) may be constructed
by the developer out of the CFP planned sequence if such construction is
acceptable to the city and does not create unreasonable collateral hardships to
the infrastructure system.
   B.   All design costs, construction costs, installation costs, and the costs
of acquiring and dedicating real property and easements shall be paid by the
developer, at the developer's sole expense. (2001 Code § 87-5-203; amd. Ord.
13-02, 2-13-2013)
8-3B-4: REIMBURSEMENT FOR SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Authorized: Pursuant to this article, the developer may request a
reimbursement agreement for eligible public improvements specifically listed on
the city's capital projects strategic plan. The city administrator or designee
shall establish a priority for the CFP improvements, including, but not limited
to, determination of improvements to be included in the city's capital projects
strategic plan.
   B.   Impact Fees: Reimbursement for a system improvement may be made from
the impact fees collected and deposited in the city's impact fee account for
that type of improvement. The eligible costs for the improvement shall not
exceed the costs upon which the impact fees were established.
   C.   Expiration: The reimbursement for system improvements may continue
until such time as the cumulative reimbursement amount being collected as, and
paid from, impact fees reaches an amount equal to the maximum reimbursement for
said system improvements. No reimbursement shall be due or payable in excess of
the amount of impact fees available, after higher priority projects in the CFP
have been adequately funded. (2001 Code § 89-6-413; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 09-31,
10-14-2009; Ord. 13-02, 2-13-2013; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon
on January 6, 2020)
8-3B-5: REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT:
   A.   Request for Agreement: Any developer who intends to construct eligible
public improvements may submit an application requesting that the city enter
into a reimbursement agreement with the applicant for eligible public
improvements constructed and installed. Reimbursement will be available only
pursuant to a fully executed and effective reimbursement agreement. For
eligible public improvements that are system improvements, the developer shall
not be eligible to request a reimbursement agreement for improvements not on
the capital projects strategic plan.
   B.   Evaluation of Agreement: It shall be the policy of the city to evaluate
reimbursement agreements on a case by case basis, and develop a fair and
equitable method of allocating the proportionate share of the cost to all the
properties creating the need for or benefiting from the available public
improvements. It is anticipated that each situation will have its own unique
features and characteristics, and therefore each reimbursement agreement may
use one or more allocation methods, as appropriate and determined by the city,
in determining the proportionate share of the costs to be borne by the
properties which receive benefit from or create the need for the eligible
public improvements.
   C.   Contents of Agreement: The reimbursement agreement shall contain, at a
minimum, the following provisions:
      1.   Identification of the eligible public improvements that the
applicant agrees to construct;
      2.   Estimated cost of the eligible public improvements, including
acquisition of property and/or easements;
      3.   Maximum reimbursement to be made available to the applicant;
      4.   Maximum reimbursement to be made available to the applicant
specifically for the acquisition of property interests, easements or otherwise,
not to exceed one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of a city approved MAI
certified appraisal provided to the city at the applicant's expense;
      5.   Except for system improvements, identification of benefited
properties to which costs of the eligible public improvements will be
allocated;
      6.   Except for system improvements, allocation of costs and method of
assessment which may include, but is not limited to, frontage, zone, area, lot,
impervious area, number of connections, or any other fair and equitable
criteria;
      7.   Requirements for documentation, acceptable to the city attorney,
verifying actual costs of eligible public improvements;
      8.   Waiver and a covenant not to sue, which provision shall be in a form
acceptable to the city attorney;
      9.   No interest shall be paid on any amounts due under the agreement;
      10.   Requirements for modification of the agreement by written
amendment, executed by the parties to the agreement; and
      11.   The reimbursement agreement shall not confer a benefit upon any
third party, shall not be assigned, transferred or conveyed without the express
approval of the city, and shall be in a form approved by the city attorney.
   D.   Maximum Reimbursement:
      1.   The maximum amount of reimbursement shall be established by the
city, in the sole discretion of the city, and may be less than that requested
by the applicant.
      2.   No interest shall be included in the amount of the reimbursement,
and no interest shall be paid to the developer by the city or any other person
on amounts becoming due.
      3.   In no event shall reimbursement exceed the actual cost of eligible
public improvements.
      4.   The maximum reimbursement shall be as set forth in the reimbursement
agreement, or validly executed amendment, unless additional reimbursement is
approved by the city administrator according to this subsection D.
      5.   Upon verification by the city engineer of the actual cost of
satisfactorily completed eligible public improvements, the city engineer shall
recommend a reimbursement amount to the city administrator for those eligible
public improvements that are system improvements. The city administrator may:
a) approve reimbursement of the verified actual costs up to the amount of the
maximum reimbursement set forth in the reimbursement agreement; b) approve
reimbursement of the verified actual costs up to ten percent (10%) over the
maximum reimbursement set forth in the reimbursement agreement, provided that
the actual costs are determined by the city engineer to be reasonable; or c)
recommend to the city council approval or denial of an amendment to the
reimbursement agreement increasing the maximum reimbursement.
   E.   Collection from Benefited Properties: Reimbursement cost allocations
may only be collected from benefited properties that are identified in a fully
executed and effective reimbursement agreement. The appropriate amount shall be
requested upon development of the identified benefited property. This means in
concurrence with recording a subdivision plat or issuance of a building permit,
whichever occurs first.
   F.   Release from Liability for Payment: The city shall, in all cases, be
immune and not liable for any payments to the developer if a city reimbursement
ordinance or reimbursement agreement is determined by a court of law to be
illegal, unconstitutional, or otherwise unenforceable for any reason. (2001
Code § 87-5-205; Ord. 09-31, 10-14-2009; Ord. 13-02, 2-13-2013; Ord. 19-48, 12-
11- 2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)

   A.   Except reimbursement for system improvements as set forth in section
 8-3B-4 of this article, reimbursement agreements and public reimbursements
shall expire a maximum of ten (10) years after the effective date of the
agreement, or at such time as the cumulative reimbursement amount reaches the
maximum reimbursement, whichever event occurs first. No reimbursement shall be
due or payable after said ten (10) year period, unless permitted pursuant to
section
8-3B-4 of this article. (2001 Code § 87-5-207; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 12-19, 6-
27-2012; § 8-3B-7; Ord. 13-02, 2-13-2013; Ord. 16-03, 1-13-2016)
8-3B-7: COST ALLOCATION FOR NONSYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   In determining the appropriate reimbursement cost allocation for
eligible public improvements that are not system improvements, the city
administrator or designee shall consider the reasonable cost of the
improvements, including construction and land costs, and other expenses
directly related to the completion of the improvement. The city administrator
may also consider the expected useful life of the improvement, the necessity of
the improvement for development of the benefited parcels, prior contributions
by property owners, the proportionate benefit received by each parcel compared
to the benefit received by all parcels served by the public improvements, the
intensity of use of the improvements by each parcel served, and any other
factors that the city administrator deems fair and appropriate.
   B.   In no event shall the cumulative total of all reimbursement cost
allocations exceed the maximum amount of reimbursement set forth in the
reimbursement agreement or the actual cost of the eligible public improvements.
(2001 Code § 87-5-208; 2009 Code § 8-3B-8; amd. Ord. 13-02, 2-13-2013; Ord. 19-
48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-3B-8: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW:
In the event that a developer of a benefited property disagrees with the
reimbursement cost allocation to which the benefited property is subject, the
developer may challenge the method or amount of the reimbursement cost
allocation by submitting notice of such challenge to the city administrator. If
the developer chooses to pay the reimbursement cost allocation in order to
proceed with development, notice shall be given to the city administrator at
the time of payment, that the payment is made under protest and that the
developer challenges the reimbursement cost allocation. Failure to submit
notice to the city administrator as required by this section shall constitute a
waiver of the developer's right to challenge the reimbursement cost allocation.
The city administrator shall render a decision within thirty (30) calendar days
of receipt of such notice; provided that he/she may, for good cause, extend the
time to render a decision. The city administrator's decision shall be final.

final development approval, prior to recording a plat and prior to issuing
building permits.
   B.   Deferral of Design:
      1.   Application: The developer may submit an application requesting to
defer design.
      2.   City Council Determination: After receiving a recommendation from
the planning commission, the city council shall review the developer's
application for deferred design. City council may approve the application and
allow the developer, future property owner, future developer or city to
complete the design at a later date if city council finds at least one of the
following:
         a.   The developer cannot reasonably design the improvements due to
unique physical characteristics of the real property; or
         b.   The dedication is being deferred and reasonably requires that the
design also be deferred; or
         c.   The construction is being deferred and reasonably requires that
the design also be deferred.
      3.   Deferred Improvement Agreement Required: If a developer applies for
deferred design, a proposed deferred improvement agreement may be presented by
staff for city council consideration. The terms and conditions shall include
the date or timing of future design completion and may include requirements for

deferred improvement agreement entered into pursuant to this article, all
public and nonpublic improvements required as a condition of development
approval shall be installed and dedicated within twenty four (24) months after
the following: 1) the recording date of the plat for all subdivisions; or 2)
the date of the improvement guarantee or other contractual commitment for all
other development. The time for completion may be extended by the city council
after receiving a recommendation from the planning commission.
   B.   Completion Prior to Building Permit: Except as otherwise specifically
stated in this code, unless construction of public improvements is deferred in
accordance with the provisions of this article and a deferred improvement
agreement expressly authorizes issuance of building permits prior to
installation of public improvements, the city shall not issue building permits
until construction of public improvements is complete as evidenced in writing
by the authorized city representative.
   C.   Deferral of Construction:
      1.   Application: The developer may submit an application requesting to
defer construction of public improvements.
      2.   City Council Determination: After receiving a recommendation from
the planning commission, the city council shall review the developer's
application for deferred construction. City council may approve the application
and allow the developer, future property owner, future developer or city to
construct the improvements at a later date if city council finds all of the
following:
         a.   The city engineer has prepared, and city council has reviewed: 1)
the estimated cost of the deferred improvements based on the most recent and
most applicable costs incurred by the city in similar projects; and 2) an
analysis of the feasibility of installing the improvements within the twenty
four (24) month period described in this article; and
         b.   The improvements for which deferred construction is requested
meet one or more of the following criteria: 1) they are eligible public
improvements as defined herein; or 2) they include public improvements for
which some or all of the dedication is being deferred; and
         c.   Based on physical characteristics of the development and affected
real property it is not feasible to install the improvements within the twenty
four (24) month period described above and therefore deferring the installation
to a future date is preferable to the city. Cost of installation shall not be a
factor in determining feasibility for public improvements; and
         d.   The deferred improvements are not necessary for public health or
safety or as a prerequisite to orderly development of the surrounding area.
      3.   Deferred Improvement Agreement Required: If a developer applies for
deferred construction, a proposed deferred improvement agreement may be
presented by staff for city council consideration. The terms and conditions
shall include the date or timing of future construction and may include
requirements for provision of financial guarantee, recordation with the Salt
Lake County recorder and other reasonable terms. City council may accept,
reject or modify the proposed agreement. (Ord. 13-02, 2-13-2013; amd. Ord. 19-

8-3B-13: IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEE AND AGREEMENT REQUIRED:
   A.   Improvements Constructed with Development: The developer of a
subdivision shall not be required to complete construction of public
improvements prior to dedication of real property or recording of a subdivision
plat. Construction of improvements that are not deferred shall be guaranteed by
an improvement guarantee as set forth in article C of this chapter, and an
improvement guarantee agreement shall be executed as a condition of development
approval and prior to plat recordation or issuance of building permit,
whichever earlier occurs.
   B.   Deferred Improvements: A cash deposit may be required to guarantee
construction of deferred improvements, and a deferred improvement agreement
shall be executed and recorded with the Salt Lake County recorder prior to plat
recordation or building permit issuance, whichever earlier occurs. If design or
dedication is deferred, a cash deposit may be required to guarantee deferred
dedication and design, and a deferred improvement agreement shall be executed
and recorded with the Salt Lake County recorder prior to plat recordation or
building permit issuance, whichever earlier occurs. (Ord. 13-02, 2-13-2013;
amd. Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-3B-14: DEFERRED IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT:
   A.   Application for Deferred Improvement Agreement: An application shall be
required prior to consideration by the city of a deferred improvement
agreement.

property, without regard to mortgage holders.
   D.   Collection of Deficiency for City Project:
      1.   If the actual cost of property acquisition, design and construction
of a city project exceeds the amount of the cash deposit, the city may expend
the cash deposit and use the deferred improvement agreement to collect the
deficiency. The then current owner(s) of the property shall be obligated by the
deferred improvement agreement to pay the difference to the city, without
regard to mortgage holders.
      2.   The then current owner of the property obligated by the terms of the
deferred improvement agreement, with the written permission of the city, may
choose to dedicate, design and install the deferred improvements. Upon
inspection and approval of the improvements by the city, the property owner may
seek reimbursement of the costs of the improvements up to the value of the cash
deposit. The city shall reimburse actual costs using the cash deposit unless
there are legal reasons preventing the city from doing so. (Ord. 13-02, 2-13-

The purpose and scope of this article is to provide for and govern construction
and the form, amount and release of financial assurance for all public
improvements, and all private streets, boundary fences, and nonpublic
improvements which will be installed as a condition of development. As used in
this article, "public improvements" shall mean all improvements which will be
dedicated to the city or be installed in the public right-of-way. (2001 Code §
89-6-1201; amd. Ord. 13-03, 2-13-2013; Ord. 14-07, 3-12-2014; Ord. 19-48, 12-
11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-3C-2: INSTALLATION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF
DEVELOPMENT:
With regards to the construction of public and nonpublic improvements and the
recording of the subdivision plat, a developer has the following options and
responsibilities:
   A.   Option A - Construction Required Prior to Recording Plat: Unless the
developer chooses option B, construction of all public improvements required as
a condition of development shall be completed pursuant to a land disturbance
permit issued under title 11 of this Code prior to plat recordation or building
permit issuance. The developer shall warrant the public improvements according
to the provisions of this article and provide financial assurance for the
warranty. Unless otherwise expressly excepted by this article, no subdivision
plat shall be recorded, no lots shall be sold, and no building permits shall be
issued until:
      1.   Construction of all "essential public improvements" (as defined in
subsection D of this section) is complete; and
      2.   All essential public improvements have been accepted by the city in
accordance with this article.
   B.   Option B - Additional Financial Assurance and Recording Plat Prior to
Construction: At the developer's option, the subdivision plat may be recorded
prior to construction of public improvements, provided that the city and
developer enter into an improvement construction and assurance agreement
providing financial assurance. The improvement construction and assurance
agreement may authorize construction of public improvements to be completed
within twenty four (24) months after the date of final plat recordation. The
improvement construction and assurance agreement shall be in a form acceptable
to the city, securing the satisfactory completion of all required public and
nonpublic improvements and the warranty of all public improvements. After the
effective date of the improvement construction and assurance agreement, the
plat may be recorded and lots may be sold, but no building permits shall be
issued until:
      1.   Construction of all essential public improvements is complete; and
      2.   All essential public improvements have been accepted by the city in
accordance with this article.
   C.   Changing Options: If a developer chooses option A and begins the
construction of public improvements and if the developer meets the requirements
of option B, then the developer may later, with the signed, written approval of
the city engineer, and after a filing fee has been paid according to the city's
uniform fee schedule, change to option B, but may not subsequently change back
to option A. If a developer chooses option B and records the subdivision plat,
then the developer may not later change to option A.
   D.   Definition of "Essential Public Improvements": For purposes of this
article, this term means public improvements which are essential and required
to be completely installed, inspected, tested, and serviceable before the
issuance of building permits for each phase of a subdivision, site plan, or
other development, as follows:
      1.   Recorded plat, unless it is a model home (approved by the city as
part of a written agreement) or some other exception specifically allowed by
city regulations;
      2.   Access to the development, including a possible secondary and/or
public safety access (if required);
      3.   "Continuous all-weather temporary street/road surface", defined as a
street/road constructed with a minimum of site specific required structural
fill for permanent roads and road base, or other approved material complying
with local standards, including a street surface designed to support an 80,000-
pound load, and including necessary clear road width (see Utah Code section
15A-5-205.6 and IFC section 3310.1);
      4.   Temporary street identification signs shall be installed at each
street intersection when construction of new roadways allows passage by
vehicles. Signs shall be of an approved size, weather resistant, and be
maintained until replaced by permanent signs. Where required by the fire code
official, address identification shall be provided in additional approved
locations to facilitate emergency response (see IFC sec. 501.4 and 505.2 and
IBC sec. 501.2);
      5.   Culinary water system improvements (which shall be installed,
inspected, tested, and serviceable);
      6.   Fire hydrants and, if required, fire suppression lines and other
fire system improvements (which shall be installed, inspected, tested, and
serviceable);
      7.   Special or private improvement systems, for which exchanges,
enhanced entitlements, or other consideration was received, as specified in a
development plan and/or development agreement (and which shall be bonded for;
or installed, inspected, tested, and serviceable); and
      8.   Any other infrastructure required by the building code or fire code
(which shall be bonded for; or installed, inspected, tested, and serviceable).
   E.   Deny Building Permits: The city shall deny an applicant a building
permit(s) if:
      1.   The applicant has not completed one or more essential public
improvements; or
      2.   The plans of and for the proposed erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, building, or other structure or use do not fully
conform to all regulations, permits, plats and approvals then in effect.
   F.   Public Improvements Necessary for Building Occupancy: No permanent or
temporary certificate of occupancy shall be given and no building may be
occupied until all essential public improvements (listed in subsection D of
this section) and other public improvements (listed in this subsection) are
completely installed, inspected, tested, and serviceable, unless the developer
or builder can establish, to the satisfaction of the city, that any remaining
public improvements are not necessary to the safety required for building
occupancy:
      1.   Sanitary sewer system improvements (installed, inspected, tested,
and serviceable);
      2.   Storm drainage system improvements (installed, inspected, tested,
and serviceable, but does not require final landscaping);
      3.   Other street system improvements, including all asphalt; curb,
gutter, and sidewalk; and permanent street name, dead end, and traffic control
signs (installed, inspected, tested, and serviceable); and
      4.   Any other infrastructure required by city regulations (installed,
inspected, tested, and serviceable); and all inspections have been successfully
completed; but
      5.   If approved by the city engineer, minor punch list items covered by
an improvement construction and assurance agreement do not have to be completed
for a permanent certificate of occupancy; in such cases, a temporary
certificate of occupancy may be issued.
   G.   No Third Party Beneficiaries: The city imposed requirements of the
improvement construction and assurance agreement and associated financial
assurance:
      1.   Are for the sole benefit of the city;
      2.   Are not for the individual benefit of any citizen or identifiable
class of citizens, including, but not limited to, the purchasers of lots or
building spaces within the development for which the improvement assurance is
required;
      3.   Are not for the purpose of ensuring that funds are available for the
payment to material suppliers or labor suppliers, and no rights shall accrue to
such suppliers; and
      4.   Shall not create any city obligation to third parties to:
         a.   Enforce its terms;
         b.   Install the improvements; or
         c.   Respond in damages for the lack of full enforcement of the
improvement assurance or the lack of complete installation of the improvements.

   B.   System Reduction Request: For public improvements that are subject to a
public improvement construction and assurance agreement, the developer may
submit system inspection and reduction requests no more frequently than once
every thirty (30) calendar days after completing a system or systems. One
interim reduction may be requested for the public landscaping system if the
public landscaping improvements are substantially complete and seasonal
conditions prevent total completion, testing and inspection.
      1.   Except as otherwise allowed by this article for public landscaping
improvements, the financial assurance may only be reduced upon satisfactory
completion of an entire system, as determined by the city engineer. The amount
of the reduction shall be determined by the city engineer and shall not exceed
ninety percent (90%) of the initial assurance amount for the completed system.
      2.   If seasonal weather conditions prevent the public landscaping
improvements from being completed, tested and inspected, the financial
assurance may be reduced upon substantial completion of the public landscaping
system, as determined by the city engineer. To the extent reasonably practical,
the completed portion of the public landscaping improvements must be inspected
by the city and found by the city engineer to be in full compliance with city
ordinances, standards and specifications, and the approved engineering
drawings. The amount of the interim landscaping reduction shall be determined
by the city engineer and shall not exceed seventy five percent (75%) of the
initial assurance amount for the public landscaping system.

engineer has inspected the improvements and found them to be in full compliance
with city ordinances, standards and specifications, and the approved
engineering drawings. All reductions shall be by written authorization of the
city engineer.
      4.   A system reduction shall not constitute city acceptance of any
system or any portion of the public improvements. City acceptance shall only be
by the letter of acceptance issued in accordance with this article. The
warranty period will not commence until after city acceptance. (2001 Code § 89-
6-1206; amd. Ord. 13-03, 2-13-2013; 2009 Code § 8-3C-6; Ord. 14-07, 3-12-2014;

   B.   Warranty Period, Repairs and Maintenance:
      1.   The warranty period shall be a minimum of twelve (12) months.
      2.   The warranty period may be longer if the city:
         a.   Determines for good cause that a one year period would be
inadequate to protect the public health, safety and welfare; and
         b.   Has substantial evidence on record:
            (1)   Of prior poor performance of the applicant; or
            (2)   That the area upon which the infrastructure will be
constructed contains suspect soil and the municipality has not otherwise
required the applicant to mitigate the suspect soil.
      3.   The warranty period will begin on the date of city acceptance as
defined in this article.
      4.   During the warranty period the developer shall unconditionally
warrant that the public improvements comply with the city's written standards
for design, materials and workmanship and will not fail in any material respect
as a result of poor workmanship or materials.
      5.   Prior to commencing the warranty period, the developer shall submit
to the city a maintenance plan for public landscaping. During the warranty
period, the city shall provide maintenance of accepted public improvements and
follow the public landscaping maintenance plan. Landscaping failure within the
warranty period shall be presumed to be due to defective materials or
workmanship if the city certifies that the city, or its contractor,
substantially followed the maintenance plan.
      6.   Regardless of cause, repair work shall be the responsibility of the
developer until the date on which the warranty period begins.
      7.   The warranty provisions of this chapter shall not apply to nonpublic
improvements.

shall prepare a corrections list identifying incomplete, unsatisfactory and
defective items. The developer shall complete the corrections items within
forty five (45) days and submit a written request for reinspection. Failure to
complete the corrections list items within forty five (45) days may result in
additional reinspections and preparation of revised corrections lists.
   D.   If corrections items are not timely completed or a written request for
reinspection or certificate of completion is not submitted, the following shall
apply: 1) the developer shall be responsible for the cost of each additional
inspection and preparation of additional corrections lists; 2) for warranty
inspections, the public improvements shall not be accepted by the city, the
warranty period shall not commence and the developer will remain responsible
for all cost and expense of repairing the improvements, including, without
limitation, administrative costs, labor and materials costs; 3) the developer
shall be responsible for all additional deterioration and damage caused by the
failure to timely correct defective conditions or request the reinspection; and
4) the city shall have the right to make demand on the proceeds of the
financial assurance or warranty assurance, as applicable, for incomplete,
unsatisfactory or defective items.
   E.   Upon verification by the city engineer and the city administrator that
there is no corrections list or the corrections list items have been
satisfactorily completed in accordance with the approved engineering drawings
and the city ordinances, standards and specifications, and provided that the
requirements of this article are met for city acceptance, the city

way to its original condition. (2001 Code § 72-3-404)
   D.   Additional Bonds and Cash Deposits: The city engineer may at any time
require an additional bond or cash deposit upon finding that the amount of a

create any right to use property adjacent to the right-of-way, and permittee
shall be responsible for coordination with owners of adjacent property.
      2.   In areas too narrow to permit the proper storage of materials, the
city engineer may require that the permittee remove the materials from the
encroachment site. (2001 Code § 72-3-611)
   J.   Monuments: A monument set for the purpose of preserving survey points,
lines or elevation shall not be removed or disturbed without first obtaining

by the city engineer. (2001 Code § 72-3-614)
   M.   Small Pipes: Laterals, services, and other small diameter pipes shall
be jacked, bored, or driven beneath a paved surface unless other methods are
approved by the city engineer. (2001 Code § 72-3-615)
   N.   Covering Pipes and Conduits: The minimum cover over any pipe or conduit
installed under any right-of-way shall be thirty inches (30") of material
measured from the existing or proposed flow line of the nearest gutter to the
top of the pipe or conduit. If a gutter flow line is not established, the cover
shall be thirty inches (30") of material measured from the surface of the
nearest outermost edge of the traveled way to the top of the pipe or conduit.
Where there are existing curbs and gutters or where curbs and gutters are under
construction, utilities may maintain a minimum thirty inches (30") of cover
starting one foot (1') back of the curb line in the parkway or sidewalk area.
Maximum cover shall be seventy two inches (72"). The city engineer may permit
the installation of pipes or conduits at lesser or greater depths where the
required cover cannot be provided. (2001 Code § 72-3-616)
   O.   Backfilling: The backfilling and compaction of an excavation shall be

notified by the city engineer, the work may be done by the city engineer and
the permittee charged in accordance with the fees adopted by the city council.
      2.   When a pole, guy stub or similar timber is removed and not replaced,
the entire length thereof shall be removed from the ground and the hole
backfilled and compacted.
   R.   Coordination of Major Work Within the Right-of- Way:
      1.   The city engineer may, on or prior to January 1 of each year,
publish a schedule identifying the location and anticipated start date and
completion date of major work anticipated to be performed within and by the
city during the period beginning on the next succeeding January 1. The schedule
may be updated every six (6) months and shall be available for inspection at
the office of the city engineer.
      2.   Applications for encroachments involving major work shall be
accepted by the city engineer on or before November 1 of each calendar year for
the next year period beginning on the next succeeding January 1. The
application must be on a form approved by the city engineer and must include a
construction schedule which identifies, in reasonable detail, the location and
anticipated start date and completion date of all anticipated major work.
      3.   Permit issuance may be denied or delayed by the city engineer where
the person requesting a permit fails to timely apply or does not accurately
identify the major work as set forth in this section. Among other things, the
city engineer will consider excavation restrictions and other major work when
determining the denial or delay.
      4.   It shall be the general policy of the city engineer to facilitate
coordination of major work by disclosing application information to other
applicants. Any requests to maintain the confidentiality of information
submitted pursuant to this section will be considered by the city in accordance
with the provisions of the Utah government records, access and management act.
      5.   In issuing or conditioning a permit for major work, the city
engineer may do any or all of the following: a) schedule work in the right-of-
way in the order in which applications are filed, and without regard to other
work in the right-of-way; b) delay or accelerate the commencement date of major
work so that such work is performed simultaneously; or c) delay or accelerate
the commencement date of major work so that such work is performed in sequence,
or is separated by a reasonable period of time.
      6.   Each applicant shall use all available information to coordinate, in
good faith, its major work in the right-of-way with work proposed by the city
and other users.
   S.   Excess Capacity:
      1.   Each competitive utility provider applicant must determine the size
of facilities required to provide the capacity reasonably anticipated to
satisfy the needs of such applicant for a minimum of five (5) years following
installation and present its determination to the city.
      2.   Facilities must be designed and constructed to provide the capacity
described above, or such lesser capacity as reasonably approved by the city
engineer.
   T.   Excavation Restrictions:
      1.   The city engineer may, from time to time, impose excavation
restrictions on portions of the right-of-way. The city engineer will not issue
a permit for any portion of the right-of-way subject to an excavation
restriction, except as set forth in this section.
      2.   The duration of the excavation restrictions will be as follows:
         a.   Seven (7) years following the completion of a new street or
portion thereof;
         b.   Three (3) years following the resurfacing of a street or portion
thereof;
         c.   Five (5) years following the completion of any excavation work in
the right-of-way. The city engineer may impose the restriction solely on the
user who performed the work, or on such owner and other prospective permittees
or class of permittees as the city engineer determines;
         d.   Until excess capacity no longer exists, for any portion of the
right-of-way where excess capacity exists.
      3.   The excavation restrictions may include, but are not limited to, one
or more, or a combination of the following:
         a.   A limited restriction prohibiting excavation by one user or type
of user that does not preclude excavations by different users or types of
users;
         b.   A comprehensive restriction prohibiting all excavation and
construction activity in the affected portion of the right-of-way;
         c.   A restriction defining methods and standards of excavation or
construction activity within the affected portion of the right-of-way.
      4.   The nature, scope and duration of the restriction will be consistent
with the terms described in the notice provided for in this section. The
nature, scope and duration of each excavation restriction shall be evidenced in
writing, which writing shall be available for inspection during regular
business hours at the office of the city engineer.
   U.   Notice of Excavation Restrictions:
      1.   The city engineer shall publish, or cause to be published, annual
notice advertising his/her intent to impose excavation restrictions relating to
portions of the right-of-way which will be under construction during the next
succeeding calendar year. The notice shall be published at least once each week
for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within
the city, which is used by the city for the publication of legal notices;
provided that the first publication shall be on or before December 31. In
addition, such notice shall be mailed by the city engineer to each person who
has made written request therefor. The notice shall describe the following:
         a.   The nature of the project giving rise to the restriction;
         b.   The portion of the right-of-way affected by the restriction;
         c.   The effective date of the restriction;
         d.   The duration of the restriction; and
         e.   The nature of the restriction.
      2.   The notice shall invite those to whom the restriction will apply to
participate in the project in the manner described by the city engineer, which
may include any or all of the following:
         a.   Locating facilities in the same trench as an applicant;
         b.   Sharing the cost of joint facilities with an applicant;
         c.   Collocating facilities within a common conduit;
         d.   Entering into lease arrangements with the applicant;

         h.   The notice shall further provide that all interested users must
file a permit application with the city engineer not later than six (6) weeks
prior to the estimated date of commencement of construction of the proposed
project. Nothing herein shall require the city engineer to publish notice of an
excavation restriction which applies to only one user, provided that written
notice of such excavation restriction is mailed or otherwise provided to such
user.
   V.   Suspension of Excavation Restrictions: The city engineer may
temporarily or permanently suspend an excavation restriction for any of the
following reasons:
      1.   To permit work to be performed by the city;
      2.   To permit emergency repair work, or, in the discretion of the city
engineer, work which could not reasonably have been anticipated by the
applicant at the time of publication of the notice of excavation restrictions;
      3.   Excess capacity no longer exists in the restricted portion of the
right-of-way;
      4.   To permit the installation of service laterals, the need for which
could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time of publication of the
notice of excavation restrictions; or
      5.   Suspension of the restriction is otherwise in the city's best
interest. (2001 Code § 72-3-619; 2009 Code; § 8-8-6; amd. Ord. 16-16, 4-13-
2016; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-8-8: BUS SHELTERS AND BENCHES 1 :
   A.   Improvements: All street improvements (i.e., curb, gutter, and
sidewalk) shall be in place, prior to the installation of a bus bench or bus
shelter.
   B.   Location: Bus benches or shelters shall be located behind the sidewalk,
on private property, and only at bus stops designated by the Utah transit
authority (UTA); provided, that: 1) a physical barrier exists behind the
sidewalk which prevents the placement of a bench or shelter at that location;
or 2) the property owner refuses to grant approval for the placement of the
bench or shelter behind the sidewalk; and 3) there is adequate depth in the
park strip so that the bus bench or bus shelter will not encroach on the
sidewalk and there is a minimum distance between the front edge of the bench or
shelter and the face of the adjacent curb of forty eight inches (48") on state
roads and twenty four inches (24") on city streets. Any person requesting
approval to locate a bus bench or bus shelter in a street right-of-way shall
first submit written documentation from the property owner that approval to
locate the shelter or bench behind the sidewalk has been refused. Nonetheless,
bus benches and bus shelter signs shall not be located in clear vision areas at
intersections and shall not obstruct sidewalks, roadways or other locations
where the structures may pose a hazard to motorists or pedestrians. Benches
installed by UTA which carry no message may be located within a right-of-way.
However, bus benches or bus shelters proposed to be located adjacent to state
roads shall comply with all applicable state provisions governing the location
and site development standards for such benches or shelters.
   C.   Construction and Materials: The following provisions shall govern the
construction and materials for bus benches and bus shelters:
      1.   Bus bench backs and seats shall be constructed of metal, fiberglass
or rigid plastic/vinyl materials and shall be kept in good repair. Bench legs
shall be constructed of reinforced concrete. The design and materials of bus
shelters shall be approved by the city prior to issuing permits.
      2.   A concrete pad shall be required for all bus benches and bus
shelters. The minimum pad size for bus benches shall be four feet by six feet
(4' x 6'), and the minimum pad size for a bus shelter shall be two feet (2')
wider than the width of the shelter and two feet (2') longer than the length of
the shelter. Additional space should also be designed for persons in
wheelchairs and/or to provide additional waiting area for bus patrons.
      3.   The minimum pad area for a bus bench or bus shelter may include part
of a sidewalk. However, no bus bench or bus shelter shall infringe upon or
obstruct any sidewalk, other pedestrian path, or driveway without adding paving
which meets passage standards established by the Americans with disabilities
act (ADA).
      4.   Bus benches and bus shelters shall be securely fastened to the
concrete pad. Upon removal of a bench or shelter, the concrete pad shall be
repaired by the owner of the bench or shelter, including removal of attachment
bolts and repair of all holes in the concrete pad.
   D.   Shelter Design: Bus shelters shall be designed to meet the following
requirements:
      1.   A minimum four foot three inch by fifteen foot (4'3" x 15') concrete
pad for each shelter, with interior seating and patron waiting area;
      2.   A minimum five foot by eight foot (5' x 8') ADA landing pad in park
strip (when required);
      3.   Interior room for wheelchair passengers;
      4.   Minimum three foot (3') wide entry;
      5.   City name and logo on both ends of the shelter;
      6.   Name and service number to call for service of shelter;
      7.   Twenty four (24) hour interior illumination;
      8.   The shelter is to be bolted to a concrete pad;
      9.   All electrical wiring is to be located underground; and
      10.   All shelters shall include a trash receptacle of a matching color
and design.
   E.   Insurance: For any bus bench or bus shelter sign, the company or person
responsible for the bus bench or shelter sign shall enter into an agreement
with the city, which must be approved by the city attorney. This agreement will
require, among other things, that the company or person responsible for the bus
bench or bus shelter sign provide to the city proof of liability insurance in
the minimum amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), name the city as an
additional insured, and indemnify and hold harmless the city from any and all
injuries and defense costs arising from the placement or use of the bus bench
or bus shelter sign.
   F.   Violation: Failure to comply with the bus bench and bus shelter
provisions shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   G.   Removal: The city engineer may require removal of a bus bench or bus
shelter that does not comply with the requirements of this section. The city
engineer shall mail notice, postage prepaid, to the address provided in the
agreement. The notice shall state the nature of the noncompliance and the date
by which remediation or removal shall be complete, which date shall be no less
than thirty (30) calendar days after mailing. Failure to remediate or remove
the bus bench or bus shelter within the notice period shall be a separate
violation for each day the bus bench or bus shelter remains in place. (2001
Code § 89-6-1108; amd. 2009 Code; § 8-8-7; Ord. 16-16, 4-13-2016; Ord. 19-48,

Notes
1    1. See also subsection
  12-3-3 C of this code for sign permit requirements.
8-8-9: RELOCATION AND REMOVAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Expense of Owner: If any city construction or other maintenance work in
a right-of-way requires the relocation or removal of an encroachment or
facility located over, under, in or through any right-of-way, the owner shall
relocate or remove the encroachment or facility at owner's sole expense. The
provisions of this section are not intended in any way to supersede or override
any prior right which otherwise exists in favor of the owner.
   B.   Written Demand by City: When removal or relocation is required, the
city engineer shall give the owner a written demand: 1) specifying that the
encroachment or facility must be relocated or removed from the right-of-way;
and 2) stating a reasonable time within which the encroachment or facility must
be relocated or removed. If the owner fails to comply, the city may relocate or
remove the encroachment or facility at the expense of the owner in accordance
with the fees adopted by the city council.
   C.   Reasonable Time Defined: In determining what is a reasonable time for
the purposes of this section, the city engineer will take into consideration
the nature of the encroachment or facility, the urgency of the need for its
removal, the cost of its removal, the difficulty of its removal, the value of
the intact property of the owner, and other facts peculiar to the particular
situation.
   D.   Restoration: When an encroachment or facility is removed and not
replaced, the entire encroachment or facility must be removed from the right-
of-way and the hole backfilled and compacted and returned to its preexisting
condition unless the city engineer permits otherwise. The city engineer may
designate a reasonable area for relocation within the right of way. (2001 Code
§ 72-3-701; amd. 2009 Code; § 8-8-8; Ord. 16-16, 4-13-2016; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-
2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-8-10: PUBLIC SAFETY:
   A.   Interference with Use of Highways: All encroachments shall be planned
and executed in such a manner that they will not unreasonably interfere with
the safe and convenient travel of the general public. At no time shall a public
highway be closed or the use thereof denied to the general public without the
approval of the city engineer. (2001 Code § 72-3-801)
   B.   Safety Devices:
      1.   In the conduct of the encroachment, the permittee must provide and
maintain such safety devices, including, but not limited to, lights,
barricades, signs, flagmen and message boards, as are necessary to protect the
public. Any omission on the part of the city engineer to specify in the permit
what safety devices must be provided by the permittee will not excuse the
permittee from complying with all laws and regulations relating to the
protection of persons under the circumstances. If the city engineer finds that
suitable safeguards are not being provided, he or she may provide, maintain and
relocate such safety devices as are deemed necessary, or he or she may revoke
the permit, subject to appeal as provided in this chapter, and restore the
right-of-way in accordance with existing city standards, charging the permittee
in accordance with the fees adopted by the city council.
      2.   A permittee making any excavation or leaving any obstruction which
could be a hazard to persons using a right-of-way shall provide and maintain
warning lights far enough away from the excavation or obstruction to give
adequate warning to such persons, and at spacing of not more than fifty feet
(50') along the excavation or obstruction, from one-half (1/2) hour before
sunset of each day to one-half (1/2) hour after sunrise the next day, until the
work is completed and the right-of-way is made safe for use.
      3.   All safety devices shall conform to the requirements of the
encroachment permit and requirements of the city engineer. (2001 Code § 72-3-
802; amd. 2009 Code)
   C.   Visibility Aids: When the location or position of an encroachment
impairs visibility to vehicular traffic, the city engineer may require that the
encroachment be painted or equipped with reflectors or other aids to
visibility, or the city engineer may require the encroachment to be relocated
at the sole expense of the permittee. No encroachment shall be maintained
across any sidewalk area or shoulder of a public highway. No encroachment of
any nature shall be permitted or maintained which impedes, obstructs, denies or
impairs the sight distance for safe pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
   D.   Tampering with Traffic Barricades: It is unlawful for any person
maliciously or wantonly or without authorization and legal cause to extinguish,
remove or diminish any light illuminating any barricade or excavation or to
tear down or remove any rail, fence or barricade protecting any excavation or
other construction site. (2001 Code § 72-3-803; 2009 Code; § 8-8-9; amd. Ord.
16-16, 4-13-2016; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6,

8-8-11: APPEALS:
   A.   Appeals; Form: Any person aggrieved by the refusal, suspension or
revocation of a permit may appeal to the city administrator within ten (10)
days after the date of such action. The appeal shall be in the form of a
written notice filed with the city recorder and signed by the applicant or
permittee. The notice shall have attached a copy of the application and shall
recite and include copies of such other items as have been filed. The notice
shall state clearly and concisely the grounds upon which the applicant relies
in the appeal.
   B.   Hearing: The city administrator shall set the matter for a hearing on
the closest practicable date after the notice is filed and shall notify the
applicant and the city engineer of the hearing date.
   C.   City Administrator Action: At the hearing, the applicant shall
establish to the satisfaction of the city administrator that he or she is
entitled to the issuance of a permit pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter. The city engineer may present grounds for the denial of the permit.
The city administrator's decision shall be final. (2001 Code § 72-3-901; amd.
2009 Code; Ord. 12-10, 4-25-2012, eff. 7-1-2012; § 8-8-10; Ord. 16-16, 4-13-
2016; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-8-12: VIOLATIONS:
Failure to comply with any provision of this chapter, the encroachment permit,
or any order of suspension, revocation or stop work shall be deemed a violation
of this chapter. Each day the violation exists shall be a separate offense. No
criminal conviction shall excuse the person from otherwise complying. (2001
Code § 72-3-1001; amd. 2009 Code; § 8-8-11; Ord. 16-16, 4-13-2016)
8-8-13: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Authority: The public works department shall enforce all of the
provisions of this chapter, employing all legal means available to do so. The
public works director may designate any department employee as an enforcement
official.
   B.   Enforcement Proceedings: Unless otherwise provided, this chapter may be
enforced through administrative procedures, or by filing civil or criminal
actions as provided by law. The city has sole discretion to decide whether to
file a civil or criminal case for a violation. The city may file both or one or
the other. The possibility of an administrative remedy shall in no way
interfere with the city's right to prosecute violations of this chapter as
criminal offenses, or to seek any civil remedy to enjoin, prevent, or abate the
violation. If the city chooses to file both civil and criminal charges for the
same violation on the same day, no civil fines shall be assessed, but all other
remedies shall be available. (Ord. 16-16, 4-13-2016)
8-8-14: SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION OF PERMIT BY CITY ENGINEER:
   A.   Permit Revocable: Under the provisions of this chapter, the issuance of
a permit grants only a revocable privilege of encroachment and confers no
vested rights of any kind or nature upon a permittee. Every encroachment permit
issued by the city may be revoked or suspended for the following:
      1.   Failure by the permittee or agents, officers, employees or
contractors to comply with any provision of the encroachment permit, this
chapter, a stop work order or any other applicable ordinance or law relating to
the encroachment. The permittee shall be strictly responsible for conformance
of the encroachment with all applicable laws;
      2.   Fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact in the procurement of
the encroachment permit;
      3.   Failure to pay when due any fee, charge or penalty provided in city
ordinance;
      4.   The existence of any condition or doing of any act which does
constitute, may constitute, or cause a condition endangering life, health or
property; or
      5.   Any other reason expressly provided for in this chapter, or any act
or failure to act identified as a violation in this chapter.
   B.   Authority: The city engineer may revoke or suspend the encroachment
permit without a hearing for reasons provided in this chapter; however, the
suspension or revocation will not take effect until the time period for
appealing the decision as set forth in this chapter has passed. Written notice
of the suspension or revocation will be given by personal service or registered
mail to the permittee. The written notice shall state: the reasons for such
decision; that continuation of the encroachment after the effective date of the
suspension or revocation is a class B misdemeanor and a violation of this
chapter; that the decision may be appealed; and a general summary of the appeal
procedure. If the violation results in a danger to life, health, or property, a
stop work order will also be issued.
   C.   Effect of Revocation or Suspension:
      1.   After revocation, the permittee must reapply for a new encroachment
permit and pay the application fee. Except for activity specifically described
in the order of revocation as required to remove the encroachment, any
encroachment or activity that occurs prior to issuance of a new encroachment
permit will be a violation of this chapter and punishable as such.
      2.   A suspension will be in effect for no less than two (2) and no more
than ten (10) days. The reinstatement fee will be as adopted by city council or
if no reinstatement fee is adopted, fifty percent (50%) of the application fee
as adopted. Except for activity specifically described in the order of
suspension as required to remove the encroachment during the suspension period,
any encroachment or activity that occurs during the suspension period will be a
violation of this chapter and punishable as such. (Ord. 16-16, 4-13-2016; amd.
Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-8-15: STOP WORK ORDER:
   A.   Issuance of Stop Work Order: A stop work order may be issued for any of
the following: causing any encroachment in the right-of-way without a valid and
unexpired encroachment permit; violation of this chapter; failure to comply
with any other city ordinance or law related to the encroachment; existence of
any condition or doing of any act which does constitute, may constitute, or
cause a condition endangering life, health or property.
   B.   Authority: A stop work order may be issued by the city engineer or
engineering inspector directed to any person or persons causing the
encroachment, violation or dangerous condition.
   C.   Effect: The stop work order will take effect immediately upon delivery
to any person performing work or encroaching in the right-of-way or immediately
upon posting of a stop work order at the location of the encroachment. If an
encroachment permit has been issued, a copy of the stop work order should,
within one business day, be sent by e-mail, facsimile, hand delivery or any
mail or delivery service to the address indicated by the permittee on the
encroachment permit. Defective mailing or failure to receive delivery,
regardless of cause, will not render the stop work order ineffective. The stop
work order will remain in effect until the city engineer or engineering
inspector has verified remediation of conditions and compliance with
requirements for which the stop work order was issued. Except for activity
specifically described in the stop work order as required to abate the
violation or condition for which the stop work order was issued, any
encroachment or activity that occurs during the stop work period will be a
violation of this chapter and punishable as such. Failure to comply with a stop
work order may result in suspension or revocation of the encroachment permit.

8-8-16: ABATEMENT; NOTICE TO SURETY; EXPENDITURE OF CASH GUARANTEE:
   A.   Notice to Surety:
      1.   If a surety bond has been provided, the surety may be given written
notice of a violation with a copy provided to the principal. The written notice
shall state the nature of the violation, the work to be done to correct the
violation, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of time in which the work
must be completed.
      2.   Work must be commenced and diligently pursued, or the surety shall
indemnify the city for the cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice,
within a reasonable time following the giving of such notice. In determining a
reasonable time, the following will be considered: the exigencies of the
situation; the nature of the work; the requirements of public safety; and
protection of persons and property.
      3.   If the work is not commenced and pursued, and the city is not
indemnified as set forth in this section, the city may perform the work, cause
the work to be performed by contract or both, at the discretion of the city
engineer. Suit may be brought against the surety and principal and such other
persons as may be liable, to recover the entire amount due to the city,
including attorney fees.
   B.   Expenditure of Cash Guarantee:

   A.   Declaration of Finding and Intent:
      1.   Findings Regarding Rights-of-Way: The city finds that the rights-of-
way within the city:
         a.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property
in the business and social life of the city;
         b.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
         c.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and
other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered
for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well
being of the city and its citizens; and
         d.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights-of-way.
      2.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the city should
receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
      3.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights-of-way, Municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
      4.   Finding Regarding Promotion of Telecommunications Services: The city
finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote
the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscrimination
basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability
for Municipal, educational and community services.
      5.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
         a.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
         b.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights-of-way to serve the public;
         c.   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm
that may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;
         d.   Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority
of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
         e.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and
use of the city infrastructure;
         f.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights-
of-way; and
         g.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Act) (PL no. 104-104).
      6.   Power to Manage Rights-of-Way: The city adopts this article pursuant
to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the state
constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable
compensation for the use of rights-of-way by providers as expressly set forth
by section 253 of the Act. (2001 Code § 82-2-102)
   B.   Scope of Article: This article shall provide the basic local scheme for
providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of
the rights-of-way, including providers of both the system and service, those
providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system
but who only provide services. This article shall apply to all future providers
and to all providers in the city prior to the effective date hereof, whether
operating with or without a franchise as set forth in subsection
 8-9A-9B of this article. (2001 Code § 82-2-103)
   C.   Excluded Activity:

otherwise regulated by the city cable television ordinance.
      2.   Wireless Services: This article shall not apply to personal wireless

   D.   Obligation to Notify Owners Prior to Entering Private Property: Before

to contact the property owners in advance, and describe the work to be
performed. (2001 Code § 82-2-105)
   E.   Conflicts: In the event of a conflict between any provision of this
article and a franchise entered pursuant to this article, the provisions of
this article shall control. (2001 Code § 82-2-106)
   F.   Severability: If any provision of this article is held by any federal,
state or local court of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting
with any federal or state statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in
any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law and all
appellate remedies with regard to the validity of the provisions in question
are exhausted, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct and
independent part of this article, and such holding shall not affect the
validity and enforceability of all other provisions of this article. If such
law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that
the provision which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict
with such law, the provision in question shall return to full force and effect
and shall again be binding on the city and the provider; provided, that the
city shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period of time as
may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such a rejuvenated
provision, written notice of the change before requiring compliance with such
provision. (2001 Code § 82-2-107)
   G.   New Developments: It shall be the policy of the city to liberally amend
this article, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the
provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of
telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more
effectively, efficiently or economically serve itself or the public. (2001 Code
§ 82-2-108)
   H.   Notices: All notices from a provider to the city required under this
article or pursuant to a franchise granted pursuant to this article shall be
directed to the officer as designated by the mayor. A provider shall provide in
any application for a franchise the identity, address and phone number of the
person to receive notices from the city. A provider shall immediately notify
the city of any change in its name, address or telephone number. (2001 Code §
82-2-109; amd. 2009 Code)
   I.   Exercise of Police Power: To the full extent permitted by applicable
law either now or in the future, the city reserves the right to adopt or issue
such rules, regulations, orders, or other directives that it finds necessary or
appropriate in the lawful exercise of its police powers. (2001 Code § 82-2-110;
amd. § 8-9-1, Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12
noon on January 6, 2020)
8-9A-2: FRANCHISE:
   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise: The city is empowered and authorized to issue
nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction and
maintenance of systems in the city rights-of-way, in accordance with the
provisions of this article. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the city and provider. (2001 Code § 82-2-201)
   B.   Provider Required to Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by federal
or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services using the rights-of-way, and every provider must obtain a franchise
before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via
an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the city is not preempted as ultimately interpreted by
a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that
particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does
not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of
illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain
a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services
over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise. (2001
Code § 82-2-202)
   C.   Nature of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or
subleased, except as may be expressly provided in the franchise agreement. A
franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole
attachment agreements before collocating its system on the property of others,
including the city's property. This subsection shall not be construed to
prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the
lessee has obtained a franchise. (2001 Code § 82-2-203)
   D.   Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by federal or state
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date hereof shall
request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety (90) days of the
effective date hereof. If such request is made, the provider may continue
providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not
made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider
shall comply with the provisions of subsection
8-9A-8D of this article. (2001 Code § 82-2-204)
   E.   Nature of Franchise: The franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this article shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services. (2001 Code §
82-2-205)
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses. (2001 Code
§ 82-2-206)
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this article shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (2001 Code § 82-2-207; amd. §
8-9-2, Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on
January 6, 2020)
8-9A-3: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise
granted pursuant to this article, a provider shall have the following
obligations:
      1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review
an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, the
required fee as set forth by the city uniform fee schedule as a nonrefundable
application fee.
      2.   Franchise Fee: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or
Business License Tax enacted by the city.
      3.   Encroachment Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for
an encroachment permit as provided in section
8-8-3 of this title. (2001 Code § 82-2-301)
   B.   Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all
franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of
the close of each calendar month. (2001 Code § 82-2-302)
   C.   Fee Statement and Certification: Unless a franchise agreement provides
otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the
manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its
accuracy. (2001 Code § 82-2-303)
   D.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at
the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
article or a franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the
parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding
arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association. Any costs associated with any work to be done by the
public works department to provide space on city-owned poles shall be borne by
the provider. (2001 Code § 82-2-304)
   E.   Taxes and Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
article. (2001 Code § 82-2-305)
   F.   Interest on Late Payments: If any payment is not actually received by
the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest
thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for
delinquent state taxes. (2001 Code § 82-2-306)
   G.   No Accord and Satisfaction: No acceptance by the city of any fee shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim the city may have for additional sums payable. (2001 Code § 82-2-307)
   H.   Not in Lieu of Other Taxes or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment in
lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided in
this article, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, encroachment permit fees and fees to obtain space on the city-owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable. (2001 Code § 82-2-308)
   I.   Continuing Obligation and Holdover: If a provider continues to operate
all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such operator
shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this article and the
franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and other payment
provisions throughout the period of such continued operation; provided, that
any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other

ordinance, before commencing any work in the rights-of-way. (2001 Code § 82-2-
501)
   B.   Quality: All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair,
upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and
reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time,

within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or
quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, promptly correct all such conditions. (2001 Code § 82-2-502)

moving of such structure. A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any
person other than the city for any such movement of its systems.
      4.   Rights-of-Way Change; Obligation to Move System: When the city is
changing a right-of-way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the rights-of-way, without cost to the city, to
the extent provided in the encroachment ordinance. This obligation does not
apply to systems originally located on private property pursuant to a private
easement, which property was later incorporated into the rights-of-way, if that
private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether
or not the provider has obtained an encroachment permit. (2001 Code § 82-2-504)
   E.   Protection of Structures: In connection with the construction,
maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its

any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or any other
Municipal structure on, over or under the rights-of-way of the city required
because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration shall be made by the
city or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees that it shall
be liable for the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair and restore
to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified by the city,
any Municipal structure or any other rights-of-way of the city involved in the
construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system that may
become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of
a provider pursuant to the franchise. (2001 Code § 82-2-505)

comply with all applicable federal, state and local requirements, including,
but not limited to, the National Electrical Safety Code. (2001 Code § 82-2-507)
   H.   Repair: After reasonable written notice to the provider, unless, in the
sole determination of the city, an eminent danger exists, any rights-of-way
within the city which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be repaired by
the city at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing
before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the city shall submit to such a
provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the
rights-of-way intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the statement, pay to the city the entire amount thereof. (2001 Code
§ 82-2-508)
   I.   System Maintenance: A provider shall:
      1.   Install and maintain all parts of its system in a safe condition
throughout the entire period of its franchise.
      2.   Install and maintain its system in accordance with standard prudent
engineering practices and shall conform, when applicable, with the national
electrical safety code and all applicable other federal, state and local laws
or regulations.
      3.   At all reasonable times, permit examination by any duly authorized
representative of the city of the system and its effect on the rights-of-way.
(2001 Code § 82-5-509)
   J.   Trimming of Trees: A provider shall have the authority to trim trees,
in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement
restrictions, upon and hanging over rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches
of such trees from coming in contact with its system. (2001 Code § 82-2-510;
amd. § 8-9-5, Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12

      1.   PSC Approval: When a provider is the subject of a sale, transfer,
lease, assignment, sublease or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise,
such that it or its successor entity is obligated to inform or seek the
approval of the PSC, the provider or its successor entity shall promptly notify
the city of the nature of the transaction and, if applicable, request a
transfer of the franchise to the successor entity. A request for a transfer
shall include a certification that the successor entity unequivocally agrees to
all of the terms of the original provider's franchise agreement.
      2.   Transfer of Franchise: Upon receipt of a request to transfer a
franchise, the city designee, as provided in subsection
8-9A-8A1 of this article, may send notice approving the transfer of the
franchise to the successor entity. Such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If the city has reason to believe that the successor entity may not
comply with this article or the franchise agreement, it may require an
application for the transfer. The application shall comply with section
8-9A-4 of this article. (2001 Code § 82-2-601)
   B.   If PSC Approval No Longer Required: If the PSC no longer exists, or if
its regulations or state law no longer require approval of transactions
described in subsection A of this section, then the following events shall be
deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of the franchise requiring
compliance with subsection A of this section:
      1.   The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of a
provider's assets to another person;
      2.   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or
partnership, membership or other equity interests in a provider by one or more
of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to
create a new controlling interest in a provider;
      3.   The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership
or other equity interest by a provider so as to create a new controlling
interest in such a provider; or
      4.   The entry by a provider into an agreement with respect to the
management or operation of such provider or its system. (2001 Code § 82-2-602;
amd. § 8-9-6, Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12

franchise. (2001 Code § 82-2-701)
   B.   Oversight: The city shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
periodically inspect the construction, maintenance and upgrade of the system,
and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and
applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to
prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the city at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations. (2001 Code § 82-2-702)
   C.   Maintain Records: A provider shall at all times maintain:
      1.   On file with the city, a full and complete set of plans, records and
as built hard copy maps and, to the extent the maps are placed in an electronic
format, they shall be made in electronic format compatible with the city's
existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the types
of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights-of-way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks which shall include annotations of all rights-of-
way where work will be undertaken. As used in this section, as built maps
include file construction prints. Maps shall be drawn to scale. As built maps,
including the compatible electronic format, as provided in this subsection,
shall be submitted within thirty (30) days of completion of work or within
thirty (30) days after completion of modification and repairs. As built maps
are not required of the provider who is the incumbent local exchange carrier
for the existing system to the extent they do not exist.
      2.   Throughout the term of the franchise, a provider shall maintain
complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership,
and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the city at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the
franchise. Should the city reasonably determine that the records are not being
maintained in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance
with this subsection. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that
regulates utilities in the state, and generally accepted accounting principles,
shall be deemed to be acceptable under this section. (2001 Code § 82-2-703)
   D.   Confidentiality: If the information required to be submitted is
proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by federal, state or local
law, upon proper request by a provider, such information shall be classified as
a protected record within the meaning of the Utah Government Records Access and
Management Act (GRAMA), making it available only to those who must have access
to perform their duties on behalf of the city; provided, that a provider
notifies the city of, and clearly labels the information which a provider deems
to be confidential, proprietary information. Such notification and labeling
shall be the sole responsibility of the provider. (2001 Code § 82-2-704)

provided in this article or a franchise. (2001 Code § 82-2-705)
   F.   Right of Inspection: For the purpose of verifying the correct amount of
the franchise fee, the books and records of the provider pertaining thereto
shall be open to inspection or audit by duly authorized representatives of the
city at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records. The provider agrees to reimburse the
city the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit discloses that the provider
has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the compensation due the city for
the period of such audit. If the accounting rendered to the city by the
provider herein is found to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the
corrected amount within thirty (30) calendar days of written notice, it being
agreed that the city may accept any amount offered by the provider, but the
acceptance thereof by the city shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if
the amount is in dispute or is later found to be incorrect. (2001 Code § 82-2-
706; amd. § 8-9-7, Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at

expense, all aboveground portions of a system from the rights-of-way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall
not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good
faith.
      5.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this article, a provider may abandon any underground system in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights-
of-way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other
person. (2001 Code § 82-2-804)
   E.   Construed According to State Law: This article and any franchise

8-9B-1: DECLARATION OF FINDING AND INTENT:
   A.   Findings Regarding Rights-of-Way: The city finds that the public
rights-of-way within the city:
      1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the city;
      2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      3.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of wireless service
providers, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic
well-being of the city and its citizens; and
      4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way. This includes placing wires
and equipment inside poles and below ground.
   B.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the right to occupy
portions of the public rights-of-way for the business of providing wireless
services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that has been acquired
and is maintained at great expense to the city and its taxpayers, and,
therefore, the taxpayers of the city should receive fair and reasonable
compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
   C.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while wireless
facilities are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations
also involve public rights-of-way, municipal zoning, and vital business and
community service, which are of local concern. The city also finds that it has
the proprietary right to determine what persons and entities are granted
permission to use city rights-of-way, and to determine the reasonable and
nondiscriminatory terms and conditions of such use.
   D.   Finding Regarding Promotion of Wireless Services: The city finds that
it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the
development of wireless services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to
community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal,
educational and community services.
   E.   Findings Regarding Minimization of Impacts: The city finds that towers
and other supporting structures present aesthetic and land use concerns that
should be dealt with by encouraging collocation, and minimizing the number of
structures in a manner that does not discourage market access or competition.
   F.   Findings Regarding Master License Agreement Standards: The city finds
entering a master license agreement with providers:
      1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
      2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use valuable public property to serve the public;
      3.   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that
may flow from such commercial use of its public rights-of-way;
      4.   Protects the police powers and proprietary authority of the city
with respect to its rights-of-way, in a manner consistent with federal and
state law;
      5.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use
of the city infrastructure; and
      6.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the public
rights-of-way. (Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; amd. Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective
at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-9B-2: PURPOSE AND GOALS:
   A.   The purpose of this article is to establish requirements for the siting
and use of wireless facilities in public rights-of-way in a manner that
facilitates the delivery of wireless services within the city, while minimizing
associated adverse impacts. The goals of this article are to:
      1.   Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance,
modification, and removal of wireless services infrastructure in the city to
provide adequate wireless communications coverage, without unreasonably
discriminating against providers of functionally equivalent services including
all of those who install, maintain, and operate wireless facilities.
      2.   Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and
specifically, protecting aesthetic values, by reducing the visibility of
wireless facilities and structures to the fullest extent possible through
techniques including but not limited to camouflage/concealment, design
techniques, and undergrounding of wireless facilities and the equipment
associated therewith, where possible.
      3.   Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive wireless
facilities to supplement existing telecommunications facilities.
      4.   Encourage the location of structures in a manner that is least
intrusive to the community.
      5.   Encourage owners and users of antennas and structures to locate
them, to the extent possible, where the adverse impact on the community is
minimized.
      6.   Enhance the ability of providers to provide such wireless services
to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
      7.   Effectively manage wireless facilities in the public right-of-way.

   A.   This article shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of
wireless services and systems that require the use of public rights-of-way,
including providers of both the system and service, and those providers of the
system only.
   B.   The requirements set forth in this article shall apply to all wireless
facilities and structures located within public right-of-way, and to all
applications to locate or modify wireless facilities and structures within
public right-of-way. This article shall apply to all future providers and to
all providers in the city prior to the effective date hereof, whether operating
with or without a license. Title 13, chapter 16 of this code addresses wireless
telecommunications facilities in areas inside and outside of public rights-of-
way. (Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; amd. Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon
on January 6, 2020)
8-9B-4: LICENSE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE ROW:
   A.   Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, every provider
must obtain a site license for each wireless facility and structure to be
constructed or installed in the ROW. When a provider applies for a site
license, if the provider and the city have not already executed a Master
License Agreement, the city will provide the provider with a copy of the city's
standard master license agreement. The city will not issue any site licenses to
a provider until the provider and the city have executed a master license
agreement.
   B.   Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the Master
License Agreement, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such
services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   C.   The grant of a license to a provider will not excuse the provider from
obtaining: 1) any other permit or authorization required for the privilege of
transacting and carrying on a business within the city required by the
ordinances and laws of the city; 2) any other permit, agreement or
authorization required in connection with the use of property or facilities
owned by third parties; or 3) any encroachment permit or other permit or
authorization required in connection with excavating, encroaching, or
performing other work in or along the ROW. (Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; amd. Ord.
19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-9B-5: NATURE OF LICENSE:
   A.   A license granted hereunder will not convey title, equitable or legal,
in the ROW. A license is only the right to occupy ROW on a nonexclusive basis
for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the license; the
right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased except as may be expressly
provided in a master license agreement.
   B.   A provider's use of the ROW pursuant to a license granted hereunder,
shall be subject to the prior and continuing right of the city to use any and
all parts of the ROW exclusively or concurrently with any other person or
entity, and shall be further subject to all deeds, easements, dedications,
conditions, covenants, restrictions, encumbrances, and claims of title of
record which may affect the ROW. (Ord. 18-28, 8-22-2018; amd. Ord. 19-48, 12-
11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-9B-6: MASTER LICENSE AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Authority: The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive
licenses governing the installation, construction, operation, use and
maintenance of wireless facilities and structures in ROW, in accordance with
the provisions of this article. Any such licenses will be granted through a
master license agreement entered into between the city and provider, and
subsequent site licenses that apply and extend the terms of the master license
agreement to specific locations in the ROW.
   B.   Non-Discrimination: The city shall enter into master license agreements
with providers on a nondiscriminatory basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
city may negotiate additional or different terms with different providers, in
the exercise of the city's reasonable discretion and pursuant to the city's
reserved police powers and the city's proprietary rights in the ROW.
   C.   Term: master license agreements will be for a term of five (5) to
fifteen (15) years (the "term"), and shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory
manner. Site licenses will be for a term of the remainder of the current master
license agreement, and will be subject to all the terms and conditions of the
master license agreement in effect when the site license is granted.
   D.   Compensation: The master license agreement will require the provider to
pay fair and reasonable compensation to the city, as determined by the city
council, for: 1) the administrative expenses associated with entry into the
master license agreement and individual site licenses, 2) the provider's use of
ROW, including the city's expenses associated with maintenance and management
of the provider's use of ROW, and 3) other applicable fees. Specifically,
providers must pay the following fees:
      1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review
applications, providers shall pay a nonrefundable application fee for each
application for a site license or modification to a site license, as set forth
on the city's consolidated fee schedule as the same may be amended from time to
time. The application fee for collocating a small wireless facility on an
existing or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure shall be not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per collocation. The application fee
for installing, modifying, or replacing a utility pole in connection with a
permitted use shall be not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per
utility pole. The application fee for installing, modifying, or replacing a
utility pole in connection with a discretionary use shall be not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per utility pole. The application fee must be paid
at the time the application is submitted to the city.
      2.   Site License Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city of
inspecting and managing licensed wireless facilities, and to compensate the
city for the use of the ROW, the Master License Agreement will require
providers to pay an annual fee for each site license. The site license fee
shall not be more than the greater of: a) 3.5 percent of all gross revenue
related to the provider's use of ROW for small wireless facilities, or b) two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) annually for each small wireless facility. For
small wireless facilities collocated on city-owned utility poles, the site
license fee shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) annually. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no site license fee will be charged to a provider that is subject to
the Municipal Telecommunications License Tax, pursuant to Utah Code Annotated
section 10-1-401 et seq.
      3.   Other Fees: Providers must also pay all other applicable fees
established in this code, specifically including but not limited to fees for
encroachment permits and business licensing.
   E.   Insurance, Indemnity, and Security: Prior to the execution of master
license agreement, a provider must deposit with the city an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit or surety bond as required by the terms of the
master license agreement, and shall obtain and provide proof of the insurance
coverage required by the master license agreement. A provider shall also
indemnify the city as set forth in the master license agreement. (Ord. 18-28,
8-22-2018; amd. Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6,

provider must submit an application to the telecommunications application
specialist, on a form provided by the city. In addition to any information
required on that form, the application must include the following information:
      1.   The type of site license sought, e.g., collocation of small wireless
facility, collocation of large wireless facility, installation of new utility
pole, or installation of new wireless support structure. If the site license is
for a collocation, the application must designate the type of structure on
which the wireless facility will be mounted, e.g., existing utility pole or
wireless support structure, an existing city-owned utility pole, etc.
      2.   The location of the proposed wireless facility or structure,
including the designation of the proposed ROW as permitted or discretionary.
      3.   A scaled site plan, rendering or photo simulation, scaled elevation
view and other supporting drawings and calculations, showing the location and
dimension of all improvements. The submittal must include sufficient
information to determine compliance with the standards and requirements of this
article, specifically including information concerning structure height and
location within the ROW, compliance with the city's  intersection and driveway
sight distance standards, and compliance with the Americans With Disabilities
Act.
      4.   An industry-standard pole load analysis indicating that the
structure on which the wireless facilities will be mounted will safely support
the load.
   B.   Avoiding Redundant Submittals: The telecommunications application
specialist may allow a provider to maintain on file with the telecommunications
application specialist any documentation that would otherwise be required for
each individual application, such as basic wireless facility design documents
and pole load analyses. The provider must update any such information as
necessary to keep it current.
   C.   Site License Fee Exemption: If a provider desires to be exempted from
the site license fee, the provider must submit evidence that the provider is
subject to the Municipal Telecommunications License Tax pursuant to Utah Code
Annotated section 10-1-401 et seq.

CHAPTER 10
HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
SECTION:
8-10-1: Grading Standards
8-10-2: Preservation Of Existing Vegetation
8-10-3: Revegetation
8-10-1: GRADING STANDARDS:
Buildings and other improvements should be designed to fit the site and to
leave natural massing, topography, and natural features of the landscape
intact. The following standards are established in order to help meet this
goal:
   A.   Land Disturbance Permit Required: No grading, excavation, or tree/
vegetation removal shall be permitted, whether to provide for a building site
for on site utilities or services, or for any roads or driveways, prior to
issuance of a land disturbance permit issued by the city.
   B.   Cutting to Create Benches: Cutting and grading to create benches or
pads for larger building sites shall be avoided to the maximum extent feasible.
   C.   Limits on Changing Natural Grade: The original, natural grade of a lot
shall not be raised or lowered more than four feet (4') at any point for
construction of any structure or improvement, except:
      1.   The site's original grade may be raised or lowered six feet (6') if
a retaining wall is used to reduce the steepness of manmade slopes; provided,
that the retaining wall complies with the provisions of subsection G of this
section.
      2.   The site's original grade may be raised or lowered more than six
feet (6') with terracing, as specified in subsection G of this section.
   D.   Grading for Accessory Building Pads: Grading to create separate
building pads for accessory buildings and structures other than garages, such
as tennis courts, swimming pools, outbuildings, and similar facilities is
prohibited on natural slopes over twenty percent (20%).
   E.   Grading for Road Construction:
      1.   Topsoil on proposed road rights of way shall be removed prior to
establishing finished road grades, shall be stockpiled at the location
identified on the approved grading plan for use in revegetation, and shall be
redistributed on disturbed areas prior to revegetation.
      2.   Excess cut material resulting from road construction or utility
installation shall be removed from the site.
      3.   Where permanent roads or roadbeds are to be used during construction
and stormwater inlets have already been installed, such inlets shall be
protected to prevent sediment from entering the storm drainage system.
   F.   Limits on Graded or Filled Manmade Slopes:
      1.   The grade of manmade slopes shall not generally exceed twenty five
percent (25%).
      2.   In no case shall the grade of cut or fill slopes exceed fifty
percent (50%) unless it is substantiated, on the basis of a site investigation
and submittal of a soils engineering or geotechnical report prepared and
certified by a qualified professional, that a cut at a steeper slope will be
stable and will not create a hazard to public or private property.
      3.   All cut, filled and graded slopes shall be recontoured to blend into
the natural grade of surrounding land.
      4.   All permanent fills shall be constructed and stabilized to prevent
settlement, sliding, or erosion damage to streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks or
buildings.
   G.   Terracing and Retaining Walls: Use of retaining walls is encouraged to
reduce the steepness of manmade slopes and to provide planting pockets
conducive to revegetation.
      1.   Retaining walls may be permitted to support steep slopes but shall
not exceed six feet (6') in height measured from finished grade.
      2.   Terracing shall be limited to two (2) tiers. The width of the
terrace between any two (2) four foot (4') vertical retaining walls shall be at
least three feet (3'). Retaining walls higher than four feet (4') shall be
separated from any other retaining wall by a minimum distance of five (5)
horizontal feet. Terraces created between retaining walls shall be permanently
landscaped or revegetated.
      3.   Retainings walls shall be faced with stone or earth colored
materials similar to the surrounding natural landscape.
   H.   Repair of Disturbed Areas: All repair measures for disturbed areas
shall be made not later than thirty (30) days after the disturbance is made,
except revegetation, which shall take place at the earliest planting season
thereafter.
   I.   Stabilization and Maintenance: The developer, builder or property owner
shall provide interim stabilization of all disturbed areas during construction
and final stabilization once construction is completed. The developer, builder
or property owner may be held responsible for slope failure resulting from
defective workmanship or failure to follow approved plans. Upon taking
possession of such lots or common areas, subsequent property owners shall
maintain stabilization and erosion control. (2001 Code § 89-4-504; amd. 2009
Code; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-10-2: PRESERVATION OF EXISTING VEGETATION:
Existing concentrations of significant trees and vegetation shall be preserved.
For the purposes of this section, "significant trees and vegetation" means
trees of six inch (6") caliper or greater, groves of five (5) or more smaller
trees, or clumps of shrubs covering an area of fifty (50) square feet or more
measured at the drip lines. (2001 Code § 89-4-504; amd. 2009 Code)
8-10-3: REVEGETATION:
Any slope exposed or created in new development shall be landscaped or
revegetated with native or adapted trees and other native or adapted plant

   A.   Compliance with Master Plan: Stormwater shall be controlled and
directed in accordance with the city storm drain master plan to eliminate
potential damage and hazards to people and property within the city. (2001 Code
§ 90-3-101; amd. 2009 Code § 8-11-1; Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010)
   B.   Extensions and Connections Generally:
      1.   Payment of storm drain impact and other fees does not guarantee
existence of storm drain lines to the property boundaries where the storm drain
connection is to be made and does not relieve the developer, builder or
property owner of the responsibility to provide and maintain the necessary
storm drain improvements between the property requiring drainage and the
nearest defined natural drainage channel or other existing storm drain system
improvements. Prior to connecting to the city storm drain system, the
developer, builder or property owner shall be required to extend the then
existing city system to an appropriate connection location as determined by the
city engineer.
      2.   All storm drain improvements, extensions and connections shall be
constructed in accordance with the county flood control master plan, city
master plan, standards and specifications.
      3.   All permits necessary for discharging water into, crossing, or in
any other way impacting natural drainage channels, waterways, canals or rivers,
shall be issued and submitted to the city engineer prior to final development
or connection approval. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, the
preparation of a stormwater pollution prevention plan and notice of intent
required by the state. (2009 Code § 8-11-3; amd. Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010)

this chapter and provide, at its own expense, on site installations capable of
handling the stormwater runoff generated by, within and upstream of any real
property that is developed, graded or altered in any manner that affects
stormwater runoff upon, over, across or from such real property, including,
without limitation, the construction of structures or other increase of
impervious surface area. At a minimum, LID BMPs (where feasible) and detention
shall be provided to meet the stormwater management regulations as outlined in
the city's storm drain design standards.
      2.   Detention requirements may be met by connection to a city storm
drain facility for flag lots or subdivisions less than five (5) acres in size,
provided that a city storm drain facility exists, additional capacity is
available, the city engineer determines that connection is appropriate, and the
city receives payment in an amount determined by the city engineer. (2001 Code
§ 90-3-102; amd. 2009 Code § 8-11-4; Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010; Ord. 17-22, 4-26-
2017)
   D.   Temporary Storm Drain Structures:
      1.   Permitted: The city may allow temporary drainage solutions providing
for on site detention or retention that will allow development grading or
alteration of property requiring drainage, pending completion of the permanent
storm drainage improvements. The temporary solutions shall provide the same
level of flood protection at all times that will be provided by the completed
systems. All costs of temporary solutions shall be paid by the developer,
builder or property owner, in addition to the other costs and fees.
      2.   Required Facilities Determined by City: The city shall make the
determination of the required scope of temporary facilities or improvements
prior to the issuance of a building permit or development approval, whichever
first occurs.
      3.   Maintenance: The developer, builder and property owner shall be
responsible for maintenance and cleaning of the temporary storm drain facility.
This maintenance responsibility shall continue until such time as permanent or
alternate facilities are installed and approved by the city. The developer,
builder or property owner shall also, if required by the city, file with the
city a ten (10) year financial guarantee for maintenance, in a form acceptable
to the city, to guarantee proper maintenance of the facility. (2001 Code § 90-
3-105; amd. 2009 Code § 8-11-6; Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010)
   E.   Off Site Installations:
      1.   The developer, builder or property owner shall obtain, at its
expense, easements as are necessary for the installation of off site storm
drain improvements to ensure future access for operation, maintenance, repair
and removal. If the storm drain improvements are required by the city to be
public improvements and part of the city's storm drain system, a perpetual
easement shall also be dedicated to the city authorizing the city to operate,
maintain and repair the storm drain facilities so dedicated.
      2.   Storm drain facilities that are required by the city to be public
improvements, and that are dedicated to the city shall become the property of
the city upon written acceptance of the city. Only after such acceptance the
city shall operate and maintain the facilities or appurtenances. (2001 Code §
90-3-106; amd. 2009 Code § 8-11-7; Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010)
   F.   Storm Drain System in New Developments: For all new developments, the
developer shall install a storm drain system which is constructed in compliance
with the stormwater management regulations and the connection permit as
required by this chapter. If the city storm drain master plan shows a pipeline
larger than that required to serve the proposed development, the developer
shall comply with the master plan. (2001 Code § 87-5-111; amd. 2009 Code § 8-
11-8; Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on
January 6, 2020)
8-11-6: ILLICIT CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED:
   A.   Violation: It is a violation of this chapter for any person to make or
allow to be made, or use or allow to be used any connection to the city's storm
drain system without city approval.
   B.   Prohibited Connections: The construction, use, maintenance or continued
existence of illicit connections to the city's storm drain system is
prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection. No person shall act, cause, or permit any agent, employee, or
contractor to construct, maintain, operate or utilize an illicit connection, or
cause, allow or facilitate an illicit discharge. A person is considered to be
in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to
the city storm drain system, or allows such a connection to continue.
   C.   Discontinue Connection: A connection that violates this chapter shall
be addressed through a notice of violation and an emergency order issued and
processed under title 16 of this code. If, subsequent to eliminating a
connection found to be in violation of this chapter, the person can demonstrate
that an illicit discharge will no longer occur, said person may request
approval to reconnect. The reconnection or reinstallation of the connection
shall be at the city's discretion and shall be subject to such conditions as
the city may determine; such reconnection or reinstallation shall be at the
requesting person's sole expense. (2009 Code § 8-11-2; amd. Ord. 10-21, 7-28-
2010; Ord. 12-10, 4-25-2012, eff. 7-1-2012; Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective
at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-11-7: CONNECTION PERMIT:
   A.   Required for New and Modified Connections:
      1.   It is a violation of this chapter for any person to make or allow to
be made a new connection, or to modify or allow to be modified any existing
connection to the city's storm drain system without first obtaining a storm
drain connection permit from the city.
      2.   The requirement to obtain a connection permit applies to direct
connections to the storm drain system (e.g., a piped connection to a piped
portion of the storm drain system) and indirect connections to the storm drain
system (e.g., overland discharges to any part of the storm drain system). The
approval of the long term connection is different than a land disturbance
permit issued pursuant to title 11 of this code.
      3.   Connections from a detached single-family residence are exempt,
provided that the runoff from the residence is handled according to a plat or
site plan approved by the city. However, any person desiring to install a
basement pump, foundation drain, or other related fixture directly or
indirectly connecting to the storm drain system must obtain a connection
permit.
      4.   The connection permit shall run with the land and shall be binding
on the original property owners, applicants, and their respective heirs,
successors, and assigns. The city may, in the city's sole discretion, record
the connection permit or notice thereof at the office of the county recorder.
      5.   Connections made by the city are exempt from the connection permit
requirement.
   B.   Timing: Any person beginning any type of construction requiring a
building permit shall obtain a storm drain connection permit before or
concurrent with the building permit. If site plan or subdivision approval is
sought, the application for a storm drain connection permit shall be submitted
with the earlier of the submittal for final site plan or final subdivision
approval and shall be issued prior to or concurrent with the final approval.
   C.   Requirements of Connection Permit Application:
      1.   Required: Each person desiring to connect to the city's storm drain
system or to modify an existing connection shall submit an application to the
city for a storm drain connection permit.
      2.   BMP Plan: A Best Management Practices plan shall be submitted with
the application and shall designate specific BMPs that the applicant will use
to regulate, control, and facilitate discharges as specified in the city's
storm drain design standards. The BMP plan shall be incorporated in the
connection permit. All BMP plans shall provide for pretreatment of discharge
unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that
pretreatment is not necessary because of: a) lack of potential pollutants in
the discharge from the site, and b) insufficient quantity of discharge from the
site.
         a.   The BMPs shall be designed to ensure that the quality and
quantity discharge to the city's storm drain system meet the stormwater
management regulations. The BMPs shall ensure that the quality of receiving
water is not degraded by stormwater runoff and that the quantity of discharge
does not exceed the designed capacity, or jeopardize the integrity of the storm
drain system.
         b.   The BMPs may be structural or nonstructural, depending on the
needs of the site. The proposed BMPs shall be designed specifically for a given
site; provided that, if the  city has established preapproved BMPs, the
preapproved BMPs shall be used.
         c.   City shall not issue a storm drain connection permit until the
BMP plan has been submitted to and accepted by the city.
      3.   Maintenance Plan: For storm drain improvements and postconstruction
BMPs located on private property and not dedicated to the city, a maintenance
plan shall be submitted to the city outlining how the storm drain improvements
and postconstruction BMPs will be maintained to ensure the upkeep of the
connection and on site storm drain improvements. The maintenance plan shall be
incorporated in the connection permit. Provisions for the periodic review and
evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance program and the need for
revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan
and shall be part of the connection permit. At a minimum, the maintenance plan
shall contain the following provisions:
         a.   The name(s) of the owner(s) for all components of the storm drain
facilities;
         b.   The name(s) and address(es) of the person or persons responsible
for maintenance;
         c.   The person(s) responsible for financing maintenance and emergency
repairs;
         d.   A maintenance schedule and record keeping requirements for all
storm drain improvements and postconstruction BMPs, including, but not limited
to, swales, separators, pipes and ponds;
         e.   A list of easements with the purpose and location of each; and
         f.   The signature(s) of the property owner(s).
      4.   Engineering Plans: Engineering plans, stamped by an engineer
registered in the State of Utah, shall be submitted to the city showing
permanent storm drain improvements and the connection to the city system. City
shall not issue a connection permit until the plans are submitted to the city,
city comments have been addressed, and the city has accepted the engineering
plans.
      5.   Fees: The applicant for a connection permit shall pay a fee as
adopted by resolution of the city council.
   D.   Approval of Connection Permit: When deciding whether to approve,
conditionally approve, or not approve a connection permit, the following
factors may be considered:
      1.   Connection will only be allowed for stormwater, surface drainage,
subsurface drainage, groundwater, irrigation tail water, roof runoff and
cooling water. Such water may be discharged only into the storm drain system
that has adequate capacity for the accommodation of such water. Such discharged
water shall comply with the stormwater management regulations.
      2.   Whether the requested connection complies with the stormwater
management regulations.
      3.   Whether the requested connection complies with the storm drain
master plan.
      4.   Whether the BMP plan, maintenance plan, and engineering plans have
been submitted, city comments have been addressed, and city has accepted the
plans.
      5.   Whether the proposed connection introduces or will potentially
introduce pollutants into the storm drain system.
      6.   Whether the proposed connection creates a safety hazard.
      7.   Whether the proposed connection affects the integrity of the storm
drain system infrastructure.
      8.   Whether the proposed connection endangers the city's drinking water.
   E.   Compliance with Plans: Failure to construct or maintain the stormwater
improvements in accordance with the accepted plans (including the BMP plan, the
maintenance plan, and engineering plans) shall be a violation of the connection
permit and this chapter.
   F.   As Builts: Any person connecting to the storm drain system shall
provide "as built" plans showing the details and the location of the
connection. The plans shall be in a format that is acceptable to the city
engineer. (Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010; amd. Ord. 17-22, 4-26-2017; Ord. 19-48, 12-

   C.   Records Review: The city may demand the production of such records as
necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter and for
the purpose of examination and copying.
   D.   Sample and Test:
      1.   For the purpose of determining the potential for contribution of
pollutants to the storm drain system, the city may inspect, sample and test any
of the following: area runoff; soils within the source property; liquids,
discharge, or materials within any storage area (including any container
contents); and treatment system discharge.
      2.   The city may investigate the structural integrity and condition of
all new and existing storm drains, sanitary sewer facilities/systems or other
tanks, reservoirs or pipelines on the property using appropriate tests,
including, but not limited to, smoke and dye tests and video surveys. The
city's authorized representative may take photographs or videotape, make
measurements or drawings, and create any other record reasonably necessary to
document conditions on the property.
      3.   The responsible person shall provide copies of test results to the
city and, on submission of a written request to the city, be entitled to a copy
of the test results conducted by the city.
   E.   Monitoring:
      1.   For the purpose of measuring any discharge or potential source of
discharge to the storm drain system, the city may undertake a monitoring
program and other analysis, which may include both the installation and
maintenance of monitoring devices.
      2.   Whenever the city determines that there is any illicit discharge to
the storm drain system, the city may, by written notice, order that the
responsible person undertake such monitoring activities or analyses and furnish
such reports as the city may recommend. The written notice shall be served
either in person or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
and shall set forth the basis for such order and shall particularly describe
the monitoring activities and analyses and reports required. The responsible
person shall be responsible for the costs of these activities, analysis and
reports. The recipient of such order shall undertake and provide the
monitoring, analyses and reports within the time frames set forth in the order.
      3.   In the event that a responsible person fails to conduct the
monitoring and analyses and furnish the reports required by the order in the
time frames set forth therein, the city may cause such monitoring and analyses
to occur and assess all costs incurred, including reasonable administrative
costs and attorney fees, to the responsible person. The city may pursue
judicial action to enforce the order and recover all costs incurred.
   F.   Right to Enter to Inspect, Monitor and Test:
      1.   New Facility or Connection: When any new stormwater management
facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made
between private property and the city's storm drain system, the property owner
shall grant to the city the right to enter the private property at reasonable
times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes
the right to enter the property for compliance assessments and when the city
has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this chapter is occurring
or has occurred and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance
or correction of a violation of this chapter.
      2.   Notice of Entry: Upon presenting identification and an oral request
to enter made to any person who appears to be in possession or control of any
operation, business or real property, or where no such person is present, after
a written request to enter is mailed, personally delivered, or faxed to a
responsible person, the city has the right to, and is hereby granted the power
and right to, enter onto the exterior/out of doors (or areas not being within a
fully enclosed structure) of private property within the city solely for the
purpose to inspect, monitor or investigate the possible or potential source of
an illicit discharge to the storm drain system or watercourses. Except for
occupied residential property, such right to enter shall be exercisable at any
time. For an occupied residential property, such entry shall be made only
during daylight hours.
      3.   Industrial Activity: The city shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with
this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the city. Facility operators shall allow the city ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of a
UPDES permit, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state
and federal law.
      4.   Unreasonable Delays: Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access
to a permitted facility is a violation of any storm drain connection permit and
this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a UPDES permit
associated with industrial activity is in violation of this chapter if the
person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      5.   Obstructions: Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and
easy access to the facility to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      6.   Search Warrants: If the city has been refused access to a building,
structure, property or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect, monitor or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or
any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of an
administrative inspection or criminal search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
   G.   Correction of Deficiencies: Any maintenance and repair deficiencies
shall be corrected within such time period as is determined to be reasonable by
the city, and the inspection and maintenance requirements may be increased as
deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management
facility. Additional inspections may be required as determined to be
appropriate by the city. (Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010; amd. Ord. 16-39, 9-21-2016;
Ord. 19-48, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
8-11-13: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Remedies: This chapter may be enforced by administrative enforcement
under title 16 of this Code or criminal actions as provided by law. The city
has sole discretion to decide whether to proceed administratively or through
criminal process, or both, for a violation. If the city chooses to pursue both
administrative and criminal enforcement for the same violation, no court
imposed civil penalties may be assessed, but all other remedies are available.
   B.   Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance: In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public
health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be
summarily abated or restored at the responsible person's expense through an
administrative enforcement process, or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or
otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
   C.   Notice of Violation: Whenever an enforcement official finds that there
has been a violation or failure to meet a requirement of this chapter, the
enforcement official may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person.
      1.   Such notice may require without limitation: a) the performance of
monitoring, analyses, and reporting; b) the elimination of illicit connections
or discharges; c) that violating discharges, practices, or operations shall
cease and desist; d) the abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and e) the
implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
      2.   If abatement of a violation or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the responsible person fail to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a
contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the responsible person.
      3.   Failure to comply with an emergency order and/or a notice of
violation shall constitute a separate violation.
   D.   Cease and Desist Order: Whenever an administrative hearing officer
finds that there has been a violation or failure to meet a requirement of this
chapter, or the administrative hearing officer determines that a responsible
person's past violations are likely to recur, the administrative hearing
officer may order the responsible person to cease and desist all such
violations and direct the responsible party to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations, implementing additional BMPs, and terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any
other action against the responsible party.
   E.   Criminal Prosecution: The violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be a Class C misdemeanor. Each day that a violation occurs shall
constitute a separate offense.
   F.   Additional Sanctions Against Corporation or Association:
      1.   When a corporation or association is found to have violated any of
the provisions of this chapter, the administrative hearing officer or court
may, in addition to or in lieu of imposing other authorized penalties, require
the corporation or association to give appropriate publicity of the conviction
by notice to the class or classes of persons or sections of the public
interested in or affected by the conviction, by advertising in designated
areas, or by designated media or otherwise.
      2.   When an executive or high managerial officer of a corporation or
association is found to have violated any of the provisions of this chapter,
committed in furtherance of the affairs of the corporation or association, the
administrative hearing officer or court may disqualify him or her from
exercising similar functions in the same or other corporations or associations
for a period not exceeding five (5) years if it finds the scope or willfulness
of his illegal actions make it dangerous or inadvisable for such functions to
be entrusted to him.
   G.   Cost of Abatement: After abatement of a violation, the property owner
will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment as provided in title 16 of this code. If the amount due is not paid
within a timely manner as determined by the city or by the expiration of the
time provided in which to challenge the cost assessment, the cost assessment
shall be processed as a lien against the property for the amount of the
assessment.
   H.   Cost of Enforcement: The city may recover all attorney fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement of this chapter, including
sampling and monitoring costs.
   I.   Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a
person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the
city may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the
person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
   J.   Emergency Suspensions: The city administrator or designee may order the
immediate suspension or shutoff of a responsible person's discharge or storm
drain system access according to the provisions of title 16, chapter 2, article
B of this code whenever such suspension or shutoff is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears or presents or
causes a risk of an imminent or substantial:
      1.   Damage to the storm drain system or harm to the receiving waters;
      2.   Endangerment to the health, safety or welfare of any residents
served by the storm drain system;
      3.   Interference with the operation of the storm drain system;
      4.   Violation of the UPDES permit number UTS000001;
      5.   Endangerment to the environment.
Any responsible person notified of a suspension of its discharge privilege
shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution or discharge. In the event
of a responsible person's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the authorized enforcement official may take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the storm drain system
connection, to enforce such order. The authorized enforcement official shall
allow the responsible person to recommence its discharge when the responsible
person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the authorized enforcement
official that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings set forth in subsection K of this section are initiated against the
responsible person. A responsible person that is responsible in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment, shall submit to the
city administrator a detailed written statement describing the cause of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence,
prior to the date of any termination of discharge hearing under subsection K of
this section. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   K.   Revocation of Storm Drain Connection Permit: Violation by the holder of
a storm drain connection permit of any of the provisions thereof, or any of the
provisions of this chapter, shall be grounds for termination and revocation of
such permit by the city. Such termination or revocation shall be processed
through the procedures of title 16 of this code.
   L.   Removal of Obstructions: In addition to any penalties which may be
imposed pursuant to this chapter, the city may do the following:

devices installed in violation of the provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Bring an action for the abatement of the nuisance caused by the
offending installation and for the recovery of the city's costs and expenses
incurred in removing the offending installation pursuant to this section.
   M.   Remedies Not Exclusive: The remedies listed in this chapter are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state
or local law and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative
remedies. (Ord. 10-21, 7-28-2010; Ord. 12-10, 4-25-2012, eff. 7-1-2012; Ord.

characterization of the terms which cannot be resolved informally, the mayor
shall request the county attorney to review the issue and promptly provide

language as to the disputed terms using his or her independent legal judgment,

the property, nor may it deny service to a property based on delinquencies of a
prior owner.
   C.   Food Service And Other Specialty Enterprises: Any food service
enterprise or other enterprise requiring special reporting of water or sewer
usage to a water treatment facility, must have a separate meter measuring its
water use and a separate account with the City. (2001 Code § 90-1-105; amd.
2009 Code; Ord. 10-24, 8-25-2010)
9-2A-4: FREQUENCY OF METER READINGS:

frequency with which meters will be read. The frequency may be based on size,
type and class of service, and other fair and equitable criteria, giving due
consideration to the efficiency and economy of the operation of the utility as

   B.   When meters are read after a period greater than 39 days, the measured
water service determined by such readings shall be allocated to each month
included in the period of time covered by the reading upon the assumption that
water was consumed at an equal and unvarying rate throughout the period of time
covered, and the rate shall be computed for the service allocated to each month
on that basis. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 19-05, 1-23-2019; Ord. 20-03, 2-26-2020)
9-2A-5: SERVICE FEES:
   A.   Multiple Units: The billings for multiple-unit residential units shall
be based upon the number of units, living areas or mobile home lots actually
contained within the residential complex, regardless of whether or not such
unit, living area or lot is actually occupied. In addition to the charges
provided for in this section, each residential, multi-unit residential, strip
mall, commercial, industrial or manufacturing unit shall pay the surcharges and
shall comply with the discharge limitations contained in this title.
   B.   Sewer Discharge: Those users obtaining culinary water service from the
City owned culinary water system shall be presumed to discharge into the City
owned sanitary sewer system a volume of sewage effluent equal to the quantity
of water so obtained, except as provided in this subsection and except as
provided in subsection D of this section. The Chief Administrative Officer
shall, at least annually, calculate the average winter monthly usage of each
user whose culinary water meter is not read on a monthly basis during the
winters. Nonresidential users having their own water supply shall forthwith
install and maintain a sewage flow meter of an appropriate size and quality as
determined by the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee, and such user
shall pay such fees for his discharge into the system as required by subsection
A of this section.
   C.   Determining, Billing And Collecting Charges: The Finance Director may
implement appropriate procedures to determine, bill and collect the service
charges. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the monthly
service charge describes, as nearly as practical, a thirty (30) day usage and
billing cycle. For sewer service provided for less than a complete month, the
Finance Director shall prorate the monthly service fee to reflect the charges
for service actually provided during the period of service.
   D.   Manufacturing, Industrial User: The Chief Administrative Officer or his
designee, upon application of a manufacturing or industrial user (paying the
service fees as required in this section) and upon a reasonable showing that,
as a result of a particularly unique manufacturing or industrial usage of
water, the quantity of culinary water furnished by the City or by the user from
his own sources to that operation is significantly more than the quantity of
sewage introduced into the City sewer system, shall reduce the charges to such
manufacturing or industrial use so that such sewer charges will be in the same
proportion to the sewer discharge. Application for such determination shall be
in writing and shall contain such information as the Chief Administrative
Officer shall deem necessary to make such determination. The determination and
the resulting adjustment in the sewer charges shall be appealable to the City
Council. The determination shall be reviewed by the Chief Administrative
Officer or his designee at least annually. The user shall, within fifteen (15)
days, report in writing to the Chief Administrative Officer any change in the
function of the facility whereby there is introduced into the system a quantity
of wastewater greater than was authorized; and if the change was not reported,
the user shall pay the full sewer usage fee (based upon culinary water
purchased) for the entire period since the last determination and fee
adjustment were made. The granting of a charge reduction pursuant to these
provisions shall not be construed to grant any vested right or entitlement to
pay a reduced rate. The provisions of this section may be withdrawn by the City
Council at any time. (2001 Code § 90-2-104; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 19-05, 1-23-
2019)

   B.   Payment Due; Delinquency: Payment shall be due on the due date stated
in the bill, and the account shall be deemed delinquent if payment is not
received on or before the due date. Any balance unpaid after the specified due
date will incur a monthly finance charge at a rate of one and one-half percent
(1.5%) (annual percentage rate of 18 percent). Accounts unpaid for more than
two (2) consecutive billing periods after the due date may be referred for
collection and may be subject to subsequent collection fees up to thirty five
percent (35%) of the total unpaid balance.
   C.   Time To Dispute: Utility service billings produced and sent out by the
City shall be deemed to be correct if they are not disputed by the account
owner within sixty (60) days from the issuance thereof.
   D.   Partial Payments: Partial payments (payments that do not satisfy the
full amount due for all utilities that have been provided to the service
address) received shall be applied in the following order according to services
rendered for the utility account:
      1.   First, to fund any required deposit;
      2.   Second, to the payment of accrued interest, penalties and fees, if
any;
      3.   Third, to the payment of unpaid street lighting fees, if any;
      4.   Fourth, to the payment of unpaid stormwater fees, if any;
      5.   Fifth, to the payment of unpaid sanitary sewer fees, if any;
      6.   Sixth, to the payment of unpaid solid waste collection fees, if any;
and
      7.   Last, any remaining balance of the partial payment will then be
applied to the water fee.
   E.   Extended Payment Period: The Chief Administrative Officer or designee
may negotiate an extended payment period with the property owner for the
payment of overdue utility accounts, including the payment of penalties and
interest as provided in this section, provided such payment period shall not
exceed one year. One payment arrangement is allowed per utility account per
calendar year.
   F.   Billing Address: The property will be billed at the property owner’s
mailing address, which shall be provided to the City at the time of application
and periodically updated by the owner as necessary. Failure to provide a
correct and updated billing address for the property owner may result in a
shutoff of service at the service address and the incurrence of service fees.
   G.   Property Managers: A property owner may elect to have a property
management company receive City utility service bills on the property owner’s
behalf. To do so, the City must be provided with a signed and current property
management agreement or another form of written agent authorization. Although
the City may agree to send its utility service bills to such a property
manager, such action will not relieve the property owner of the primary
responsibility to pay such bills timely and in full.
   H.   Failure To Receive Billing: Failure to receive a utility service
billing will not relieve a property owner of the responsibility for payment of
said bill within the prescribed period, nor exempt any property owner from
penalties or interest for delinquent accounts. (2001 Code § 90-1-106; amd. 2009
Code; Ord. 09-18, 6-23-2009; Ord. 10-24, 8-25-2010; Ord. 19-05, 1-23-2019; Ord.

9-2A-7: DISCONTINUANCE OF UTILITIES:
   A.   Discontinuance Of Utilities For Nonpayment: Subject to the conditions
contained in this section, the City may discontinue services by any means
necessary, including the disconnecting of water service and retrieval of solid
waste containers, for:
      1.   Non-Payment:  Any account that has a delinquent balance for more
than two (2) consecutive billing periods and totaling one hundred twenty five
dollars ($125.00) or more, if said balance has remained unpaid by the final due
date provided by notice.
      2.   Lack of Required Documents:  Any account or service address that
does not have the required documents on file as required under section
9-2A-2.
   B.   Service Fee: Prior to reestablishing service at a service location
where the utility service was discontinued, the Chief Administrative Officer
shall assess and collect a service fee, as required by an adopted resolution of
the City Council, in addition to the full amount owing for service to those
premises.
   C.   Notice: Prior to discontinuing service, the Finance Director or
designee shall notify the property owner that the account is delinquent or is
lacking required documents and that the City intends to discontinue service for
one of those reasons. The notice shall be mailed to the property owner at the
service address or an alternate mailing address, if provided. The notice shall
be in a format to attract attention and shall: 1) state the proposed action; 2)
state the reasons for such action; and 3) inform the property owner of the
right to request a hearing.
   D.   Time Of Discontinuing Services: No service shall be discontinued until
after passage of ten (10) calendar days following mailing of the notice or, if
a hearing pursuant to Title 16 is requested, until the announcement of the
decision rendered as a result of such hearing.
   E.   Payments Accepted: Payment of the total unpaid balance of a delinquent
account shall be accepted by the Finance Director or designee at any time
during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, eight o’clock (8:00) A.M.
to five o’clock (5:00) P.M., except holidays, and discontinuance shall be
suspended pending verification of valid payment. Upon discovery that payment is
not valid, the utilities for the account shall be discontinued, and shall not
resume until the entire unpaid balance, including penalties and interest, the
returned payment fee, the service fee, and, if appropriate, the bad credit risk
security deposit specified in section
9-2A-10 of this article, are paid by guaranteed funds.
   F.   Returned Payment Fee: In addition to any other penalties and fees
specified in this title, the Finance Director shall assess and collect a
returned payment fee if payment made by check, ACH or automatic withdrawal is
not paid by the issuer’s bank for any reason. The fee imposed by this section
shall not prevent the imposition of any other penalty, fee or cost, including
criminal prosecution, assessed or imposed by law for making payments dishonored
by the issuer’s bank.
   G.   Separate Civil Litigation: Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the right of the City to pursue separate civil litigation to collect
any debt owing for services provided under this title.
   H.   Discontinuance of Service At Request Of Property Owner: A property
owner may request in writing that service be discontinued as to a particular
property; provided however, that all due and unpaid fees and charges for that
account must be paid in full, including a prorated amount if the discontinuance
of water service is requested in the middle of a meter reading/billing cycle;
and provided further that discontinuance of water service and cessation of
billing responsibility will take place upon physical disconnection of the water
by City personnel, which may not take place until twenty four (24) to forty
eight (48) hours following the receipt of the property owner’s request for
discontinuance of water service. (2001 Code § 90-1-107; amd. 2009 Code; Ord.
09-18, 6-23-2009; Ord. 20-03, 2-26-2020)
9-2A-8: SERVICE RESTORATION; FEES AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Discontinued utility services shall not be restored unless, and until:
1) the account balance is paid in full; 2) the fees for discontinuing or
limiting service and resuming service are paid in full, including, but not
limited to, the fee for reinstalling any water meter that has been removed for
purposes of discontinuing service; 3) all interest, penalties and fees are paid
in full; 4) required deposits, if any, have been provided; and an application
or contract is currently on file in the Finance Department.
   B.   In the event an owner or occupant makes an unauthorized, illegal water
connection by bypassing a meter box, a fee shall be assessed for reconnection,
and collected in addition to all other fees, charges and penalties. The City
may seek any civil or criminal remedies permitted by law against any person who
makes an unauthorized or illegal connection, including, without limitation,
recovery of damages for City property that is destroyed or damaged by such
action.
   C.   In the event an owner or occupant makes use of a solid waste container
assigned to another address during the time the service has been discontinued,
a fee set by resolution by the City Council may be assessed before restoration
of services, and collected in addition to all other fees, charges, and
penalties. The City may seek any civil or criminal remedies permitted by law
against any owner or occupant who:
      1.   Uses a solid waste container that is not assigned to the owner’s
address, and does so without permission from the account holder of the solid
waste container; or
      2.   Places their solid waste container in any place other than in front
of the proper account holder’s residence without permission, including in front
of a neighbor’s home, for the purposes of avoiding the discontinuation of solid
waste collection services or the retrieval of the solid waste container. Proof
that such actions were precipitated “for the purposes of avoiding the
discontinuation of solid waste collection services or the retrieval of the
solid waste container” if the action occurs two consecutive weeks or more than
a total of three weeks within a month. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 20-03, 2-26-2020)
9-2A-9: SECURITY DEPOSIT FOR BANKRUPTCY ACCOUNTS:
   A.   The Chief Administrative Officer or designee shall not alter, refuse or
discontinue service to or discriminate against the bankruptcy trustee or the
debtor receiving City provided utility service solely on the basis that a debt
owed by the debtor to the City for such services rendered before the entry of
the Bankruptcy Court's final order of relief was not paid when due.
   B.   Within twenty (20) days after the date of the bankruptcy filing, the
bankruptcy trustee or the debtor shall furnish adequate assurance of payment,
in the form of a deposit or other security, for service after such date or all
utility services will be terminated. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of
this title, failure to provide such deposit or security shall result in
immediate termination of service.
   C.   The required deposit amount shall be as adopted by resolution of the
City Council and shall be retained by the City for a period not to exceed two
(2) years after the bankruptcy relief date or until service is terminated. Any
accrued charges unpaid upon termination shall first be deducted from the
account prior to any balance being refunded.
   D.   The amount of the deposit may be modified upon order of the Federal
Bankruptcy Court, upon request of the property owner and after notice and a
hearing, pursuant to section 366(b) of the Bankruptcy Act. These provisions
shall not be construed to conflict with any provisions of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act or any court order under such Act.
   E.   If payment for future utility service becomes delinquent for over
thirty (30) days, the Chief Administrative Officer or designee may withdraw an
amount from the bankruptcy deposit as is necessary to abate the delinquency. If
the delinquency exceeds the balance of the bankruptcy deposit, the Chief
Administrative Officer may discontinue services in accordance with this title.
If discontinued, service shall be restored in accordance with the service
restoration provisions of this title. (2001 Code § 90-1-108; amd. 2009 Code;
Ord. 19-05, 1-23-2019; Ord. 20-03, 2-26-2020)
9-2A-10: SECURITY DEPOSIT FOR BAD CREDIT RISK ACCOUNTS:
   A.   The Chief Administrative Officer or designee may require a deposit as
adopted by resolution of the City Council for residential and nonresidential
accounts, which are "bad credit risk accounts", as defined in subsection B of
this section.
   B.   For the purposes of this section, "bad credit risk accounts" are those
accounts:
      1.   When service has been terminated for delinquent payment two (2) or
more times within any twelve (12) month period; or
      2.   For which payment for services rendered is made by a check,
automatic withdrawal, or ACH which is not paid by the bank upon first
presentment, twice within any twelve (12) month period.
   C.   The transfer of the account to the name of another individual shall not
operate to waive the required deposit, except in the case of new property
ownership, which shall require document proof of new ownership.
   D.   The deposit required under subsection A of this section shall be held
until service is terminated. Upon termination, any unpaid balance shall be
deducted from the deposit, and the remainder of the deposit shall be refunded.
If, after the deposit is submitted, the account remains in good standing for
twenty four (24) consecutive months, the deposit may, at the property owner’s
request, be refunded, less any unpaid balance. For purposes  of this section,
an account in good standing shall be an account for which utilities have not
been discontinued for delinquency.
   E.   The Finance Director or designee may, in order to avoid undue hardship,
allow the deposit to be paid in installments, provided such installment period
does not exceed three (3) months and provided there are not violations
occurring during the installment payment period. (2001 Code § 90-1-109; amd.
2009 Code; Ord. 19-05, 1-23-2019; Ord. 20-03, 2-26-2020)
9-2A-11: WATER METERS:
   A.   Water Bills Rely On Metered Usage Or Reasonable Estimates: All water
use and related services, whenever practical, shall be billed as a result of
metered usage. When metering or meter reading is not feasible, water use shall
be billed as a result of estimated water usage using historical information or
standard formulas to determine water requirements of similar property units.
   B.   Strip Malls Or Commonly Developed Commercial Buildings: Each unit in a
strip mall or commonly developed commercial buildings shall be separately
metered.
   C.   City Owns All Meters: All water meters measuring water flow from a City
main are the property of the City and the City is responsible to maintain these
meters.
   D.   Meters In Closets Or Other Inside Locations: Notwithstanding subsection
C of this section, if a developer or customer places a water meter inside of a
building, then although the City will read such a meter for purposes of billing
for water use and related services, the City disclaims any repair or
maintenance responsibility for such meter, and the property owner shall be
solely responsible for maintenance, repair and replacement of such a meter; and
the property owner shall be solely responsible for any and all consequential
damages arising from any delay in getting water shut off because of the
location of the meter and related valves. To permit meter reading and access to
the meter, the City must be provided with all necessary keys or codes to enter
the premises and locate the meter. Any replacement of such an inside meter must
be approved and inspected by the City to assure that the register on the meter
is readable by the City.
   E.   Access Easements: If a water meter is located anywhere other than in a
City owned public right-of-way or utility strip, the City shall be granted an
access easement by plat or otherwise to facilitate meter reading and
maintenance.
   F.   Installing Water Meters: The City will install all single- family and
similar residential water meters (less than 1 inch), and all three-fourths inch
(3/4") and one inch (1") commercial meters. The developer shall install any
water meter larger than one inch (1") in accordance with City requirements, and
the developer will be responsible for the water meters through the warranty
period. The water meters will be inspected by City staff at appropriate times,
prior to various releases and issuance of permits. If the meter is missing or
damaged, the responsible party shall replace or repair the meter. (Ord. 10-24,

9-3-1: SHORT TITLE:
The ordinance codified herein shall be known as the NO FAULT UTILITIES CLAIMS
ORDINANCE. (2001 Code § 90-6-101)
9-3-2: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to adopt a program to compensate persons for
loss sustained as the result of a break or backup in a city owned and
maintained water main or sanitary sewer line. City payments will be made
regardless of city fault and as a cost of operating these enterprise functions,
but subject to strict policy limitations and within budgeted appropriations.
(2001 Code § 90-6-102)
9-3-3: NO FAULT PAYMENT OF CLEANUP AND DAMAGES:
   A.   Damage From City Owned Water Or Sanitary Sewer Lines: The city shall
pay, from funds generated from fees and charges made for water and sanitary
sewer services, the reasonable and actual expenses for damages and costs to
clean up, sanitize and repair property damaged or destroyed, when such loss or
expense is directly and proximately caused by breakage or backup of a city
owned and maintained culinary water line or sanitary sewer line. Such payments
or services will be made without regard to proving city negligence or fault;
however, any such payment or city obligation is subject to: 1) the
restrictions, limitations and the other provisions of this chapter; 2)
unencumbered and appropriated funds existing in the city's applicable fiscal
year budget to satisfy the proved claim; and 3) execution of a full release,
approved by the city attorney, whereunder the applicants waive, release and
covenant not to sue the city or any of its officers, employees or agents
regarding the incident which resulted in the application or claim for damage
reimbursement by the city.
   B.   Damage From Unconnected Private Sewer Lines: Under the same terms and
conditions of this chapter and as specifically provided in subsection A of this
section, the city shall pay for the reasonable and actual cost of connecting
private sanitary sewer lines to the city main line, but only if the applicant
reasonably establishes that: 1) the original private sanitary sewer line was
never lawfully connected to the city sewer main line; and 2) a certification of
occupancy was issued by the city for the structure served by that private
sanitary sewer line. However, any city no fault obligation or payment for this
private line circumstance is strictly limited to payment for the actual and
reasonable excavation and other expenses directly and proximately necessary to
extend the preexisting private sewer line and connect it to the city sewer
system. No payment right or city obligation is established by this chapter and
no payments shall be made: 1) if the building or structure was otherwise
lawfully connected to an alternative sewer system, such as a septic tank or to
another jurisdiction's sewer system; or 2) for those elements of damages or
costs, including preexisting pipe replacement expenses, which are not directly
and proximately occasioned by the preexisting private sewer line's failure to
have been originally connected to the city sewer system.
   C.   No Fault Optional; Release Of Right To Sue Required: The city's no
fault program, provided in this chapter, shall not affect any rights of any
person to alternatively seek redress or damages on the basis of negligence,
fault or other applicable legal recourse, permitted under state or federal law.
However, any city no fault payment under this chapter shall only be made based
on a waiver, release and be in lieu of all other claims regarding the incident.
(2001 Code § 90-6-103)
9-3-4: ADMINISTRATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULATIONS:
The Chief Executive Officer may establish, consistent with City ordinances and
resolutions, reasonable regulations and procedures sufficient to provide for
the efficient handling of such claims and disbursement of appropriated funds
for payment of claims, under the provisions and limitations of this chapter.

9-3-5: REIMBURSEMENT; APPLICATION; TIME LIMITATIONS:
All applications or claims for reimbursement under this chapter must be

occurs or applicant knew, or reasonably should have known, a covered loss
existed, commencing with the City 2005-2006 fiscal year on July 1, 2005. (2001
Code § 90-6-201)
9-3-6: APPLICATION INVESTIGATION AND RECOMMENDATION:
Applications or claims received by the City Clerk/Recorder shall be referred to
the City Attorney and Department of Public Works for investigation and
recommendation. The Department of Public Works' report shall be forwarded to
the City Attorney for evaluation, under the criteria of this chapter. All
payments shall first be authorized by the City Attorney or his/her designee and
all payments shall be made solely from funds appropriated and budgeted for
purposes of this chapter. (2001 Code § 90-6-202)

to make payment for loss under this chapter shall include the following
criteria:
      1.   Did an applicant suffer an otherwise uninsured property loss which

line, under circumstances where the applicant acted reasonably and responsibly
to avoid the loss and mitigate damage or loss;
      2.   Has the claimed property damage been substantiated in a commercially
reasonable manner; and
      3.   Payments under this chapter shall be limited to the depreciated

   B.   Disqualifying Events: Any one or more of the following conditions shall
result in the denial of all or part of an application for reimbursement or a
damage payment:

commercially reasonable standards.
   C.   City Offsets: Any one or more of the following conditions shall result

payment;
      2.   The loss exceeds the City funding limits or appropriated funds;

9-3-9: PAYMENT FOR CLEANUP AND SANITIZATION:
   A.   Property Owner May Choose To Have The City Do Initial Cleanup:
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, when a claimant notifies
the City of a breakage or backup of a City owned and maintained culinary water
line or sanitary sewer line, the City may offer to have its third party
contractor(s), retained for this purpose, initially clean up and, if necessary,
sanitize the damaged property, following the City's guidelines. Alternatively
the property owner may arrange separately for initial cleanup and sanitizing by
the property owner's own retained contractor(s). In this latter instance, the
City may reimburse to the property owner the actual costs of this cleanup and
sanitation, but only to the extent of what the work would have cost if the City
contractor had undertaken the cleanup and sanitizing.
   B.   Initial Cleanup And Sanitizing Defined: Initial cleanup and sanitizing
may include stopping the flow of water or effluent, removing standing water or
sewer effluent from the property, and other precautions as outlined in the
City's guidelines. Initial cleanup and sanitizing does not include repairs to
or replacement of damaged building materials, personal property or any other
property damage claims. These latter damages may be eligible for reimbursement
through the process described in the other provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Cost Of Initial Cleanup Is In Addition To Damage Payments: The cost of
initial cleanup and sanitizing, whether provided by a City contractor or a
private contractor, shall be in addition to the reimbursement amount allowed by
subsection
9-3-8A of this chapter, but will be subject to the limitation in subsection
9-3-8B of this chapter and the appropriation of funds each year by the City
Council for this purpose.
   D.   Scope Of Initial Cleanup And Sanitizing At City Discretion; No Special
Or Consequential Damages: The extent, method and costs of initial cleanup and
sanitizing by a City provided contractor will be at the sole and independent
discretion of the City. In no event shall the City pay, or reimburse the
property owner for the payment of, special or consequential damages. (2001 Code
§ 90-6-303; amd. Ord. 09-16, 6-9-2009)
9-3-10: PAYMENT DOES NOT IMPLY LIABILITY OR WAIVE GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY:
   A.   No City Admission Of Responsibility: The adoption of this chapter and
any payment made pursuant to this chapter is not an admission of liability and
it does not imply any negligence or responsibility on the part of the City,
including responsibility for any damage or loss.
   B.   No Waiver Of Immunity: This chapter shall not in any way supersede,
change, modify or abrogate the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah, including
Utah Code Annotated section 63G-7-101 et seq., or any successor provisions.
Further, this chapter does not create a cause of action or establish a right to
sue the City.
   C.   Payment Is Release Of Liability Claim: Acceptance of any payment made
pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a full and complete release of any
and all claims against the City, its officers, employees and agents arising

CHAPTER 4
SANITARY SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
SECTION:
9-4-1: Mandatory Connection
9-4-2: Sanitary Sewer System For Subdivisions
9-4-3: Regulating Effluent Into City Sewer System
9-4-4: Later Adopted More Restrictive Standards
9-4-5: Violations And Penalties
9-4-1: MANDATORY CONNECTION:
   A.   Requirements: It is unlawful for the owner or other person having
charge of or occupying any property upon which a building shall have been or is
being constructed for residential, commercial or industrial use, any part of
which property is within three hundred feet (300') of any public way in which a
public sewer line is then in existence and used, to construct or permit to be
constructed, or to use or permit to be used, any privy vault, septic tank or
cesspool upon such property. Each such owner or other person shall, within
sixty (60) days after having been given notice by the Chief Administrative
Officer that an accepted public sewer is ready to receive connections, cause
such building to be connected with the sewer (except that if such building
shall not at the time such notice is given have any toilets, the owner or other
person having charge of or occupying such building shall have a period of 2
years in which to connect it with such public sewer). It shall thereafter be
unlawful for such owner or other person to have the plumbing in such building
remain unconnected to the public sewer or to maintain or use or cause or permit
to exist any privy vault, septic tank or cesspool to which the building is
connected or which is used by the occupants. Whenever an accepted public sewer
is available to receive connections, the Chief Administrative Officer shall
cause appropriate notice to be served upon the owner, agent or other person
having charge of or occupying any property coming within the scope of this
subsection, that the public sewer is ready to receive connections and that all
plumbing must be connected with such sewer.
   B.   Prohibited Methods Of Disposal: Where sewer service is available as
provided in subsection A of this section, and except as expressly provided in
subsection A of this section, all methods of sewage disposal other than through
connection with the City sewer system are prohibited and are declared to be a
nuisance and health hazard.
   C.   Sanitary Sewer Master Plan: The sanitary sewer system shall be in
accordance with the City sanitary sewer master plan. All developments and
construction within the City shall incorporate applicable recommendations of
the adopted City sanitary sewer master plan, and shall comply with construction
standards established in the City public improvement standards, specifications
and plans manual.
   D.   Licensed Plumber Required: All connections must be done by a plumber
licensed by the State. All connections to the City sewer line shall be
inspected by a City inspector prior to the backfilling of the trench.
   E.   Maintenance Responsibility: The property owner, not the City, shall be
responsible for the construction, maintenance, and repair of the lateral
connecting the property to the City main utility line, including any portion of
the lateral within the public right-of-way. Such owner responsibility covers
all problems and defects in that lateral, including, but not limited to,
clogging, settling, breakage or defective parts including pumps necessitated by
below grade connections. The property owner shall obtain all necessary
excavation permits and pay all permit fees for repairs made within the public
right-of-way. (2001 Code § 90-2-102; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-24, 8-25-2010;
Ord. 19-05, 1-23-2019)
9-4-2: SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM FOR SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Standards; Laterals: For any "subdivision", as defined in titles 13 and
14 of this Code, the subdivider shall install a sewer system in compliance with
the provisions of the City public improvement standards, specifications and
plans manual. Each lot in the subdivision shall be provided with a lateral that
extends at least seventeen feet (17') inside the top back of the curb. The
subdivider shall mark on the sidewalk the location of all laterals.
   B.   Sewer Lines: For all "development", as defined in titles 13 and 14 of
this Code, all sewer lines shall be extended across the frontage of all
existing and proposed streets and to the boundary of the development. If the
city sanitary sewer master plan shows a sewer line larger than that required
for the proposed development, the developer, builder or property owner will
install the line of proper dimension.
   C.   Installation Of Off Site Equipment: The developer, builder or property
owner shall, at his expense, install all off site sanitary sewer lines, and all
other related equipment necessary to connect the development with existing city
systems.
   D.   Easements: If easements are required across abutting property for
sanitary sewer lines, the developer, builder or property owner shall obtain
such easements. (2001 Code § 87-5-111; amd. 2009 Code)
9-4-3: REGULATING EFFLUENT INTO CITY SEWER SYSTEM:
   A.   South Valley Water Reclamation Facility Regulations Adopted By
Reference:
      1.   The South Valley water reclamation facility (SVWRF) receives the
city's collective sewer effluent from all sources pursuant to an interlocal
agreement with the city. The city's collective stream of effluent is cleaned by
SVWRF to federal EPA standards and deposited into the Jordan River. In the
future this stream of cleaned sewer effluent may become a source of reusable
water for the city. When higher flows or more toxic flows are presented to
SVWRF, additional facilities and/or technological capabilities may be required,
at a significant cost to the city. As a result it is in the city's public
interest to work closely with SVWRF for the benefit of the citizens of the city
as a whole.
      2.   SVWRF has issued, and may in the future issue or amend, rules and
regulations governing the deposit of certain categories of effluent into the
city sewer system for ultimate delivery to SVWRF. These rules and regulations,
as and when issued by SVWRF, are hereby incorporated into this title and
chapter by this reference, as if entirely set forth herein. A copy of the most
current SVWRF rules and regulation are available in the city clerk-recorder's
office and through the city's "public works" webpage (http://www.wjordan.com/
PW.aspx?pgID=3.14.6). The city council may, by resolution, affirmatively
decline to adopt one or more such rules and regulations, and such a resolution
shall be publicly available in the same places as, and together with, the rules
and regulations to which the resolution applies.
   B.   Unlawful Discharges: It is unlawful for any person to discharge any
substance into the city's sanitary sewer collection system of a type or in an
amount that does not comply with the limitations set forth: 1) in the SVWRF
rules and regulations, 2) in any permit issued by SVWRF, or 3) as provided
elsewhere in this chapter. (2001 Code § 90-2-105; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 11-18,
7-13-2011)
   C.   Sewer Fee Surcharge: A sewer fee surcharge, set forth in the city's
annually approved schedule of fees and charges, shall be assessed and collected
for any period of time during which a city sewer service customer is found to
be discharging prohibited types of substances or amounts of effluent into the
city's sanitary sewer collection system, and such a surcharge can be assessed
retroactively and on a daily basis. Sewer service fees shall not be deemed to
be paid in full unless and until all assessed surcharges, if any, for the
corresponding service period have been fully paid. Failure to pay a surcharge
can result in the shutoff of water service.
   D.   Tampering Unlawful: It is unlawful for any person to tamper with or
attempt to defeat the operation of an official sampling or metering device
installed to make measurements to ensure compliance with this chapter.
   E.   Special High Pollutant Effluent Requirements:
      1.   The SVWRF permitting process will result in each high pollutant
discharger in the city obtaining a permit stating the acceptable types and
effluent levels of EPA regulated pollutants discharged to the sanitary sewer
collection system. At the time of this permit being issued, the city will
determine for the particular pollutant discharger a base, average and maximum
daily effluent level for each type of pollutant. The city shall assess and
charge a sewer fee surcharge for each day that a regulated pollutant exceeds
the permitted base effluent level. Effluent discharge at or above the average
effluent level for each pollutant will be assessed a higher sewer surcharge
fee, and shall require that the pollutant discharger pretreat its effluent on
site to reduce the pollutant level discharge to the permitted base discharge
level. Surcharge amounts will accrue daily pending completion of construction
and implementation of on site pretreatment facilities.
      2.   If a pollutant discharger fails to limit and maintain its effluent
at or below average levels of effluent into the city sanitary sewer system,
fails to timely install pretreatment facilities when directed by the city or
SVWRF, discharges effluent into the city sanitary sewer at or above maximum
levels, or defiantly refuses compliance with SVWRF rules and regulations, the
director of public works is hereby authorized and directed to issue an order
closing the business and otherwise causing any further release into the city
sanitary sewer system to cease. A copy of such an order will be provided to the
city police department and to the pollutant discharger. Such an order is
immediately appealable to district court.
   F.   Capacity Allocation: As an owner of SVWRF, the city has been allocated
a limited portion of the polluted water treatment capacity of SVWRF within
which the city must accommodate all of its sewer service customers. If the city
needs additional capacity at SVWRF, it will either have to purchase such
capacity from another owner or finance an expansion of SVWRF, if possible.
Therefore, any person seeking to enter and do business in the city, or any
person seeking to commence or expand a business within the city, and which
business can reasonably be known to discharge polluted effluent into the city
sewer system, must affirmatively approach the city through the director of
public works to obtain an allocation of the city's remaining capacity at SVWRF.
Depending on the availability of such capacity, the director of public works
may approve and grant the requested capacity allocation, may decline to allow
the business to open without full and complete removal of all pollutants from
the expected sewer effluent on site, or may allocate some but not all of the
requested allocation, requiring the on site treatment and removal of
pollutants. No city business license may be granted nor city planning or zoning
approvals made finally effective without an appropriate order of the director
of public works under this chapter. (2001 Code § 90-2-106; amd. 2009 Code; Ord.
11-18, 7-13-2011)
9-4-4: LATER ADOPTED MORE RESTRICTIVE STANDARDS:
   A.   Upon promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment standard for
a particular industrial subcategory developed pursuant to 40 CFR 403.6, the
national standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed in this chapter
for sources in that subcategory, such standard shall immediately supersede the
limitations imposed in this chapter. The SVWRF general manager shall notify all
affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
   B.   If the governments of the United States Of America (through the
environmental protection agency or some other regulatory agency), the state
(through the state board of health or some other regulatory agency), and/or the
county (through the Salt Lake Valley health department or some other regulatory
agency) shall adopt standards which are more restrictive than the standards
listed in this chapter and which are applicable to users of the city's sanitary
sewer system, such standards shall be deemed to be adopted pursuant to this
chapter and shall be controlling upon all users of the city's sanitary sewer
system. (2001 Code § 90-2-110; Ord. 09-21, 7-14-2009; Ord. 11-18, 7-13-2011)
9-4-5: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Termination Of Service: The city may terminate utility service to any
residential, commercial or industrial customer for repeated or continuing
violation of this chapter. Such termination shall not prevent the city from
pursuing any and all remedies available under local, state and federal laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations, including civil injunction, civil damages,
criminal penalties, fines, and any other remedies available in law or in
equity.
   B.   Strict Liability: Any person violating any provision of this chapter
shall be responsible for all damages resulting from such violation without
regard to fault, knowledge, intent or state of mind of the person committing
the violation, including, but not limited to, damages to the city's sewer
system and damage to the SVWRF facilities or processes. The prosecution of a
criminal offense involving the violation of this chapter, and the conviction
for such violation shall not require proof of any culpable mental state on the
part of any person. For this purpose, the city council, in accordance with Utah
code section 76-2-102, intends to impose criminal responsibility for the
commission or omission of conduct prohibited by this chapter. (2001 Code § 90-
2-111; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 11-18, 7-13-2011)

owner may construct such pipeline facilities on and under private property as
the property owner finds to be appropriate and required in order to connect
said property owner's property with the City's water distribution system,
subject to such permits and inspections otherwise provided in this Code. Such
pipeline facilities will be and remain the private property of the constructing
property owner and the maintenance and repair of such pipeline facilities shall
be the responsibility of said property owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it
shall be unlawful for such a property owner to permit another property owner to
construct and connect a pipeline with the first property owner's pipeline
facilities for the purpose of indirectly obtaining City water. If such a
connection is permitted by the first property owner, then and in that event the
pipeline facilities constructed by the first property owner to connect with the
City's water distribution system shall forthwith be tendered to the City
without cost or reimbursement as a dedicated City water line, to be owned and
maintained by the City thenceforth and forever, provided the City desires to
take ownership of the system and an easement for the system is granted in favor
of the City. If the City accepts the water line as City property, it will do so
by means of a bill of sale and the submission to the City of "as built"
engineering drawings depicting the location and other material information
about the pipeline.
   G.   City Ownership Of Delivered Culinary Water:
      1.   Lawful connection to the City's culinary water system through a
utility service agreement with the City does not convey a water right or any
other ownership in the delivered water, but provides a utility service only; in
this case potable water on demand at one or more taps or hose bibbs on the
property. Any and all culinary water delivered by the City and not internally
consumed by humans or animals on site, or lost through evaporation or reentry
into the groundwater on site, shall be returned to the City through the City's
sanitary sewer system as may be in place from time to time.
      2.   It is unlawful for a culinary water customer to process, bottle and
sell, or otherwise dispose of City water other than as provided in this section
except as may be allowed in a written agreement with the City expressly
referencing this section, and providing for just compensation to the City for
any loss of its water.
      3.   In the event that culinary water is received from the City and, used
on site in the processing of food or other manufacturing processes, resulting
in contaminated water unsuitable for culinary purposes, any delivery and sale
of such used and contaminated water is unlawful except by means of a written
agreement with the City expressly referencing this section, and providing for
just compensation to the City for any loss of its water. (2001 Code § 90-4-201;

subdivider shall pay for the residential water meter, which will then be
installed by the Utility Billing Division of the Finance Department.
   B.   Water Lines: For all "development", as defined in titles 13 and 14 of
this Code, all water lines shall be extended across the entire frontage of all
existing and proposed streets and to the boundary of the development. If the
City master plan shows a water line larger than that required for the proposed
development, the developer, builder or property owner will install the line of
proper dimension.
   C.   Installation Of Off Site Equipment: The developer, builder or property
owner shall, at his/her expense, install all off site culinary water lines, and
all other related equipment necessary to connect the development with existing
City systems. Off site lines shall be a minimum of eight inches (8") in
diameter and shall be dedicated to the City. Wherever possible, the developer,
builder or property owner shall install water lines into the development from
two (2) different directions in order to provide a looped water system.
   D.   Easements: If easements are required across any property for culinary
water lines, the developer, builder or property owner shall obtain such
easements. (2001 Code § 87-5-111; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 11-17, 7-13-2011; Ord.

depreciated value of the property.
APPLICANT: The owner of residential property that was impacted by a flooding
event.

property upon which a structure sits that, to a reasonable degree of
engineering certainty, will reduce the likelihood of flooding from a flooding
event in the residential structure or likely reduce the severity of flooding
from a flooding event.
CLEAN-UP COSTS: The expenses reasonably and actually incurred by an applicant
after a flooding event to remove standing stormwater, debris, and damaged
property from the residence and property, sanitize flooded areas of the
residence, or demolish any property such as flooring or drywall that needs to
be removed from the residence due to water damage. The costs to repair or
replace damaged building material, personal property, or other property damaged
in a flooding event are not clean-up costs, but rather property damage possibly
covered as substantiated property damage.
FLOODING EVENT: An event where: a) stormwater backflows out of intake points
for the stormwater system and b) the backflowed water enters a structure
causing damage.
REPLACEMENT COST VALUE: The cost to replace damaged property with new property

fixtures, and personal property caused directly and principally by a flooding
event, including the cost to rebuild or restore damaged portions of the
residence, the actual cash value of personal property and fixtures destroyed,
or the cost to repair personal property and fixtures that were not completely
destroyed. (Ord. 18-09, 4-24-2018)
9-8-3: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to adopt a program that allows for payment or
reimbursement of clean-up costs and substantiated property damage resulting

chapter is not an admission of liability and it does not imply any negligence
or responsibility on the part of the City, including responsibility for any
damage or loss.

the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah, including Utah Code Annotated section
63G-7-101 et seq., or any successor provisions. This chapter is a grant program
voluntarily enacted by the City. As such, there is no vested right to funds
under this chapter and it does not create a cause of action or establish a
right to sue the City if funds are unavailable or not awarded. (Ord. 18-09, 4-
24-2018)
9-8-13: APPEAL RIGHTS:
   A.   The City shall render a decision in writing on each application. The

application(s) under this chapter, such an applicant may appeal the City's
initial decision to an Appeal Board consisting of the Director of Human
Resources and Risk Management, the Chief Administrative Officer and the Council
Chair. The Chief Executive Officer may authorize an Assistant Chief
Administrative Officer or a department or division director to substitute for
either the Director of Human Resources and Risk Management or the Chief
Administrative Officer. The Council Chair may authorize another Council member
to substitute for him/her.
   C.   The appeal may be commenced by filing a statement of reasons with the
City Clerk. The statement of reasons may be delivered personally or by
certified mail within ten (10) business days following the date of the City's
initial decision. The statement of reasons must be clear and sufficient to
apprise the members of the Appeal Board who are unfamiliar with the application
of the basis of the appeal.
   D.   Once an appeal is filed with the City Clerk, the Appeal Board will meet
within ten (10) business days to hear and decide the appeal. The applicant will
be informed of the date and time set for the Appeal Board meeting and the
applicant may attend and respond to questions from the Appeal Board.
      1.   The Appeal Board shall render a decision in writing on the appeal
within thirty (30) calendar days of their convening. The decision shall bear a
date of issuance and be promptly delivered to the appellant by certified mail,
email, or any means authorized for service of process under the Utah Rules of
Civil Procedure.
   E.   If the appellant is aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board, the
appellant may appeal the decision of the Appeal Board to the City Council by
filing a statement of reasons with the City Clerk. The statement of reasons may
be delivered personally or by certified mail within ten (10) business days
following the denial of the appeal by the Appeal Board. The statement of
reasons must be clear and sufficient to apprise the City Council of the basis
of the appeal. The appeal will be placed on the first available agenda for a
regularly scheduled City Council meeting to be considered.
   F.   Because this chapter is a grant program under which applicants have no
vested right to receive funds, there is no right to appeal the City Council's
decision to District Court. (Ord. 18-09, 4-24-2018; amd. Ord. 19-05, 1-23-2019)

the appropriateness, safety and stability of the proposed cut or fill slope.
Such documentation and report shall be prepared at the applicant's expense and
shall address the need for and design of necessary measures to provide for the
safety and stability of the proposed cut or fill slope.
   C.   Unstable Material: The city engineer may require any cut or fill to be
constructed with an exposed surface flatter than two horizontal to one vertical
(2:1) when, in the city engineer's opinion, under the particular conditions,
such flatter surface is deemed necessary for stability or safety.
   D.   Fill Slope Limits: Toes of fill slopes shall not be made nearer to a
property boundary line than one-half (1/2) of the height of the fill, or twenty
feet (20'), whichever is less. Fill slopes shall not be divided horizontally by
property lines. Fill slopes occurring on a side or rear lot line shall be made
a part of the downhill lot.
   E.   Intervening Terraces: When intervening terraces are used, terraces
shall be paved using materials as approved by the city and shall have a minimum
width of six feet (6'). Terraces shall be extensively landscaped in accordance
with an approved landscaping plan. Terraces shall be spaced at vertical
intervals of twenty five feet (25'); provided, however, for slopes less than
forty feet (40') in vertical height, terraces shall be approximately at mid
height. For slopes flatter than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1), or where
soil conditions require, additional intervening terraces may be required.
   F.   Compaction: All fills shall be placed, compacted, inspected and tested
in accordance with the provisions of this title and the land disturbance design
and construction standards. If the strict enforcement of the compaction
provisions of this subsection is determined by the city engineer to be
unnecessary because of the proposed or probable use of the land, the city
engineer may waive the requirements. The requirements of this subsection shall
not be waived when structures are to be supported by the fill, the fills are
being placed in areas to be designated as hillside, or where the fills are
necessary as a safety measure to aid in preventing the saturation, settling,
slipping or erosion of the fill.
   G.   Fills Toeing Out On Natural Slopes: Except as otherwise provided
herein, no fills toeing out on natural slopes, which are steeper than two
horizontal to one vertical (2:1) shall be permitted. The city engineer may
approve such fills toeing out on natural slopes which are steeper than two
horizontal to one vertical (2:1) as deemed appropriate in his or her sole
discretion based upon the circumstances and conditions of the proposed site and
fill. Any fill slope proposed to toe out on natural slopes which are steeper
than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) shall be supported by documentation
and a report prepared and signed by a professional engineering geologist and
soils engineer attesting to the appropriateness, safety and stability of the
proposed fill. Such documentation and report shall be prepared at the
applicant's expense and shall address the need for and design of necessary
measures to provide for the safety and stability of the proposed fill.
   H.   Combined Cut And Fill Slopes: Combined cut and fill slopes shall meet
the requirements of this section insofar as steepness, height and terracing are
concerned, except that, where the slope exceeds twenty five feet (25') in
height, the required drainage bench shall be placed at the top of the cut
slope.
   I.   Setback: Fill placed on or above the top of an existing or proposed cut
or natural slope steeper than three horizontal to one vertical (3:1) shall be
set back from the top of the slope a minimum distance as required by the
international building code, as adopted by the city, or such greater distance
as approved by the city engineer based upon submitted reports and documentation
for the project.

recommendations and design criteria for corrective measures shall be included
within the soils engineering report.
   K.   Measure Of Settlement: The city engineer or the building official may
require the determination of the settlement characteristics of any fills to
establish that any movements have substantially ceased. In such cases, a system
of bench marks shall be installed by a civil engineer or land surveyor at
critical points on the fill, and accurate measurements of both horizontal and
vertical movements shall be taken and evaluated by the soils engineer for a
period of time sufficient to define the settlement behavior. The evaluation
period shall be monitored in accordance with the approved geotechnical report
for the project.
   L.   Buttress Fills: All buttress fills shall be designed in accordance with
the land disturbance design and construction standards and the recommendations
and design criteria, including the subdrain system, submitted by the soils
engineer or engineering geologist with the approval of the city engineer. (2001
Code § 81-3-060)

DISTRICT:
The permit holder shall indicate on the site plan or subdivision plat required
for the site or project, the maximum building envelope, or area of ultimate
land/vegetation disturbance, including designation of the building envelope's
distance from the lot or site boundary lines, which will be caused by the
proposed structure and its appurtenances. Prior to the beginning of any type of
land disturbance or construction on a given lot, the contractor performing the
work is responsible for identifying the building envelope in the field by
marking of the building envelope perimeter. The building official may require
markers to be surveyed when deemed necessary or appropriate. No land
disturbance activity shall commence on the lot prior to inspection by the city
building and safety division of the building envelope marking. (2001 Code § 81-
3-100)
11-3-11: PROPERTY LINE AND CORNER MARKERS:

constructed as part of the project. Slope protection easements shall be
provided either through indicating them on the final plat or by separate
recordable easement acceptable to the city. (2001 Code § 81-3-112)
11-3-13: LOTS GRADED TOWARD STREET FOR DRAINAGE:
Except as otherwise provided herein, stormwater runoff from individual lots
shall be directed toward the streets. Exceptions may be granted by the city
engineer, when deemed appropriate and necessary, in accordance with the
provisions of this section. Aesthetic reasons, such as the creation of view
lots, shall not constitute sufficient reason for granting an exception. If the
permit holder finds that draining stormwater toward the street is unobtainable,
for a portion or all of the lot, the permit holder shall demonstrate to the
city engineer that there are no other avenues for drainage of the stormwater.
In such cases, the permit holder shall prepare a drainage plan which indicates
how the stormwater will be disposed of from the lot, to either a city owned
storm drain, a natural stream or channel, a manmade channel, other city
approved facility or retained on site. The permit holder is responsible for
obtaining the necessary approvals and permits for the discharge or retention of
stormwater flows. The city engineer will determine if such alternate drainage
is both necessary and appropriate. (2001 Code § 81-3-130)
11-3-14: LOTS WHICH CANNOT BE GRADED TOWARD STREET:
   A.   Approval Required: Lots that cannot be drained toward the street may be
allowed to drain a portion of their stormwater runoff toward the rear of the
yard, after review and approval by the city engineer. Prior to obtaining this
approval, the permit holder shall prepare a drainage plan, which indicates how
the stormwater will be disposed of from the lot, to either a city owned storm
drain, a natural stream or channel, or manmade channel, or other city approved
facility or retained on site. Such disposal is to be protected by a drainage
easement dedicated for this purpose, and the facilities shall be subject to the
bonding provisions set forth in chapter 4 of this title.
   B.   Swales: Swales located in rear and side yards shall be of materials as
approved by the city that will prevent erosion, and shall be a permanent
feature of the lot and shall be shown in a drainage easement on the site plan
or final plat for the project. An actual design drawing of the swale system
shall be prepared and be included as part of the grading and drainage plan for
the project. If slopes exist between lots, sufficient space shall be allowed to
include a swale at the top of the slope and one at the bottom, all within
dedicated storm drainage easements. Where stormwater is transferred from a lot
of higher elevation to a lower lot in elevation, sufficient energy dissipation
shall be constructed to reduce the water velocity to an acceptable level.
Engineering calculations are to be submitted to the engineering department
certifying the proposed design of the energy dissipation facilities as set
forth in the LDDCS.
   C.   Notice: Swales shall be constructed and in place before building
permits are issued on subdivision lots. The developer shall notify the
homebuilders and homeowners shall be notified of these drainage swale easements
and the need to maintain them both during and after construction. Homeowners
are to be notified by the developer of the installation of these side and rear
yard swales through an acceptable instrument to the city. A notice of these
drainage swale easements shall also be recorded on the subdivision plat for the
project. After completion of the swales, the homeowners shall be responsible
for maintenance of swales.
   D.   Bonding: In the event these types of swales are used for the project,
the developer shall provide sufficient bonding of these swales as part of the
city's regular public improvement bonding, to ensure these facilities will be
constructed.
   E.   Underground Facilities: The developer may select the option of
designing and constructing underground drainage facilities to replace
aboveground drainage swales if these facilities meet certain city requirements.
These requirements include the design being approved by the engineering
department, inclusion of these facilities within city approved drainage
easements, maintenance of the system by a homeowners' association, and other
requirements as may be deemed necessary by the city. (2001 Code § 81-3-140)
11-3-15: MATERIALS FOR SIDE AND REAR YARD DRAINAGE:
Side and rear yard swales and drainage facilities shall be designed into
projects as an integral component of the stormwater system of the project which
needs to transfer stormwater runoff from the rear and side yards to the street,
or to other rear yard stormwater facilities. These swales or drain facilities
shall be designed and constructed in such a way that they become a permanent
feature of the side and/or rear yard and shall be constructed of a material as
approved by the city which prevents erosion. Inspections of these swales or
drain facilities shall be conducted during the subdivision construction phase
of the project and during lot level development. Developers are to provide
recorded drainage easements wide enough to provide for the possible slight
field relocation of rear and side yard drainage swales, or other drainage
facilities. At a minimum, the drainage easement shall be for the width of the
swale plus two feet (2'). (2001 Code § 81-3-150)
11-3-16: FLOW OF WATER FROM ONE LOT TO ANOTHER; LIMITED USE:
In the case where stormwater flow is allowed to flow from a higher lot to a
lower lot, in elevation, sufficient energy dissipation shall be designed and
constructed to reduce the water velocity to an acceptable level to prevent
erosion. The design and construction of these energy dissipation structures
shall be approved by the engineering department in conjunction with the review
and approval of the drainage plan for the project. (2001 Code § 81-3-160)
11-3-17: LANDSCAPING OF CERTAIN LOTS FOR EROSION CONTROL:
The city reserves the right to require that the lots be revegetated or
stabilized prior to issuance of building permits or that lots be fully
landscaped prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as part of the
requirements of the project. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that,
for certain areas in the city which have soils susceptible to severe erosion,
that erosion is controlled. The criteria to be used by the city are the size of
the lot and sizes of adjacent lots, elevation differences between lots, and the
type of soils in the project, along with other factors. A landscaping plan
shall be submitted to the engineering department for approval prior to
commencement of landscaping improvements required hereunder. (2001 Code § 81-3-
170)
11-3-18: EROSION CONTROL AND REVEGETATION:
The developer is to indicate erosion control and revegetation BMPs to be used
for the project on the project drawings and as part of the project descriptions
included with the application in accordance with the city LDDCS. Erosion and
sedimentation control measures will be inspected upon completion, during
construction of the subdivision, and once the subdivision construction is
complete. The engineering department will be responsible for these inspections.
Once the subdivision level construction is complete and improvement work begins
on individual lots, erosion and sedimentation control BMPs will be inspected
prior to any disturbance, during construction and once lot level construction
is complete. The building division will be responsible for these inspections.
(2001 Code § 81-3-180)
11-3-19: WET WEATHER PLAN:
The city engineer may require that land disturbance activities and erosion
control or revegetation plans be modified, if unforeseen delays occur due to
weather generated problems not considered at the time the land disturbance
permit was issued, including submission and approval of a wet weather plan.
(2001 Code § 81-3-190)
11-3-20: LAND DISTURBANCE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:

immediately stop the work being performed if, in the opinion of the City

($1,000,000.00), name the city as an additional insured, and indemnify and hold
harmless the city from any and all injuries and defense costs arising from the
placement or use of the bus bench or bus shelter sign.
      4.   Sign Permit Required: A sign permit shall be required for each bus
bench sign and bus shelter sign, and all applications for a sign permit must
include the following:
         a.   Written approval from the property owner of the proposed location
for the bus bench/shelter sign is required and shall be submitted with the sign

not require the issuance of a new permit or the payment of an additional fee,
if the bench/shelter is placed in the same location as originally permitted;
         d.   A signed contract with the city for each bus bench or bus shelter
sign located on public property; and
         e.   Include a site plan, vicinity map and specifications for bus
bench and shelters, as well as any improvements needed for the particular site.
      5.   Approval: Once an applicant has obtained approval for the location

permit is maintained or until the property owner withdraws the approval in
writing.
   D.   Billboard Signs:
      1.   Compliance With Law: Unless expressly provided otherwise, the
erection, construction, reconstruction, location, relocation, placement,
replacement, restoration, extension, enlargement, alteration, modification,
upgrade, repair and maintenance of a billboard must comply with this title,
title 13 of this code, and applicable state law.
      2.   Location: Billboard signs shall only be located on lots or parcels
adjacent to streets that are adjacent to arterial streets as identified on the
future roadway network map in the West Jordan master transportation plan,
including Airport Road, Old Bingham Highway, New Bingham Highway and Bangerter
Highway. Billboards shall not be allowed along the Mountain View Corridor.
      3.   Density: A billboard shall be considered a sign for the purpose of
density on lots or parcels of land that qualify for a sign, except that if the
billboard was located on the lot pursuant to a bona fide lease agreement with a
third party prior to the installation of the pole sign, the billboard may
remain upon the lot as a nonconforming billboard.
      4.   Residential, Mixed Use (Residential, Commercial, Office), Or Mixed
Use Overlay Zone Prohibition: A billboard shall not be located within a
residential zone or within a two hundred fifty foot (250') radius from a
residential zone, except billboard signs along Bangerter Highway which shall

zone. A billboard sign (digital display) shall not be located closer than three
hundred feet (300') from any residential zoning district boundary and shall not
be located closer than five hundred feet (500') from any residential zoning
district boundary if the billboard faces a residential area as determined
through the conditional use permit review process. A billboard sign shall not
be located within any mixed use or mixed use overlay zone, regardless of the
underlying zoning classification. The minimum separation between billboard
signs (digital display) and any other billboard sign shall be one thousand two
hundred fifty feet (1,250'). The separation distance may be reduced where the
planning commission finds that there are extenuating circumstances that justify
a reduction in the separation requirement such as reducing the negative effects
of ambient lighting or visual impacts on adjoining uses or mitigating safety
concerns. In no case shall the minimum separation between billboards be less
than seven hundred fifty feet (750').
      5.   Numerical Limit: The sum total of all conforming and nonconforming
billboards in the city shall not exceed fourteen (14). Up to seven (7) of the
fourteen (14) total billboards shall be located to the east of Bangerter
Highway and up to seven (7) shall be located to the west of Bangerter Highway.

         a.   The standards and requirements for revoking a conditional use
permit set forth in section
13-7E-10 of this code shall not apply to this section. Whether conforming or
nonconforming, a billboard and associated rights shall be terminated only
pursuant to the provisions of this section and applicable state law.

      13.   Billboard Signs (Digital Display): In addition to subsections D1 to
D12 of this section, all billboard signs (digital display) shall meet the
following standards unless contrary to the provisions of applicable state or
federal law:
         a.   New billboard signs (digital display) are limited to a "double
sided" configuration (i.e., 1 sign face or display area mounted on opposite
sides of the same support structure so that both sign faces are at the same
elevation and are effectively not visible at the same time from any vantage
point as reasonably determined by the city).
         b.   A billboard sign that is converted to a billboard sign (digital
display) shall not be larger or taller in height, width or display area than
the sign from which it was converted. The planning commission may increase the
height of the sign to the maximum allowed under section
12-3-2 of this chapter where the planning commission finds that safety is a
concern. A single faced sign may not be converted to a double faced sign.
         c.   Each electronic display area capable of showing a separate
electronic message shall be considered to be a separate billboard with an
electronic digital display including those sharing the same support structure.
         d.   The text, images and graphics on a billboard sign (digital
display) shall be static and complete within themselves, without continuation
in content to the next image or message or to any other sign. Serial messages
that require multiple passes or multiple signs to comprehend the message are
prohibited.
         e.   All text and images must be of a size and shape to not cause
drivers to reduce speed or become unreasonably distracted in order to
comprehend the message. The city's focus under this subsection shall be the
method (in terms of letter size and other quantifiable physical attributes)
used to convey a message on a billboard sign (digital display) rather than the
content of such message.
         f.   A billboard sign (digital display) shall not include animation,
full motion video, flashing, scrolling, strobing, racing, blinking, changes in
color, fade in or fade out or any other imitation of movement or motion, or any
other means not providing constant illumination.
         g.   The transition from one static display to another must be
effectively instantaneous, with a twirl time not exceeding 0.25 second.
         h.   Every billboard sign (digital display) shall be equipped with a
mechanism that automatically controls the sign's display period at all times as
provided in this section. The dwell time for each message on a billboard sign
(digital display) shall be at least eight (8) seconds, such that each message
shall be illuminated and static for at least eight (8) seconds before
transitioning to a new static display.
         i.   A billboard sign (digital display) shall comply with the
following illuminance requirements:
            (1)   No billboard sign (digital display) shall cause illuminance
in excess of three-tenths (0.3) foot-candle above ambient light as measured
perpendicular to the billboard at a distance in feet calculated as follows:
               (A)   The square root of the product of 100 multiplied by the
sign face area (a) (in square feet).

IMAGES/0-0-0-3449.gif]
For example, if the billboard sign's (digital display's) electronic sign face
measures ten feet by thirty feet (10' x 30') (300 square feet), then the
illuminance caused by such use could not exceed three-tenths (0.3) foot-candle
above ambient light at a perpendicular distance of 173 feet from the billboard
sign (digital display) sign face.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3451.gif]
         j.   Every billboard sign (digital display) shall be equipped with an
automatic dimmer control or other mechanism that automatically controls the
sign's illuminance as provided above in direct correlation with natural ambient
light conditions at all times.
         k.   A billboard sign (digital display) may not be illuminated, lit or
operated between ten o'clock (10:00) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. if it
is oriented toward and located within three hundred feet (300') of any property
zoned or occupied for a residential use unless the message is an emergency
public safety warning or alert, such as an "Amber Alert".
         l.   The following certifications are additional conditions of
approval or continuation of any billboard sign (digital display):
            (1)   Within ten (10) calendar days after a billboard sign (digital
display) is first placed into service, a written certification shall be
submitted to the city from the owner/applicant that the sign has been tested
and complies with the motion, dwell time, twirl time, illuminance and other
requirements of this section.
            (2)   Based on complaints received, or for other reasonable cause,
the city may from time to time require the owner or operator of a billboard
sign (digital display) to provide, within ten (10) calendar days after receipt
of the city's written request, an updated written certification that the sign
has been retested and has been repaired or modified, as necessary, to comply
with the requirements of this section.
            (3)   The city also may, at its option, from time to time verify a
billboard sign's (digital display's) compliance with the requirements of this
section, including by selecting and engaging qualified experts to measure the
sign's illuminance and indirect illuminance. If the city reasonably determines
that a billboard sign (digital display) is not in compliance with such
requirements, then the owner or operator of the sign shall correct the
noncompliance within ten (10) calendar days after written notice from the city,
and shall reimburse all of the city's costs reasonably incurred in connection
with such determination.
         m.   Any billboard sign (digital display) not conforming to the
requirements of this section is prohibited.
   E.   Directional Signs:
      1.   Off premises private directional signs are permissible only in cases
where, due to its unusual location, a business is not easily seen from or is
not located near a street.
      2.   Private directional signs shall contain only the name or logo of an
establishment or directions such as "parking", "drive-through" or "exit".
   F.   Freeway Oriented Signs: Freeway oriented signs shall only be approved
in conjunction with an overall sign plan for a regional shopping center.
   G.   Historic Monuments And Markers: Historic monuments and markers shall be

that displays only those businesses and facilities located within the campus or
business center.

certificate of occupancy and zoning compliance (hereinafter referred to as
"certificate") for the property development, premises and/or building by the
city. It is unlawful to occupy, or to allow the occupancy or use of, any
property development, premises or building that has a materially different
design or greater intensity of use or different occupancy than specifically
provided for in the approved certificate.
   B.   Certificate Of Occupancy And Zoning Compliance: A certificate of
occupancy and zoning compliance shall be issued by the city administrator or a
designee after a real property development and/or building is completed and has
passed final inspection. A temporary certificate not to exceed a period of six
(6) months may be issued if the city administrator or his designee makes a
written determination that conditions of zoning, site plan or other required
approvals have been substantially met, but that acceptable circumstances have
prevented or necessitated a delay in the installation of certain improvements
required by the approved site plan, and that such delay will not create a
hazard or safety concern. During the months of October to April, a cash bond
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of estimated completion costs shall be
required prior to issuance of the temporary certificate. During the months of
May to September, a cash bond equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the

   C.   Inspection And Release Of Bond: When a cash bond has been posted with
the city, an inspection must be scheduled with city staff to determine that all
conditions of zoning, site plan, or other required approvals have been met.
Once the city administrator or his designee has determined that all conditions
to the approval of the project have been met, the cash bond may be released and
permanent occupancy and/or use granted. If conditions have not been met at the
end of the six (6) month period, permanent occupancy will not be granted and
the cash bond will be retained by the city. The retained funds shall be
expended for the purpose of completing the required work which may be completed
by city staff, contractor hired by the city, or others at the city's discretion
and with city approval. Funds not expended for completion of the work shall be
returned to the party who posted the bond.
   D.   Failure To Obtain Certificate Of Occupancy And Zoning Compliance:
Occupation without obtaining a certificate of occupancy and zoning compliance
or allowing to be occupied or used any residential, commercial, industrial or
institutional property development and/or building, or premises, or for
changing the use or occupancy classification as provided for in the certificate
issued under this title, shall be a violation of this title, subject to
prosecution as provided in this code.
   E.   Nuisance: The occupancy or use of any real property development and/or
building for which a certificate has not been issued is hereby declared to be a
nuisance and may be abated as such. It shall also be a nuisance for any real
property development and/or building to be used or occupied with greater
intensity or different use or design than authorized in its permits and
certificates. (2001 Code § 89-1-109; amd. Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective at

authority authorizes only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in
the approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Use, arrangements or construction at variance with that shown on
approved plans and specifications may be deemed a violation of this title.
(2001 Code § 89-1-110)
13-1-11: CONFLICTING PROVISIONS:
   A.   CC&Rs, HOA Agreements And Similar Covenants Or Agreements: This title
shall not nullify the more restrictive provisions of covenants and agreements
like covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs), homeowners' association
agreements and similar covenants and agreements.
   B.   Substantive Ordinances: This title contains substantive ordinances
governing its subject matter and scope. In the event of a conflict between the
substantive terms of this title or between this title and the substantive terms
of any other title, law, ordinance or rule, the more restrictive provision
shall apply. (2001 Code § 89-1-111; amd. 2009 Code)
13-1-12: PREVIOUS ORDINANCES CONSOLIDATED AND CONTINUED:
This title supersedes and amends title 89 of the 2001 West Jordan municipal
code. This title shall be deemed a continuation of said title 89 of the 2001
West Jordan municipal code and not a new enactment insofar as the substance of
revisions included herein, whether in the same or different language. This
title shall be so interpreted upon any question concerning the tenure of an
officer or board established by title 89 of the 2001 West Jordan municipal
code, or upon any question concerning conforming and nonconforming uses of
buildings and structures. (2001 Code § 89-1-112; amd. 2009 Code)
13-1-13: RELATIONSHIP TO CONTAMINATED SOILS PROVISIONS:
Title 5 of this code contains substantive environmental compliance requirements
applicable to all subjects otherwise regulated by this code. Specifically,
title 5, chapter 2 of this code applies to all land disturbance and land
development applications filed with the city. Persons considering filing
applications for land disturbance or land development should consult title 5,
chapter 2 of this code, in addition to the applicable provisions of this title
and titles 9, 10, 11, and 14 of this code. (2001 Code § 89-1-113)
13-1-14: RELATIONSHIP TO THIS TITLE AND TITLE 15:
   A.   Procedural Ordinances: Title 15 of this code is designed to contain
procedural ordinances governing the procedures involved in the application of
this title and other property development and use titles. The boundary between
what is substantive and what is procedural is imprecise. Persons using this
title should look for procedural requirements in this title and in title 15 of
this code. The procedures, if any, contained in this title and those contained
in title 15 of this code should be followed. If a procedural provision of this
title clearly and obviously conflicts with a provision in title 15 of this
code, the provision in title 15 of this code shall govern. (2009 Code)

13-5A-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Agricultural Zones is to provide areas where the growing of
crops and the raising of livestock can be encouraged and supported within the
City. Uses permitted in the A Zones, in addition to agricultural uses, must be
incidental thereto and should not change the basic agricultural character of
the zone. Conversion of the Agricultural Zone to zones allowing urban uses
should be accomplished in an orderly and progressive manner, with no "leap
frog" encroachments of such uses or developments into the agricultural area.
The A Zones should be established in agricultural areas needing protection from
encroachment of urban development until such time as residential, commercial or
industrial uses in such areas become necessary and desirable. (2001 Code § 89-
3-201)
13-5A-2: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
Uses allowed in Agricultural Zones are listed in the table below. Those uses
identified as "permitted" (P) are allowed by right; provided, that they comply
with all other requirements of this article and all other applicable
requirements of this title. Uses identified as "conditional" (C) must be
approved by the Planning Commission pursuant to the standards and procedures
for conditional uses set forth in chapter 7, article E of this title and title
15 of this Code, and comply with all other applicable requirements of this
title. Uses identified as "administrative conditional uses" (AC) shall be
approved by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in
chapter 7, article E of this title, except that the public hearing shall be
conducted by the Zoning Administrator, and shall comply with title 15 of this
Code, and all other applicable requirements of this title. Uses not
specifically listed in this section shall not be allowed in Agricultural Zones.

SECTION:
13-5B-1: Purpose
13-5B-2: Permitted And Conditional Uses
13-5B-3: Lot And Bulk Standards
13-5B-4: Mobile Home Parks
13-5B-5: Multiple-Family Dwelling Developments
13-5B-6: Residential Exterior Materials And Design
13-5B-7: General Provisions
13-5B-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   R-1 Zone: The single-family residential (R-1) zones are established to
encourage and promote an environment for family life by providing areas for
single-family detached dwellings on individual lots and associated uses as
defined in this article. This zone is characterized by attractively landscaped
lots and open spaces with lawns and shrubs.
   B.   R-2 Zone: The two-family residential (R-2) zone is established to
provide a residential environment within the city which is characterized by
attractively landscaped single-family and two-family residential lots and
structures and associated uses as defined in this article. This zone is
intended to have a residential density slightly higher than the R-1 zone, but
to maintain a residential character comparable to that of a single-family
residential area.
   C.   R-3 Zone: The multiple-family residential (R-3) zone is established to
provide an attractive setting for multiple-family, two-family and single-family
dwellings, and associated uses as defined in this article.
   D.   R-R Zone: The rural residential (R-R) zone is established to provide
areas where single-family residential and associated uses, as defined in this
article, may be harmoniously integrated with incidental agricultural uses. This
zone is intended to allow the keeping of a limited number of farm animals and
fowl in conjunction with single-family dwelling units. It is intended, at the
same time, to retain land in parcels large enough to provide efficient and
attractive development as urban uses extend in an orderly manner into these
areas. The R-R zone is also intended to accommodate residential developments
which are oriented to an equestrian lifestyle. This would allow the design of a
residential community which could contain noncommercial stables, training areas
and equestrian trails as an integral part of the development.
   E.   R-E Zone: The residential estate (R-E) zone is established to provide
areas where detached single-family dwellings and associated uses, as defined in
this article, may be harmoniously integrated with the environment in large lot
developments. This zone is characterized by open land that is interspersed with
residential dwellings with attractively landscaped lots. This zone does not
allow for the keeping of farm animals and fowl in conjunction with single-
family dwellings.
   F.   R-M Zone: The mobile home residential (R-M) zone is established to
provide a residential environment primarily for mobile and manufactured homes,
either within an established mobile home park under one ownership, or within a
mobile home subdivision under multiple ownership. The zone is intended to
assure a high degree of compatibility between mobile home parks and adjacent
residential development of other types.
   G.   Collective Title: The foregoing zones are collectively referred to as
"residential zones". (2001 Code § 89-3-301; amd. 2009 Code)
13-5B-2: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
Uses allowed in residential zones are listed in the table below. Those uses
identified as "permitted" (P) are allowed by right; provided, that they comply
with all other requirements of this article and all other applicable
requirements of this title. Uses identified as "conditional" (C) must be
approved by the planning commission pursuant to the standards and procedures
for conditional uses set forth in chapter 7, article E of this title and title
15 of this code, and comply with all other applicable requirements of this
title. Uses identified as "administrative conditional uses" (AC) shall be
approved by the zoning administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in
chapter 7, article E of this title, except that the public hearing shall be
conducted by the zoning administrator, and shall comply with title 15 of this
code and all other applicable requirements of this title. Uses not specifically
listed in this section shall not be allowed in residential zones.

Note:
   1.   A manufactured or modular housing structure, constructed to applicable
federal or state construction standards, shall be deemed to be a permitted use
if occupied as a single-family residence and may be located within this zoning
district as though the structure were constructed on the site according to the
international building code and other applicable standards if the structure
meets or exceeds the pertinent provisions of this article for minimum living
space, setback, side yard, required attached 2 car garage, and other similar
building and zoning requirements.

Remaining land not used for mobile or manufactured homes, roads or parking
shall be set aside and developed as recreation and service areas for common use
and enjoyment of occupants of the park.
   C.   The setback and spacing requirements of this article shall apply in all
mobile home parks.
   D.   Not less than eight percent (8%) of the gross area of any mobile home
park shall be set aside for the joint use of occupants. The land covered by
vehicular roadways, sidewalks and off street parking shall not be construed as
meeting this requirement.
   E.   Central recreation facilities shall be established in each mobile home
park pursuant to the provisions of this title. The size of such recreation area
shall be at least two hundred (200) square feet for each mobile home lot or

   G.   Mobile or manufactured home spaces within a mobile home park shall not
be used for transient trailer sites. Such spaces shall be occupied only by
mobile or manufactured homes which are placed upon piers or jacks and attached
to public utilities. No lot or space shall be rented or leased for a period
less than thirty (30) days.
   H.   A lighted directory map showing streets, lot numbers and location of
the manager's office and other facilities in the mobile home park shall be
clearly displayed at the entrance of any mobile home park, but not closer than
fifty feet (50') from the designated right of way line of a public street.
   I.   Every mobile home park shall include a permanent building for office
and administrative use. The building may include a single-family dwelling for
the exclusive use of the owner or manager.
   J.   Skirting materials shall be provided entirely around the periphery of
each mobile or manufactured home to conceal the open area beneath the
structure. The skirting material shall be of durable construction and shall be
compatible with the exterior finish of the mobile or manufactured home unit.
   K.   All parks shall be provided with safe, convenient, all season
pedestrian access of at least three feet (3') in width. The access shall
provide both a common walkway system and individual walks to each unit.
   L.   The owner or joint owners of a mobile home park shall ensure proper
maintenance of all landscaping, fencing, grounds, utility services, lighting
and storm drainage, and otherwise comply with provisions of all city ordinances
regarding buildings and uses of land.
   M.   Additions or attachments to mobile or manufactured homes in mobile home
parks such as carports, covered patios, screen rooms or approved manufactured
additions which meet HUD construction standards for mobile or manufactured
homes may be approved by the city administrator or his designee. The planning
commission may by conditional use permit authorize other additions and
attachments. (2001 Code § 89-3-304; amd. Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective at

22 or less units/acre (R-3-22)       2
 
   B.   Multiple-family dwelling developments having more than two (2) floors
that abut a single-family or two-family residential subdivision or development
shall be set back a minimum of thirty feet (30') from all property lines and
fifty feet (50') from the designated right-of- way lines of public streets.
(2001 Code § 89-3-305; amd. 2009 Code)
13-5B-6: RESIDENTIAL EXTERIOR MATERIALS AND DESIGN:
   A.   Exterior Masonry Required: Brick or stone shall be required on the
exterior of all dwellings. The minimum area (A) of brick or stone required
(measured in square feet) shall be determined by multiplying the outside
perimeter (P) of the foundation (measured in feet), including the garage, by
two feet (2') (P x 2 = A).
   B.   Exception To Masonry Requirement: In order to encourage a variety of
architectural design in residential construction, the requirement for exterior
masonry may be modified if not less than four (4) of the following
architectural features are combined in a design to create an overall
architectural style for a residential building:

13-5B-7: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Status Of Performance Overlay Zones: All performance overlay zones
existing at the time of adoption hereof shall be nonconforming. A parcel of
vacant land within a performance overlay zone may be developed in conformance
with the provisions of the previously existing performance overlay zone
requirements and platted as a Performance Subdivision (P-S) or Performance
Development (P-D). (The Performance Subdivision and Performance Development
Overlay Zones were established and defined in a predecessor ordinance known as
title 10 (1982-2000).) A lot within a Performance Subdivision or Performance
Development, meeting all requirements of the prior existing regulations related
to performance overlay zones, shall not be denied a building permit solely for
reasons of nonconformance with the requirements of this article.
   B.   Animal Limitations: The maintenance and keeping of animals and fowl on
a lot in a rural residential zone, where such use is permitted, shall be
limited to a total of twenty (20) animal points per ten thousand (10,000)
square feet, as determined from the chart in this section. A minimum of twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet is required for the keeping of animals or fowl.
Legally created lots in rural residential zones that are between eighteen
thousand (18,000) square feet and twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall be
deemed to meet the twenty thousand (20,000) square feet minimum and point
qualifications. All animals located on a lot of land shall be contained upon
said lot. The number of animals determined from the chart below for a
particular property (except as expressly provided otherwise) does not include
the offspring of any large or medium sized animal which offspring is less than
twelve (12) months of age; and also does not include one litter, kindle or
clutch of offspring of a small animal up to the twelve (12) months of age;

13-5C-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Planned Residential Development Zone: The purpose of the Planned
Residential Development (PRD) Zone is to encourage imaginative, creative and
efficient utilization of land by establishing development standards that
provide design flexibility, allow integration of compatible residential uses,
encourage consolidation of open spaces, clustering of dwelling units, and
optimum land planning with greater efficiency, convenience and amenity than may
be possible under the procedures and regulations of conventional zoning
classifications. A Planned Residential Development should incorporate a
diversity of architectural design throughout the project. A diversity of
architecture creates "timeless" communities that do not become dated or go out
of style.
   B.   Planned Community Zone: The purpose of the Planned Community (PC) Zone
is to encourage imaginative and efficient utilization of land through the
clustering of buildings, and the integration of compatible uses (i.e.,
residential, commercial, recreational). The mix of uses is encouraged in order
to create a convenient, efficient and effective integration of uses that create
an attractive and desirable environment where employment, residential uses and
leisure are close to each other. This zone is characterized by attractive
buildings within a well-planned setting. It is also characterized by a design
intended to mitigate the negative effects of noise, traffic and undue
congestion.
   C.   Overall Intent: It is the intent of the City that the site and building
plans for planned developments be prepared by a designer or team of designers
having professional competence in urban planning, site planning, and
architectural and landscape architectural design. However, it is not the City's
intent that design control be so rigidly exercised that individual initiative
is stifled or that substantial additional expense is incurred. Rather, it is
the intent of this section that the control exercised be the minimum necessary
to achieve the purpose of this chapter. The intent of planned developments (PC
or PRD) is to:
      1.   Create more attractive and more desirable environments in the City;
      2.   Allow a variety of uses and structures;
      3.   Encourage imaginative concepts in the design of neighborhood housing
and mixed use projects;
      4.   Provide flexibility in the location of buildings on the land;
      5.   Facilitate and encourage social and community interaction and
activity among those who live within a neighborhood;
      6.   Encourage the creation of a distinctive visual character and
identity for each planned development;
      7.   Produce a market-balanced and coordinated mixture of residential
uses and related public areas and design integrated private commercial
facilities;
      8.   Encourage a range of housing types, including owner and renter
occupied units, single-family detached dwellings and multiple- family
structures, as well as other structural types;
      9.   Preserve and take the greatest possible aesthetic advantage of
existing trees and other natural site features and, in order to do so, minimize
the amount of grading necessary for construction of a development;
      10.   Provide land for the community and public at large for recreation
and social purposes;
      11.   Achieve physical and aesthetic integration of uses and activities
within each development;
      12.   Develop pedestrian circulation networks separated from vehicular
roadways in order to create linkages between residential areas, open spaces,
recreational areas and public and private facilities;
      13.   Planned developments are best realized in large scale developments,
therefore, development on a large, planned scale is required;
      14.   Assure compatibility and coordination of each development with
existing and proposed surrounding land uses;
      15.   Plan for a minimum of five percent (5%) and no more than ten
percent (10%) of the overall development unit count as affordable housing as
defined in Utah Code. Affordable housing shall be integrated into neighborhoods
of comparably sized market rate homes. (2001 Code § 89-3-401; amd. Ord. 19-13,
5-8-2019)
13-5C-2: PROCESS FOR ZONE CHANGE TO PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGNATION; MASTER
DEVELOPMENT PLAN REQUIRED:
   A.   Feasibility: Before application is made for a zone change to the
Planned Development PC or PRD Zone, the entity proposing the change shall first
meet with the City to review and assess the feasibility of the change.
   B.   Approval Criteria: An application for a zone change to a PC or PRD Zone
shall include a Master Development Plan ("MDP") and shall be submitted,
according to section
13-5J-10 of this chapter, concurrently with and as part of the application for
a zone change. A Master Development Agreement ("MDA") in a form acceptable to
the City shall also be required and presented to the Planning Commission as
part of the application review prior to consideration of the application by the
City Council. The MDP shall follow the expiration time frames of subsection
13-5J-10D of this chapter, or as modified by the MDP and/or the MDA. The MDP
shall be attached to and be part of the MDA.
   C.   Design Guidelines: Design guidelines shall be submitted with each MDP
and shall be approved by the City Council, after receiving a recommendation
from the Planning Commission and the Design Review Committee.
   D.   Phase Sub-Area Development Plans: Each phase described in an MDP shall
be submitted in the form of a Phase Sub-Area Development Plan, following the
standards and guidelines established in the MDP, and shall be approved by City
staff, unless density bonuses are requested. In this case, City Council
approval is required, after a Planning Commission recommendation.
   E.   Ownership At Time Of Application: Each planned residential development
shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of application, or the
subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of the property.
   F.   Specification Of Mixed Uses In PC Zones: The general categories of uses
to be established in a Planned Community Zone shall be specified in the MDP.
The areas to be devoted to each of the land use classifications shall be
clearly shown in the MDP, together with the acreage of each land use area. The
following classifications should be used in making these designations:
      1.   Commercial.
      2.   Multi-family residential.
      3.   Single-family residential.
      4.   Institutional (schools, churches, etc.).
      5.   Recreational and amenities (specified types).
   G.   Conditions Of Approval: The City Council may impose conditions on the
approval of the MDP in order to ensure that:
      1.   The applicant has the financial capability to carry out the proposed
project;
      2.   The development will be planned as one integrated land use rather
than as an aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings, uses or
developments;
      3.   The development as planned and shown in the MDP will accomplish the
purpose and intent of this article;
      4.   An accurate phasing plan for the development is provided showing
that each phase can operate independently without relying on a subsequent
phase;
      5.   The phasing of amenities; and
      6.   The type and amount of open space and amenities are determined and
described in the MDP and not in the development plans of individual phases
(Phase Development Plans). (2001 Code § 89-3-402; amd. Ord. 13-33, 11-13-2013;
Ord. 16-21, 5-11-2016; Ord. 19-13, 5-8-2019)
13-5C-3: DENSITY DESIGNATIONS:
Density in Planned Development Zones is calculated by dividing the number of
proposed dwelling units by the number of gross acres designated for residential
development shown in the Master Development Plan. Proposed parks and public or
private open space, roads and trails may be included in determining the number
of acres used in this calculation. However, areas proposed for nonresidential
uses (i.e., commercial, office, church or school sites) shall not be used in
determining residential density. Density ranges for subcategories of planned
developments are specified below. If a proposed development does not qualify
for bonus density as outlined in subsection
13-5C-8B of this article, the minimum density shall apply.
   A.   Density In PRD Zones:
      1.   PRD(L): The PRD(L) classification typically will be used in
conjunction with areas that are designated as "low density" on the general land
use map. Densities may range from 1.0 unit per acre to 3.0 units per acre.
      2.   PRD(M): The PRD(M) classification typically will be used in
conjunction with areas that are designated as "medium density" on the general
land use map. Densities may range from 3.1 units per acre to 5.5 units per
acre.
      3.   PRD(H): The PRD(H) classification typically will be used in
conjunction with areas that are designated as "high density" on the general
land use map. Densities may range from 5.6 units per acre to ten (10) units per
acre.
      4.   PRD(MF): The PRD(MF) classification typically will be used in
conjunction with areas that are designated as "very high density" on the
general land use map. Densities may range from 10.1 units per acre to twenty
four (24) units per acre.
   B.   Density In PC Zones: To the extent maximum density is not established
by the TSOD or other applicable overlay zone, final density in PC Zones shall
be approved as part of Master Development Plan approval by the City Council
after receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission. (2001 Code § 89-
3-403; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-20, 7-28-2010; Ord. 19-13, 5-8-2019)
13-5C-4: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Uses allowed in Planned Development Zones are listed in the table
below. Those uses identified as "permitted" (P) are allowed by right; provided,
that they comply with all other requirements of this article and all other
applicable requirements of this title. Uses identified as "conditional" (C)
must be approved by the Planning Commission pursuant to the standards and
procedures for conditional uses set forth in chapter 7, article E of this title
and title 15 of this Code, and comply with all other applicable requirements of
this title. Uses identified as "administrative conditional uses" (AC) shall be
approved by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in
chapter 7, article E of this title, except that the public hearing shall be
conducted by the Zoning Administrator, and shall comply with title 15 of this
Code, and all other applicable requirements of this title. Uses not
specifically listed in this section shall not be allowed in Planned Development
Zones.

   A.   Minimum Site Area:
      1.   PRD Zones: No Planned Residential Development shall have an area
less than twenty (20) acres, except that the City Council may approve a rezone
request to the Planned Residential Development Zone classification for a parcel
smaller than twenty (20) acres if: a) the applicant can reasonably show that
the surrounding neighborhood will not be adversely affected by the granting of
such zone classification; and b) the provisions of this article will be
complied with. No Planned Residential Development shall have an area greater
than thirty (30) acres.
      2.   PC Zones: The minimum size for a Planned Community Zone shall be two
hundred (200) undeveloped acres, except that the City Council may approve a

SECTION:
13-5D-1: Purpose
13-5D-2: Permitted And Conditional Uses
13-5D-3: Lot And Bulk Standards
13-5D-4: General Provisions
13-5D-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   P-O Zone: The professional office (P-O) zone is established to provide
areas where professional and business offices, laboratories, studios and other
office related facilities may be located in the city. The intent of this zone
is to allow only those uses that will promote a professional office
environment. Uses which produce loud noises, excessive vehicle traffic,
excessive parking needs, objectionable odors, storage of large amounts of
hazardous substances, or the outside storage of inventory or equipment, are not
appropriate in this zoning district. Developments in the P-O zone should be
designed to create an appropriate environment in which professional and
business services can be conducted. Buildings, signs and other structures
within this zone should be planned so as to be architecturally compatible with
their surroundings. The P-O zone is considered to be an ideal buffer zone
between commercial or manufacturing zones and residential zones.
   B.   BR-P Zone: The business and research park zone (BR-P) is intended for
the establishment and preservation of areas designed for research, development,
scientific and business endeavors conducted in a park like setting. Some light
manufacturing uses are appropriate and may be associated with research
intensive industries. All uses in the BR-P zone should be conducted in well
designed, architecturally appealing buildings, surrounded with abundant
landscaped open space. Access, parking and utility areas should be designed to
enhance the park like atmosphere and the convenience of workers and visitors.
Uses in this zone should not have characteristics of heavy manufacturing zones
such as excessive noise and light, unpleasant odors or fumes, pollution and
numerous heavy vehicles. This zone should act as a suitable and compatible
buffer for high quality residential areas. The BR-P zone should not, however,
be established for the purpose of creating a buffer unless it is located so as
to be accessible to arterial streets, provides adequate space for unified and
functional development and supports the general plan of the city.
      1.   Lots or parcels of land shall not be rezoned to the business and
research park zone unless the city council finds the proposed BR-P zone will:
         a.   Be in compliance with the goals and policies of the general plan,
or a variation from the general plan or land use plan can be justified;
         b.   Not encourage strip or spot development or incompatible land
uses;
         c.   Encourage orderly development, not leapfrogged or sprawled
development, and will not place excessive demands on city services;
         d.   Encourage sensitivity to the natural and historical features of
the land and enhance the urban environment;
         e.   Enhance the economic condition of the city and contribute to a
well rounded community; and
         f.   Promote the safety and convenience of the city residents and
businesses.
      2.   Any area of land that is to be divided into two (2) or more parcels
in the BR-P zone shall be platted as a subdivision in accordance with the
subdivision procedures set forth in title 14 of this code. In addition to the
standard plat requirements, landscaped open spaces shall be designated on the
plat.
      3.   Each business and research park zone shall have a minimum area of
twenty (20) acres.
   C.   Collective Title: The foregoing zones are collectively referred to as
"office and research park zones". (2001 Code § 89-3-501)
13-5D-2: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
Uses allowed in office and research park zones are listed in the table below.
Those uses identified as "permitted" (P) are allowed by right; provided, that
they comply with all requirements of this article, and all other applicable
requirements of this title. Uses identified as "conditional" (C) must be
approved by the Planning Commission pursuant to the standards and procedures
for conditional uses set forth in chapter 7, article E of this title and title
15 of this Code, and comply with all other applicable requirements of this
title. Uses identified as "administrative conditional uses" (AC) shall be
approved by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in
chapter 7, article E of this title, except that the public hearing shall be
conducted by the Zoning Administrator, and shall comply with title 15 of this
Code, and all other applicable requirements of this title. Uses not
specifically listed in this section shall not be allowed in office and research
park zones.

1.   Unless a conditional use permit has been granted to allow greater height.
   B.   Lot Frontage:
      1.   Each lot shall have a minimum of fifty feet (50') of frontage on a
public right of way. The frontage requirement does not apply to lots which are
developed in conjunction with an approved site plan where a private street,
deeded right of way, easement or similar real instrument provides assurance to
the city that any property not meeting the above minimum requirement will have
guaranteed access to and from the site.
      2.   Irregular shaped lots located along the circular portion of a cul-
de-sac or a knuckle portion of a street may be reduced to a minimum of thirty
five feet (35') of lot frontage at the front property line adjacent to the
right of way. (2001 Code § 89-3-503; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011)
13-5D-4: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Uses Within Buildings: All uses in the BR-P zone shall be conducted
entirely within permanent, enclosed buildings that have been approved for such
uses. No storage of inventory, supplies, equipment or any other materials shall
be conducted outside of the buildings, nor shall any activity associated with
the use of the premises be conducted in the outdoors, except for necessary
parking, access, landscaping, utility areas and approved open space.
   B.   Landscaping: All uses in office and research park zones shall comply
with the provisions governing landscaping in chapter 13 of this title.
   C.   Parking And Loading: All uses in office and research park zones shall
comply with the provisions governing off street parking in chapter 12 of this
title.
   D.   Signs: All signs in office and research park zones shall comply with
the provisions governing signs in this title and title 12 of this code.
   E.   Building Architecture: The following architectural requirements shall
apply in the P-O and BR-P zones:
      1.   Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality,
durable materials, including, but not limited to, brick, rock, sandstone,
steel, stone, stucco, glass, synthetic stone, tinted/textured concrete masonry
units, wood and masonry fiberboard simulating wood. Window and entry systems
shall utilize baked on or anodized finishes.
      2.   Street and site lighting and signs, benches, bus shelters, walkways,
streets, utility structures, walls, sculptures, and all other physical features
and amenities, should be harmoniously designed to reflect continuity and
identity.

ARTICLE E.  COMMERCIAL ZONES
SECTION:
13-5E-1: Purpose
13-5E-2: Establishment Standards
13-5E-3: Permitted And Conditional Uses
13-5E-4: Lot And Bulk Standards
13-5E-5: General Provisions
13-5E-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   C-G Zone: The general commercial (C-G) zone is established to provide a
district primarily for the accommodation of commercial uses and commercial
areas which have been established in locations away from the central core of
the city and which are not planned "shopping centers". Though this zone will be
applied to areas that have developed as strip commercial developments along
major streets and highways, it shall not be used to promote or establish areas
in which such development can be promulgated or encouraged in violation of good
planning principles. The C-G zone should be applied to vacant land areas for
new construction only if integrated shopping center development is not
practical and/or desirable because of difficult size, shape, topography or
similar problems related to land that would otherwise be considered appropriate
for commercial development. Though the C-G zone may be applied to existing
commercial areas which have a variety of characteristics, the provisions
contained in this article should be used to encourage greater integrity and
aesthetic improvements as these areas are redeveloped, expanded and improved.
Integrated and coordinated landscaping, parking, ingress and egress, signage,
and pleasing architectural design should be encouraged and regulated through
the use of site plan approval procedures. New construction should be in harmony
with the characteristics of the surrounding developed commercial and
residential areas. Uses in this zone will include a wide range of retail and
service stores and shops. Though the zone may be applied to some areas which
have existing office, heavy commercial and institutional uses, these are
excluded as permitted uses in this article to protect the future integrity of
the C-G zone, as well as those zones that are intended to accommodate such
office, heavy commercial and institutional uses.
   B.   C-M Zone: The heavy commercial (C-M) zone is established to provide an
area in which a congruous mixture of retail, commercial warehousing, heavy
commercial and light manufacturing uses may be located. The zone is to be used
primarily as a transitional zone between industrial areas and residential areas
and/or lighter commercial districts. The zone is also intended to provide for
the location of manufacturing and warehousing operations that are operated in
conjunction with and incidental to a retail commercial establishment. The uses
characteristic of this zone will be warehouses, light manufacturing or assembly
plants, machine shops, automobile repair facilities, furniture and appliance
repair, tire recapping, and building materials stores and yards. Buildings and
grounds that combine utility and attractive appearance should characterize the
C-M zone. The utility of buildings, parking areas and loading facilities should
be softened with landscaped areas along all street frontages.
   C.   SC-1 Zone: The neighborhood shopping center (SC-1) zone is established
to provide an area in which the primary use of the land is for commercial and
service uses to serve the daily convenience needs of the surrounding
residential neighborhood. The SC-1 zone is intended to be located within
neighborhood areas and to be integrated into the residential structure of a
neighborhood in a manner that will create a minimum of detriment, hazard or
inconvenience to surrounding residential development. Each neighborhood
shopping center zone will be small. It is intended that the SC-1 zone shall be
characterized by a harmonious grouping of commercial stores and shops that will
be architecturally designed, and will function, as an integrated unit. The
architectural design and character should also be compatible with that of the
surrounding residential environment. Clean, well lighted parking lots and
attractive well maintained shops with appropriate landscaping will also be
characteristic of this zone. Lighting will be of a relatively low intensity and
low profile with adequate shielding to protect surrounding residential areas.
Uses permitted within the SC-1 zone will be those which will create no
detriment to the surrounding residential areas, and will generally serve only
the daily convenience needs of the residential neighborhood. Dwellings,
industries, recreational uses, or other heavy commercial uses that tend to
thwart and discourage the use of the land within this zone for its primary
purpose have been excluded. Typical uses allowed in this zone are small
convenience grocery stores, variety stores, shoe shops, dry cleaning pick up
stations, self-service laundries, and barber or beauty shops.
   D.   SC-2 Zone: The community shopping center (SC-2) zone is established to
provide an area in which a general shopping center facility can be established
to satisfy the specialty shopping needs of a community or a group of
neighborhoods. The services provided in an SC-2 zone will normally serve a
trade area population of ten thousand (10,000) to seventy thousand (70,000)
people. Specialty shops situated in an attractively designed shopping center
complex surrounded by appropriate landscaping will characterize the SC-2 zone.
A junior department store and a supermarket will characterize uses permitted in
the SC-2 zone as anchors, and by a wide range of restaurants, specialty shops,
and hard goods or soft goods stores.
   E.   SC-3 Zone: The regional shopping center (SC-3) zone is established to
provide a district in which the primary use of the land is for commercial and
service uses to serve needs of people living in an entire region and to serve
as a place of employment in pleasant surroundings close to the center of the
regional population it is intended to serve. This shopping center zone should
serve a population of at least one hundred thousand (100,000). It is intended
that this zone shall be characterized by a variety of stores, shops and service
buildings grouped into an integrated architectural unit. Required yards and
areas surrounding buildings shall be attractively landscaped and maintained in
harmony with the characteristics of the surrounding residential areas. The uses
characteristic of this zone will be large chain department stores with
satellite shops and facilities serving an extremely wide range of goods and
services with an equally large selection of types and styles. The typical uses
allowed in the zone will include virtually the whole range of retail and
service establishments that can be attractively accommodated within a unified
shopping center complex.
   F.   Collective Title: The zones described in subsections A through E of
this section are collectively referred to as "commercial zones". (2001 Code §
89-3-601)
13-5E-2: ESTABLISHMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   C-G Zone: The location of the C-G zone should be close to major
arterials to provide convenient access for high volumes of traffic without
hazard and without traversing through a residential area. The C-G zone shall
not be applied to the internal areas of residential neighborhoods. Each single
C-G zoning district shall contain a minimum of two (2) acres, except those
existing, previously developed commercial facilities and areas to which the C-
G zone is applied at the time the zone is created.
   B.   C-M Zone: The C-M zone should be located in those areas where it
provides service as a transitional zone and where there is adequate
accessibility to major transportation facilities. Care should be taken in the
location of this zone to ensure that heavy volumes of truck traffic generated
by warehousing and light manufacturing uses do not traverse through a
residential neighborhood or retail commercial area in order to reach major
highways or rail facilities. Each single C-M zone shall contain a minimum of
five (5) acres. The C-M zone may be applied to an existing commercial area that
does not meet these area requirements, provided the existing commercial
facilities to which the zone is being applied are in compliance with the
purpose and objectives of this zone.
   C.   SC-1 Zone: The SC-1 zone shall be located generally in conformance with
the provisions of the city general plan. This zone may, however, be located in
areas deemed appropriate for the service of a residential neighborhood. Each
single SC-1 neighborhood shopping center zone shall contain a minimum of one
acre and a maximum of ten (10) acres. Properties less than one acre may be
approved by the city council, provided the parking access, landscaping and
setback requirements can be met.
   D.   SC-2 Zone: The SC-2 zone should be located adjacent to major
thoroughfares or collector streets that will provide immediate access for
automobile traffic without passing through residential areas. Each SC-2 zone
shall contain a minimum of five (5) acres and a maximum of twenty five (25)
acres. The SC-2 zone shall not be applied to an existing commercial area that
does not meet these area requirements and shall not be applied to existing
commercial development that has not been designed and constructed as an
integrated shopping center.
   E.   SC-3 Zone: The SC-3 zone should be located close to freeways and
adjacent to major arterials to provide convenient access for major traffic
volumes without hazard and without traversing through a residential area. Each
single SC-3 Shopping Center Zone shall contain a minimum of twenty five (25)
acres. The SC-3 Zone shall not be applied to an existing commercial area that
does not meet these area requirements and shall not be applied to existing
commercial development that has not been designed and constructed as an
integrated shopping center. The SC-3 Zone shall incorporate mass transit and
pedestrian access into and throughout the development.
   F.   Inclusion Of Abutting Zones: All commercial zoning districts, which do
not meet the minimum area requirement, may include abutting commercial zones in
the calculation if the abutting commercial facilities and uses are, or will be,
in compliance with the purpose and objective of the zone. (2001 Code § 89-3-
602; amd. Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011)
13-5E-3: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
Uses allowed in commercial zones are listed in the table below. Those uses
identified as "permitted" (P) are allowed by right; provided, that they comply
with all other requirements of this article, and all other applicable
requirements of this title. Uses identified as "conditional" (C) must be
approved by the Planning Commission pursuant to the standards and procedures
for conditional uses set forth in chapter 7, article E of this title and title
15 of this Code, and comply with all other applicable requirements of this
title. Uses identified as "administrative conditional uses" (AC) shall be
approved by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in
chapter 7, article E of this title, except that the public hearing shall be
conducted by the Zoning Administrator, and shall comply with title 15 of this
Code, and all other applicable requirements of this title. Uses not
specifically listed in this section shall not be allowed in commercial zones.

Notes:
1.   In areas developed prior to establishment of the C-G zone, the front yard
setback shall be the average setback of all properties on the same block face,
except that no commercial building shall be located closer than 20 feet to any
residential district boundary line or street that continues as frontage into a
residential district.
2.   The side yard setback in C-G zones may be reduced or eliminated if the
general plan recommends that the site be commercial or industrial and all
engineering and fire code requirements are met.
   B.   Lot Frontage:
      1.   Each lot shall have the minimum frontage on a public street
specified in the table below. This frontage requirement shall not apply to lots
which are developed in conjunction with an approved site plan where a private
street, deeded right of way, easement or similar real instrument provides
assurance to the city that any property not meeting the above minimum
requirement will have guaranteed access to and from the site.
 
Minimum Lot Frontage       Zones
35 feet                    C-G, C-M
50 feet                    SC-1
200 feet for a development SC-2
500 feet for a development SC-3
 
      2.   Irregular shaped lots located along the circular portion of a cul-
de-sac or a knuckle portion of a street may be reduced to a minimum of thirty
five feet (35') of lot frontage at the right of way line.
   C.   Increased Side Yards For Driveway Access: When a side yard in any
commercial zone is to be used for access to parking areas, minimum setbacks
shall be increased to:
      1.   Twelve feet (12') when access is provided for not more than five (5)
parking spaces, or when a one-way driveway is provided for more than five (5)
parking spaces;
      2.   Sixteen feet (16') when a two-way driveway is provided for access to
six (6) or more parking spaces.
   D.   Adjacent To Residential: When adjacent to a residential zone or use,
minimum setback is twenty feet (20'), plus one foot (1') for every foot of
building height over thirty five feet (35'). (2001 Code § 89-3-604; amd. 2009
Code; Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011)
13-5E-5: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Uses Within Buildings: All uses shall be conducted entirely within a
fully enclosed building, except those uses that the planning commission
determines are customarily and appropriately conducted outside. Such uses may
include, but are not limited to, service stations, ice skating, garden centers,
miniature golf, etc. Outside storage of materials and equipment in the C-M zone
may occur only when fully screened from public view by an opaque fence or wall
approved by the planning commission in conjunction with the issuance of a
conditional use permit for such use.
   B.   Consolidation Of Lots: Lots or parcels of land for which an SC-3 zoning
designation is requested shall be consolidated, if necessary, to meet the
minimum area requirements of the zone either prior to or concurrently with the
establishment of the zone.
   C.   Standards For Check Cashing Credit Service, Pawnshop Or Bail Bond Uses:
      1.   No check cashing credit service, pawnshop or bail bond use shall be
located within one thousand feet (1,000') from any other check cashing credit
service, pawnshop or bail bond use. Distances shall be measured in a straight
line, without regard to intervening structures or zoning districts, from the
entry door of each business.
      2.   A maximum of twelve (12) check cashing credit service businesses,
three (3) pawnshop businesses, and six (6) bail bond service businesses shall
be allowed in the city.
   D.   Access In SC-3 Zones: Primary access to a regional shopping center
shall not be provided from a cul-de-sac street.
   E.   Landscaping: All uses in commercial zones shall comply with the
provisions governing landscaping in chapter 13 of this title.
   F.   Parking And Loading: All uses in commercial zones shall comply with the
provisions governing off street parking in chapter 12 of this title.
   G.   Signs: All signs in commercial zones shall comply with the provisions
governing signs in this title and title 12 of this code. (2001 Code § 89-3-605;

SECTION:
13-5F-1: Purpose
13-5F-2: Permitted And Conditional Uses
13-5F-3: Lot And Bulk Standards
13-5F-4: General Provisions
13-5F-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   M-P Zone: The Manufacturing Park (M-P) Zone is established to allow the
development of light industrial uses which are compatible with and complement
Commercial or Residential Zones. The M-P Zone is best used as a transitional
zone between M-1 Zones and other zoning districts, but may also be appropriate
in other areas. The M-P Zone is generally characterized by inoffensive land
uses conducted primarily within masonry or concrete buildings located within a
well landscaped, parklike setting. The upgraded architecture and landscaping in
M-P Zones is intended to be compatible with Nonmanufacturing Zones.
   B.   M-1 Zone: The Light Manufacturing (M-1) Zone is established to provide
areas suited to general manufacturing, assembly, repair and storage. The M-
1 Zone is considered to be the most intensive zone that will provide industrial
areas in the City that are free from extreme nuisances and dangerous
conditions. M-1 Zones should be located away from residential areas and should
be buffered from other less intensive zones.
   C.   M-2 Zone: The Major Manufacturing (M-2) Zone is established to provide
larger lots and areas for major operations related to manufacturing, assembly
and distribution. Most uses allowed in this zone are also allowed in the M-
1 Zone, but are generally larger scale as dictated by minimum building and lot
sizes. M-2 Zones should be well buffered from residential areas.
   D.   Collective Title: The zones described in this section are collectively
referred to as the "Manufacturing Zones". (2001 Code §89-3-701)
13-5F-2: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
Uses allowed in Manufacturing Zones are listed in the table below. Those uses
identified as "permitted" (P) are allowed by right; provided, that they comply
with all other requirements of this article, and all other applicable
requirements of this title. Uses identified as "conditional" (C) must be
approved by the Planning Commission pursuant to the standards and procedures
for conditional uses set forth in chapter 7, article E of this title and title
15 of this Code, and comply with all other applicable requirements of this
title. Uses identified as "administrative conditional uses" (AC) shall be
approved by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in
chapter 7, article E of this title, except that the public hearing shall be
conducted by the Zoning Administrator, and shall comply with title 15 of this
Code, and all other applicable requirements of this title. Uses not
specifically listed in this section shall not be allowed in Manufacturing
Zones.

13-5H-6: General Provisions
13-5H-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the parks, recreation and open space (PRO) zone
is to identify and protect public and private recreation facilities, to
preserve significant natural and visual resources in the city, and to promote
the public health, safety and welfare by providing land use controls for these
areas. Specifically, the PRO zone is intended to:
      1.   Implement the general plan by identifying, providing and preserving
a variety of parks, recreation areas and open spaces in order to improve the
quality of life for residents of the city;
      2.   Encourage residential development that preserves space for parks,
open spaces and trails;
      3.   Provide a balance between active and passive recreation
opportunities to meet neighborhood and community needs;
      4.   Conserve the character of the natural landscape and provide
opportunities for hiking, horseback riding and bicycling in a natural setting;
      5.   Promote continuing economic benefit to the region by protecting
natural open space for the visual and recreational enjoyment of residents and
visitors;
      6.   Preserve all wildlife habitat, wetlands, native vegetation and other
sensitive lands that will provide an interconnected system of permanent open
space;
      7.   Facilitate preservation of scenic and natural resources and
ecosystem management; and
      8.   Identify and preserve significant historic and cultural resources.
   B.   Open Space Maintenance: It is also the purpose of this article to
establish minimum standards for maintenance of public or private common open
space within all proposed residential developments. (2001 Code § 89-3-901; amd.
2009 Code)
13-5H-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Parks: The PRO zone should be applied to areas designated as "parks and
open land" or "future parks" on the general plan land use map.
   B.   Open Space: The PRO zone should be applied to sites which are
appropriate for open space preservation due to the presence of unique
topographic features, hazards related to geology or soils, significant
vegetation, wildlife habitat, natural drainage corridors, agricultural value or
flood hazard.
   C.   Dedications And Donations: The PRO zone may be applied by the city to
land that is to be preserved for public use by an easement, or is dedicated
and/or donated to the city or other entity for development of parks or
recreation facilities. (2001 Code § 89-3-902)
13-5H-3: PARKS, RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE RESERVATION:
   A.   Required Reservation: Sites designated for public or private parks,
recreation and/or common open space shall be provided consistent with the
general plan and the West Jordan "Parks, Recreation, Trails And Open Space
Handbook" in all developments for which an application is received after the
effective date hereof. The planning commission, in its review of each
development, shall require that land be reserved and improvements installed by
the developer for parks, trails, playgrounds or other recreation purposes in
locations designated on the general plan and/or the West Jordan "Parks,
Recreation, Trails And Open Space Handbook" or otherwise where such
reservations would be appropriate. In general, land reserved for new parks or
recreational purposes shall have an area of at least ten (10) acres.
   B.   Qualifying Land: Sites that may be used to meet the park, recreation
and/or open space requirement of this section may include:
      1.   Public or private parks and playgrounds;
      2.   Areas occupied by special recreation amenities, such as clubhouses,
swimming pools, tennis courts or other similar amenities;
      3.   Trail corridors;
      4.   Natural drainage corridors that are required by either subsection
13-6D-4J of this title, or section
8-2-5 of this code, to be preserved; slopes over thirty percent (30%) that are
not included in individual lots.
   C.   Sites Not To Be Considered: Required setbacks and streets, parking
areas, driveways and other similar paved areas shall not be included in
computations of park, recreation and open space reservation. However, the
planning commission may consider, on a case by case basis, including required
landscaped setbacks in R-3-16, R-3-20 and R-3-22 zones in the computation of
open space.
   D.   Consolidation Of Areas: Not less than fifty percent (50%) of the total
required park, recreation and open space reservation shall be in one contiguous
parcel unless, due to the proposed quality, distribution and use of such areas,
modification of this requirement is found to be warranted by the planning
commission.
   E.   Maintenance: The developer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
city that all sites designated as park, recreation and open space facilities
shall be permanently preserved and maintained for their intended purpose
through donation, dedication or conservation easements granted to the city or
other entity. When park or recreational facilities approved for dedication are
completed and accepted, a deed shall be conveyed to the city, after which the
supervision and maintenance shall be the responsibility of the city. All sites
shall be contained entirely within common tracts that are not crossed by
individual property lines. If the property is owned by a homeowners'
association, the property shall be maintained through a common maintenance
agreement. (2001 Code § 89-3-903; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 13-17, 4-24-2013)

13-5I-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of the city center zone is to develop a traditional downtown area,
by redeveloping and restoring pedestrian scale buildings in the traditional
downtown core (city center) of the city. The city center zone is intended to
set apart that portion of the city which forms the center of commercial,
professional, residential, office, municipal and cultural uses by encouraging a
balanced, though concentrated, mix of these uses in a central area of the city.
The city center zone should provide a safe, attractive, pedestrian friendly
environment that will serve as a destination area that will attract people for
a unique shopping, cultural, recreational, professional service and living
experience. The objectives of the city center zone are to:
   A.   Allow land uses that contain a flexible arrangement of residential,
commercial, service, office, retail and mixed use development while adopting
detailed urban design standards to ensure compatibility between the uses and
pedestrian activity;
   B.   Permit and support higher development densities that encourage
utilization of mass transit around the proposed light rail station;
   C.   Facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation and
minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles;
   D.   Minimize distances between destinations by providing for a number of
conveniences and uses, which are compatible with one another and which are
within an approximate one-fourth (1/4) mile walking distance of each other
(i.e., home to office, home to retail service, or office to retail service);
   E.   Encourage mixed use buildings with sidewalk level retail, office and
service uses;
   F.   Establish urban design standards that promote the placement of
buildings near streets while reserving a generous pedestrian zone between
buildings and street curbs;
   G.   Ensure that new buildings are appropriately designed that address human
scale, and become a positive element in the architectural character of a
revitalized downtown core;
   H.   Ensure that large buildings have visually enhanced base and
architectural features on all elevations visible from streets or pedestrian
routes, through such methods as facade modulation, architectural detailing,
roof treatment, fenestration and ground floor transparency;
   I.   Create and enhance cultural use areas that promote regional and local
social activities;
   J.   Provide for an overall development plan which will have economic
viability, where the city will benefit from the finished product as a whole, in
the form of tax increment private investment and will sustain and/or create new
jobs;
   K.   Allow for greater flexibility in street and road design features that
distinguish the area as unique and which creates distinctive ambiance to the
city center zone, but also reduces infrastructure costs through reduced parking
and right of way widths;
   L.   Encourage on street parking and shared parking where appropriate; and
   M.   Integrate open spaces, plazas, courtyards and pocket parks and connect
these areas to all other uses in the city center zone. (2001 Code § 89-3-1001;
amd. 2009 Code)
13-5I-2: ESTABLISHMENT:
The city center will be referred to as not only a zone, but also as a defining
district of that area designated as "town center" on the adopted West Jordan
future land use plan and map. A master plan (or master plans) for the city
center shall be prepared in joint cooperation with the city and property
owners. (2001 Code § 89-3-1002; amd. 2009 Code)
13-5I-3: CITY CENTER ZONING DISTRICTS:
The city center zone consists of three (3) subdistricts, all of which share a
number of transit and pedestrian oriented land use characteristics, each
emphasizing their own land use appropriations based on location. Reference to
the city center zone is intended to describe the entire boundary of all three
(3) subdistricts.
   A.   City Center-Core (CC-C): The CC-C subdistrict is generally described as
an area that is approximately forty two (42) acres in size, an area more
commonly identified as the Briarwood commercial center. This subdistrict is
envisioned to have the highest intensity uses, with a balanced land use mix of
office, retail and service, and mixed use residential and cultural uses within
mid to high rise buildings. Small retail and service shops and restaurants
shall be located along principal pedestrian corridors. Higher intensity uses
shall be located along major public thoroughfares. A major public open space
area should anchor this subdistrict with smaller landscaped areas connecting
the larger open space area in a well planned, but dispersed network of
sidewalks and walkways. Residential land uses in this subdistrict will be
strictly limited to mixed use development, where residential units may be only
located above a more intensive retail, service, office or restaurant use. The
CC-C subdistrict is situated within the transit station overlay district, where
the land use layout of this district will be integral to the functional aspects
of pedestrian activity and commerce.
   B.   City Center-Residential (CC-R): The CC-R subdistrict is generally
described as an area that is approximately twenty seven (27) acres in size, an
area more commonly identified today as the Brookside mobile home estates. This
subdistrict is envisioned to have a mixture of medium to high density housing,
with a small amount of retail, service, office and/or restaurant uses along the
frontage of Redwood Road and the midblock thoroughfares adjacent to the future
light rail station. Though higher in density, this subdistrict is to act as a
buffer between the residential uses to the south and the anticipated higher
densities within the CC-C subdistrict. Public and private open spaces shall be
found throughout the CC-R subdistrict, connected to each other by a well
planned sidewalk system. When this area is redeveloped, Bingham Creek shall be
protected and enhanced as an adequate riparian buffer and corridor, creating a
natural public open space amenity with a multi-use trail.
   C.   City Center-Frame (CC-F):
      1.   The CC-F subdistrict consists of four (4) different areas which
total approximately thirty eight (38) acres in size. This subdistrict is
envisioned to expand upon the existing mixture of auto oriented retail,
service, office and restaurant uses. The city envisions that, over time, the
established uses along the north side of 7800 South and the west side of
Redwood Road will be replaced by uses that are larger in scale, but remain
mostly auto oriented.
      2.   Because of the high traffic patterns of both 7800 South and Redwood
Road, pedestrian connectivity and walkability from the CC-C to the CC-
F subdistricts is not feasible; however, architectural and site design
standards shall be incorporated into this area to establish a "sense of place"
and to act as a gateway to the city center zone. When this area is redeveloped,
Bingham Creek shall be protected and enhanced as an adequate riparian buffer
and corridor, creating a natural public open space amenity with a multi-use
trail.
   D.   Map:
      1.   The following map describes generally the boundaries of the city
center zone subdistricts:

      2.   The city center zone subdistricts are more specifically defined in
the city of West Jordan zoning map. (2001 Code § 89-3-1003; amd. 2009 Code)
13-5I-4: PERMITTED, CONDITIONAL AND PROHIBITED USES:
   A.   Permitted And Conditional Uses: Uses allowed in the city center
subdistricts are listed in the following table. Those uses identified as
"permitted" (P) are allowed by right; provided, that they comply with all other
requirements of this title. Uses identified as "conditional" (C) may be
approved by the planning commission pursuant to the standards and procedures
for conditional uses set forth in chapter 7, article E of this title and title
15 of this code, so long as they comply with all other applicable requirements
of this title. Uses identified as "administrative conditional uses" (AC) shall
be approved by the zoning administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in
chapter 7, article E of this title, except that the public hearing shall be
conducted by the zoning administrator, and shall comply with title 15 of this
code, and all other applicable requirements of this title. Uses not
specifically listed in this section shall not be allowed in the city center
zone.

13-5I-6: STREET TYPES AND STANDARDS:
The street classification system applies to new streets within the city center
zone, where different standards will apply for each type of allowed street. The
three (3) types of streets allowed are:
   A.   Vehicular Street:
      1.   This interior street type will consist of at least one through
travel lane in each direction, one turning lane, and a parking lane on both
sides of the street. The cross section width of a vehicular street is eighty
feet (80') to eighty eight feet (88') in width.
      2.   Vehicular street rights of way are characterized by buildings set
close to a wide sidewalk, street facing facades with no less than fifty percent
(50%) window transparency, shared parking, parking behind buildings, ground
level details, canopy entrances, street trees and furnishings.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3457.gif]
   B.   Pedestrian Street:
      1.   This interior street type will consist of at least one through
travel lane in each direction, a thirteen foot (13') landscaped median between
two (2) travel lanes, and a parking lane on both sides of the street. The cross
section width of a pedestrian street is eighty eight feet (88') to ninety one
feet (91').
      2.   Pedestrian street rights of way are characterized by buildings with
varied setbacks, street facing facades with high percentages of transparency,
parking behind buildings, many ground level building details, direct entrances
to buildings from the sidewalk, overhead weather protection, pedestrian
oriented signs, street trees and furnishings. The landscaped medians shall be
broken in length only by pedestrian crossings, intersections or other
impediments that may be required for safety purposes.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3461.gif]
   D.   Alleys: Alleys are characterized as unnamed public or private rights of
way that are primarily designed to serve as a secondary thoroughfare to the
rear or side of those properties whose principal frontage is on another street.
Commercial properties shall use alleys as efficient rights of way for ingress
and egress to loading dock areas, parking areas or parking structures.
Residential properties shall use alleys as private or public ingress and egress
to garages or parking structures. The cross section width of an alley shall be
no less than twenty feet (20') of paved right of way, which is wide enough for
a single travel lane in each direction. Parking shall not be allowed on any
alley.
   E.   Construction Standards: All streets developed and maintained within the
city center zone shall be constructed to the technical standards established in
this article. If the developer can show that meeting the street type
requirement of this article is impractical because of security requirements,
severe topography or other physical circumstances, the planning commission may
approve modified street standards as part of the final development and site
plan, after receiving recommendation from the city engineer, fire chief and
planning division. An alternate street plan shall not deviate from the intent
of the goals and objectives of creating a pedestrian friendly downtown core.
(2001 Code § 89-3-1006; amd. 2009 Code)
13-5I-7: STREETSCAPE STANDARDS:
   A.   Sidewalks: Public/private sidewalks shall be located along all streets.
Sidewalks shall consist of three (3) zones: an amenity zone, a walking path,
and a dining and/or display area. The dining and/or display area applies only
to vehicular and pedestrian streets. The following regulations shall apply:
      1.   Amenity Zone: All street trees shall be located in a planting area
with a minimum width of five feet (5') between the curb and the walking path of
the sidewalk. This zone is intended for the placement of utility poles, waste
receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic signs, newspaper vending boxes, bus
shelters, bicycle racks, and similar elements in a manner that does not
obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility. Placement of structures in
the amenity zone requires site design approval by the city.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3463.gif]
      2.   Walking Path: Sidewalks shall contain a clear walking path that is a
minimum of five feet (5') and a maximum of thirteen and one-half feet (131/2')
in width depending on the type of street. The walking path shall remain
unobstructed by any permanent or nonpermanent feature for a minimum height of
eight feet (8'), except when utilized as a dining or display area.
      3.   Dining And/Or Display Area (Vehicular And Pedestrian Streets Only):
Sidewalk encroachments shall be located between the walking path and buildings.
Dining and/or display areas within the walking path shall not encroach into a
main walking path area (a 5 foot area closest to the amenity zone). A maximum
width of eight and one-half feet (81/2') may be allocated toward dining and
display on pedestrian streets, and a maximum width of seven feet (7') may be
allocated toward dining and display on vehicular streets. Examples of features
that may be utilized in dining and display areas are outdoor dining chairs and
tables, planters, ramps, stairs, A-frame signs and perimeter outdoor dining
fencing that is no greater than thirty six inches (36") in height and at least
seventy five percent (75%) opaque.
      4.   Provided According To Street Type: Sidewalks, walking paths, and
dining and/or display areas shall be provided in accordance with the
descriptions associated with each street type below:
         a.   Vehicular streets:

Theater, entertainment               5%   40%  100% 10%  50%  100%
 
      3.   Determining Total Requirements For Shared Parking Facilities: For
each applicable general land use category, calculate the number of spaces
required for each use, assuming it is the only use (refer to the schedule of
minimum off street parking requirements in section
13-12-3 of this title). Use that figure for each land use to calculate the
number of spaces required for each time period for each use (6 time periods per
use). For each time period, add the number of spaces required for all
applicable land uses to obtain a grand total for each of the six (6) time
periods. Select the time period with the highest total parking requirement and
use that total as the shared parking requirement.
   J.   Bicycle Parking Requirements: All new developments within the city
center zone shall meet the bicycle parking and bicycle lane requirements as
listed in section
13-6G-10 of this title.

13-5I-12: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES:
   A.   Nonconforming Structures: Nonconforming structures in the city center
zone may not be expanded in floor area beyond that which is necessary for
structural alterations for remodeling and facade enhancements. The legal
nonconforming status of structures in the city center zone will be lost, and
the structure shall be required to come into conformance with this article, if
there is any exterior alteration or enlargement of a structure where costs are
in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the structure's current assessed value at
the time of initial application for such alteration or enlargement work is
submitted. Notwithstanding this provision, all other nonconforming aspects of a
structure located within a city center zone shall comply with section
13-9-3 of this title.
   B.   Nonconforming Uses:
      1.   Change Of Use: A nonconforming use in the city center subdistricts
shall not be changed to a different use unless the proposed new use is a
conforming use under provisions of this article.
      2.   Abandonment Of Use: Once a nonconforming use in the city center zone
has been abandoned all nonconforming rights shall cease and the use within the
premises shall be in conformance with the provisions of this article.
      3.   Other Nonconforming Aspects: All other nonconforming aspects of a
use not covered in this section shall comply with section
13-9-2 of this title. (2001 Code § 89-3-1013)
13-5I-13: DEVELOPMENT PLAN, LAND USE ELEMENT AND ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW:
   A.   Development Plan: A development plan is to be prepared for each
proposed development (or phase) within the three (3) city center subdistricts.
The development plan shall provide pertinent information relative to public
improvements, development standards and compliance therein, design criteria,
and public incentives. The development plan shall consist of the following:
      1.   Uses And Infrastructure: Existing land uses, property ownership,
development character and the relative character of existing and proposed uses
and infrastructure. Potential impacts to existing infrastructure shall be
included in the analysis.
      2.   Master Plan: A master plan shall be provided for each of the three
(3) subdistricts. The master plan shall be graphically illustrated indicating
the proposed areas of development, phasing lines (if any) and the expected
times of development. The master plan shall meet the intent of this section,
the overall intent of the transit station overlay district in chapter 6,
article G of this title, the adopted West Jordan "Parks, Recreation, Trails And
Open Space Handbook", the West Jordan downtown revitalization design guidelines
and the West Jordan downtown revitalization land use element as prepared by LMN
Architects. The master plan shall be updated as is necessary based on proposed
changes within each development area. The zoning administrator shall determine
when these master plan updates are necessary.
      3.   Market Analysis: For sites larger than two (2) acres, an independent
real estate market analysis of the proposed development shall be prepared,
which takes into consideration the potential demand for the proposed
residential and nonresidential uses within the proposed development area.
      4.   Submittal Requirements: The applicant shall follow the submittal
requirements as outlined in subsections
13-5J-10B through E of this chapter, including, but not limited to, the
development's project boundary, building placement, right of way layout,
parking areas, pedestrian and bicycle paths, open space and general gathering
areas, building elevations of all proposed structures, and statements as to how
all building and development guidelines of the West Jordan downtown
revitalization design guidelines are being met.
      5.   Development Plan Review: The steps outlined in section
15-3-8 of this code shall be followed in connection with an application for
approval of a development plan, along with the required fees and other specific
processes required by this code to complete a specific project.
   B.   Land Use Element And Design Guidelines:
      1.   Because several essential compliance elements come into play with
regard to development within the city center zone, it can be difficult at times
to determine which part of each section of the zoning code or adopted design
guideline may be applicable. The intent of this section is to establish
requirements for a "downtown" zoning district which complies not only with the
standards and requirements of the transit station overlay district, chapter 6,
article G of this title, but also the adopted West Jordan "Parks, Recreation,
Trails And Open Space Handbook", the West Jordan downtown revitalization design
guidelines and West Jordan downtown revitalization land use element as prepared
by LMN Architects.
      2.   These five (5) zoning elements shall work together as a single
entity; wherein this title shall be used as a legal guide to determine
standards and requirements; while the West Jordan downtown revitalization
design guidelines, the West Jordan downtown revitalization land use element,
and the West Jordan "Parks, Recreation, Trails And Open Space Handbook" shall
be used for reference purposes to determine what can and cannot be accomplished
within the city center zone. Where there is a discrepancy in interpretation of
this article and the design and land use elements, the more restrictive
language shall apply.
   C.   Architectural Review: All proposed development within the city center
zone shall be reviewed by the design review committee. This committee shall
have the right to evaluate the physical layout, architectural characteristics
and amenities and may require changes or modifications in design to create
compatibility and conformity in the variety of uses and structures within the
development to ensure, protect and promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the citizens of the city. (2001 Code § 89-3-1014; amd. 2009 Code;
Ord. 10-09, 2-24-2010; Ord. 13-17, 4-24-2013; Ord. 14-19, 5-28-2014)

13-5J-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purposes of the west side planning area and the west side zoning districts
are to:
   A.   Implement the goals and objectives of the city general plan by managing
development through focused and site specific planning.
   B.   Accomplish the purposes of the city's general plan and provide for a
classification of residential and mixed use zoning districts to regulate land
development through the implementation of those zoning districts consistent
with adopted future land use designations.
   C.   Adopt a residential density incentive program that encourages the
installation of community amenities, the preservation of open space and trail
corridors, and the support of other physical, social and/or cultural
activities.
   D.   Enhance the appearance of the city by promoting outstanding urban
design while protecting the value of residential properties and buildings.
   E.   Promote safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation in
residential and mixed use neighborhoods and minimize conflicts between
pedestrians and vehicles.
   F.   Provide for planned and orderly use of land that promotes creative
development that also offers a range of housing styles, sizes and prices. (2001
Code § 89-3-1101; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 13-11, 3-27-2013)
13-5J-2: ESTABLISHMENT:
   A.   WSPA Defined: The WSPA is described as an area approximately four
hundred eighteen (418) acres in area, located between 5600 West and 6700 West,
7800 South and 8200 South.
   B.   Future Land Use Map: The future land use map is to be utilized as a
reference for designating specific land use types and residential densities as
described in the general plan and map.
   C.   WSPA Zoning Districts: The standards and other requirements of this
article apply only within the WSPA. (2001 Code § 89-3-1102; amd. 2009 Code;
Ord. 13-11, 3-27-2013; Ord. 15-02, 1-28-2015; Ord. 15-12, 6-10-2015)
13-5J-3: WEST SIDE SPECIFIC PLANNING AREA ZONING DISTRICTS:
The five (5) WSPA zoning districts are:
   A.   VLSFR (Very Low Density, Single-Family Residential) Zone: The very low
density, single-family residential zone is established to promote large single-
family residential lots, on land that is situated away from higher intensity
commercial and industrial developments and arterial and major collector rights
of way. This zone is characterized by larger open space areas, additional
landscaping and increased setbacks.
   B.   LSFR (Low Density, Single-Family Residential) Zone: The low density,
single- family residential zone is established to promote a quality living
environment, but more concentrated than the VLSFR zoning district. The intent
of this zoning district is to provide for increased service efficiency of
conventional single-family residential neighborhoods on land that is closer to
cultural, commercial, office and/or industrial corridors or nodes.
   C.   MFR (Medium Density, Multi-Family Residential) Zone: The medium
density, multi-family residential zone is established to promote medium density
residential development where residential structures can be attached or
detached single- family, two-family, townhome or multi-family in nature. This
zone is intended to allow for the development of neighborhoods as a
transitional buffer between commercial/industrial nodes or corridors from those
uses that are lower in intensity. It is also the intent of this zone to allow
for walkable multi-family developments that are located close to busier traffic
corridors. This zone shall promote the placement of residential structures in a
more compact or clustered type manner, with increased open space as a buffer.
   D.   HFR (High Density, Multi-Family Residential) Zone: The high density,
multi-family residential zone is established to promote an attractive setting
for high density, multi-story and multi-family structures developed in a
compact manner with large areas dedicated for open space. This zone is intended
to be applied to areas that are adjacent to higher intensity uses such as
commercial nodes and major roadways. The objective of this zone is to allow for
structures with higher residential densities, located in areas convenient to
shopping and employment centers, which serve economic and social demands not
adequately served in lower density zones. This HFR zone shall encourage
attractive, walkable multi-family developments that provide for large amounts
of open space and promote multimodal design elements.
   E.   MU (Mixed Use) Zone: The mixed use zone is established to promote urban
neighborhoods that contain small scale retail, service, and office uses with
supportive high density residential. This zone is intended to have a village
character design that facilitates the creation of walkable urban neighborhoods
adjacent to commercial nodes that are multimodal accessible. (2001 Code § 89-3-
1104; amd. 2009 Code)
13-5J-4: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Scope:
      1.   Uses allowed in the WSPA are listed in the following tables. Those
uses identified with a (P) are "permitted" and allowed by right. Those uses
identified with a (C) are "conditional" and require approval by the planning
commission. Those uses identified with an (AC) are "administrative conditional
uses" and may be approved by the zoning administrator. All uses are subject to
all other applicable provisions of this code. Uses not specifically listed are
not allowed in the WSPA.
      2.   Due to the commercial component of the MU zone, a separate land use
chart has been created to differentiate the district from the four (4) zones
that are entirely residential in nature.

13-5J-5: PERMITTED DENSITY AND INCENTIVE BONUSES:
   A.   West Side Planning Area Land Use Density:
      1.   Density shall be calculated in accordance with the land use density
chart below. The number of dwelling units allowed in a proposed development is
to be determined by multiplying the base density number of a development by its
net developable acreage.
WEST SIDE SPECIFIC PLANNING AREA LAND USE DENSITY CHART
 
Zone  Base Density DU Per Acre Maximum Density DU Per Acre
VLSFR 1.00                     2.00

MU    n/a                      25.00
 
      2.   This chart shall be used to determine the base and potential maximum
density of a development. If a developer elects to install specific approved
amenities within the defined boundary of a development, that development then
becomes eligible for increased density. Bonus density awarding shall be
determined and secured as outlined in section
13-5J-10 of this article.
      3.   Amendments to the approved development plan shall follow the
procedures set forth in section
13-5J-10 of this article.
   B.   WSPA Required Improvement And Density Incentives: A project is eligible
for increased density in each of the residential zoning districts of the WSPA
by complying with acceptable performance criteria as listed in subsection C of
this section.

The criteria listed above are further elaborated in section
13-5J-6 of this article.
   D.   Required Development Improvements: In accordance with the WSPA
standards and incentive chart, the criteria listed as "required" are mandatory
improvements and shall be interpreted as the minimum standard for all
residential developments in the WSPA. Exceptions, waivers and density bonuses
for these "required" improvements shall not apply.
   E.   Optional Development Improvements Or Amenities: The criteria listed in
the WSPA standards and incentive chart as "optional" may be selected at the
discretion of the developer as a means of both improving an overall development
and qualifying for incremental density bonuses. The weighted percentage points
are applied to the base density where the total allowed percentage number is
multiplied by the base density to achieve a higher overall density. Though the
total accrual of percentage points may exceed one hundred percent (100%), in no
case can density exceed the maximum dwelling units per acre for the
development's underlying zoning district.
   F.   Substitute Improvements And Amenities: The "optional" improvements/
amenities listed in WSPA standards and incentive chart are not exclusive. There
may be design and improvement amenities not listed in the chart that meet the
intent of this section. A developer may propose substitute improvements in the
preliminary development plan which may be approved by the city council. If
approved, the city council shall assign a weighted value to the substitute
improvement. The weighted value awarded shall be based on the optional
improvement in the chart that bears the closest resemblance to the substitute
improvement. (Example: A developer dedicates land to the city for a school site
in exchange for a density bonus award.) A gated community will not count as an
improvement/amenity for the purposes of density bonuses within the WSPA,
although included optional improvements/amenities within the gated community
may qualify.
   G.   Net Developable Acreage Calculation In The WSPA: The net developable
acreage of a development shall be determined by excluding the following:
      1.   Sensitive hillside land with a slope gradient greater than thirty
percent (30%).
      2.   Land that is to be dedicated for right of way purposes on the future
land use map, designated as an arterial, collector or highway (freeway) and
that is greater than sixty six feet (66') in width. Any portion of land in a
right of way which is in excess of sixty six feet (66') in width may be
reimbursed by the city upon request by a developer, but may not be calculated
for density purposes. Rights of way that are less than sixty six feet (66') in
width may be included in the calculation of density. (The optional landscape
buffer as described in section
13-5J-6 of this article may be included for purpose of calculating density.)
      3.   Any land that is determined to be within a primary drainage corridor
(creek/wash) or wetland area.
The city council may consider land that is to be dedicated for public purposes
either for reimbursement or as an area of land eligible for the purposes of
calculating density.
   H.   Determination And Calculation Of Density: When the developer agrees to
install certain improvements and amenities in a proposed development as
detailed in the required submittal of a development plan, the density of a
development may be increased through the following method:
      1.   First determine the base density from the chart in subsection A of
this section.
      2.   Then multiply the base density number by the weighted percentage
value expected for installed improvements.
      3.   Lastly, add the multiplied value referenced in subsection H2 of this
section by the base density number in the zoning district to which the project
is located. This will be the new density subject for approval.
(Example: A development's zone is LSFR with a base density of 2.01. Since the
developer selects to install an entryway monument worth 10 percentage points,
the base density can be increased by 10 percent; so (2.01 x .10 = .201); (2.01
+ .201 = 2.21). The new base density is now 2.21 du per acre.)
For determining density, all calculations shall be rounded to the nearest
hundredth.
   I.   Granting Of Density In WSPA: Final density shall be determined by the
city council at the time of master development plan or preliminary subarea
development plan approval. Density in the WSPA is directly tied to the weighted
percentage values expected for installed improvements as listed in the WSPA
standards and incentive chart. Dwelling unit density shall never exceed the
maximum for the development's applicable zoning district regardless of the
amount of density bonus awards granted. (Example: Maximum allowable density for
the MFR zoning district is 9.00 dwelling units per acre per the density chart
in subsection A of this section.) (2001 Code § 89-3-1106; amd. 2009 Code; Ord.
13-11, 3-27-2013; Ord. 16-21, 5-11-2016)
13-5J-6: NARRATIVE OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENT AND DENSITY INCENTIVE CHART:
The following information is intended to clarify the intent and meaning of the
criteria listed in the required improvement and density incentive chart, while
also listing the allotment of percentage points for each of the criteria. The
criteria listed below are listed in the same order as those found in the WSPA
standards and incentive chart:
   A.   Trails And Open Space:
      1.   Dedication Of Open Space, Trail (Drainage) Corridors Or "In Lieu
Fees", And Installation Of Trails In Accordance With The Comprehensive General
Plan And The City's "Parks, Recreation, Trails And Open Space Handbook":
         a.   Open Space Criterion Explanation: As a required criterion, all
residential developments shall provide open space at an amount equal to at
least twenty percent (20%) of the net area of land within the boundaries of the
master planned project. The method in which open space is dedicated and
maintained shall be determined at the time of review and approval of the
preliminary subarea development plan.
For interpreting this article, net open space shall be determined in the same
manner as defined in section
13-5J-5 of this article.
            (1)   Location Of Open Space: The location of open space shall be
consistent with the city's "Parks, Recreation, Trails And Open Space Handbook".
Required open space areas shall be as contiguous as feasibly possible and not a
collection of remnants or small pocket parks. Open space areas shall be
centrally placed among the lots or units.
            (2)   Acceptance And Dedication Of Open Space: Depending on the
location and type of development, the city shall accept open space through any
of the following methods:
               (A)   Cash In Lieu Of Dedication: The city may consider cash
payment in lieu of land dedication based on the need for dedicated open space
within a development's boundaries versus outside its boundaries. Consideration
of cash payments in lieu of land dedication shall be determined early in the
development process. Consideration of cash payments in lieu of land dedication
shall be determined early in the development process and will be on a case by
case basis.
The value of cash in lieu of land dedication shall be based on a current
appraisal of the estimated value of the unimproved land. Such payment shall be
used toward future park or open space acquisition and development by the city.
               (B)   Acceptance Of Open Space In Common Areas: Common area open
spaces within a project shall not be accepted by the city council until such
time that the development is processed and approved as a planned development,
condominium project, or as a multi-family development. Such common areas shall
be declared as "common open space" on the subdivision or condo plat, or on the
final site plan of a multi-family complex. Included with this declaration, a
homeowners' organization shall be formed for maintenance purposes, and a
declaration of covenants shall be recorded with the county recorder's office
which states the rules and regulations for the maintenance and upkeep of the
open space areas.
               (C)   Outright Dedication Of Land Within Boundaries Of
Subdivision Or Development: In some locations in the WSPA, it may be necessary
to designate and set aside property for future park purposes within the
development's boundaries. Because of this, a developer may be required to
dedicate twenty percent (20%) of the net developable land located within the
project area directly to the city. The determination of the installation of
reimbursement costs, if any, for any improvements shall be made by the city
council through review and approval of a required development agreement.
               (D)   Special Assessment Area: Establishment of a special
assessment area (or other improvement district) designating a unique charge
(levy) against properties in a specific geographical area that benefit from a
certain open space area may be considered by the city.
            (3)   Open Space Exclusions:
               (A)   Land that cannot be included in the twenty percent (20%)
open space calculation is considered the same as those areas that cannot be
included toward overall density calculations listed in section
13-5J-5 of this article.
               (B)   The inclusion of aboveground stormwater facilities
(detention or retention basins) for open space calculation is not permitted
unless the facility is determined by the city to be functional as an "active"
open space amenity area. Open space design and location generally shall be kept
separate and independent of drainage design and location.
               (C)   Yard areas within lots and park strips shall not be
counted toward meeting the minimum open space calculations or requirements.
         b.   Clay Hollow Wash And No Name (High School) Wash Multiuse/
Maintenance Trail:
            (1)   Primary Corridors: All primary trail (drainage) corridors
shall adhere with the standards and guidelines of the city's "Parks,
Recreation, Trails And Open Space Handbook", including required dedication
widths, trail standards, fencing/wall requirements, and landscape requirements.
            (2)   Alternative Corridors: Alternative trail corridors and
dedication widths may be approved by the city council in approval of the
preliminary development plan.
      2.   Installation Of Enhanced Open Space/Recreational Amenities And/Or
Landscaping/Irrigation In Excess Of That Required Per City Standards:
Criterion explanation: A developer may elect to install open space and
recreational amenities/facilities from the tables below, to obtain density
bonus awards up to a maximum of twenty two (22) points. Open space and
recreational amenities/facilities may be installed in common open space areas
within the boundaries of a development or provided within dedicated park or
open space land outside the boundaries of the subdivision. Percentage points
(or partial points) shall be awarded based on the type and size of amenity
being provided. The tables below shall be used to determine the value of each
installed amenity within a development:
 
Active Open Space Amenity/Facility  Value (Percent)
   Community garden                                               Up to 2

Note: The 2 tables above describe a total of 28 possible points, but a
developer is limited to selecting amenities totaling a maximum of 22 points.
Open space maintenance responsibilities shall be determined by the city council
in their review and approval of a development agreement. If an active or
passive open space area is privately owned, the area shall be declared as such
on the subdivision or condominium plat, or on the final site plan of a multi-
family complex development. A homeowners' association shall be formed to
maintain the open space, and a declaration of covenants shall be recorded with
the county recorder's office stating the rules and regulations for the
maintenance and funding of the open space areas.
The city may accept open space amenities/facilities within city dedicated trail
(drainage) corridors, master planned parks or other open spaces. The city may
also accept facilities for service purposes such as restrooms and drinking
fountains, which shall be designed to minimize the overall maintenance and
operation costs.
The active and passive amenity tables listed herein are not all inclusive.
There may be open space amenities not listed in the chart that meet the intent
of this subsection. A developer may propose substitute amenities in the
development plan, and if approved, the city council shall award bonus points to
the substituted amenity. The bonus points awarded shall be based on the amenity
in the chart that bears the closest resemblance to the substitute amenity.
The installation of open space amenities shall be completed upon acceptance of
other required public improvements in the development. If the development has
no public improvements, the open space/recreational amenity shall be completed
upon issuance of fifty percent (50%) of the building permits within the
development. The completion of an open space amenity shall be completed upon
issuance of one hundred percent (100%) of the building permits on a given
development site or phase containing the amenity. All off and on site
amenities/facilities shall be explained in detail within the development plan
and/or development agreement. All amenities/facilities being proposed for the
purpose of obtaining density bonus awards shall be bonded in the amount that is
equal to the improvement's value.
      3.   Improvement Of Trail Corridors And Installation Of Trail Amenities
In Excess Of That Required Per City Standards:
Criterion explanation: As an optional density bonus incentive worth a maximum
of fifteen (15) percentage points, a developer may install amenities to enhance
dedicated trail corridors. Qualifying amenities shall meet minimum installation
requirements. Items in subsections A3a through A3d of this section provide
information as to those amenities that are acceptable for density bonus
awarding, also indicating the minimum number of amenities that must be
installed, and at what interval along a trail corridor is acceptable placement
for such amenities.
         a.   Installation of landscaping/vegetation and irrigation within
dedicated trail corridors. Acceptable landscaping includes the installation of
one tree every twenty five (25) linear feet of trail, and one shrub, bush or
perennial flower every two (2) linear feet of trail (grouping or clustering is
permissible and encouraged). All installed trees and shrubs shall be water
conserving species that can withstand dry conditions once established. The
plant list within the city of West Jordan recommended plant list is designated
by the city as the primary reference for determining qualifying plants.
Acceptable irrigation systems shall meet the irrigation standards outlined in
section
13-13-6 of this title (up to 4 percentage points).
         b.   Installation of one bench every one thousand feet (1,000') (up to
1 percentage point).
         c.   Installation of one trash receptacle every one thousand feet
(1,000') (up to 1 percentage point).
         d.   Installation of a split rail or wrought iron fence that is four
(4) to six feet (6') in height, and located at the side of the dedication area
(up to 4 percentage points). The city council may accept an alternative fence/
wall upon review and approval of the preliminary development plan.
      4.   Dedication Of Additional Property For Trails Beyond That Required
Per City Standards Along Creeks/Washes:
Criterion explanation: As an optional development improvement worth up to a
maximum of fifteen (15) percentage points, a developer may improve and dedicate
additional property along both sides of a creek/wash for the enhancement of a
trail corridor in accordance with the comprehensive general plan and the city's
"Parks, Recreation, Trails And Open Space Handbook". To be eligible for a
density bonus, a minimum of ten feet (10') and a maximum of twenty five feet
(25') of additional land may be dedicated beyond the required width of the
dedication area. Points shall be awarded depending upon the total length and
amount of additional property being dedicated (i.e., 1 percentage point for
each foot of additional land being dedicated).
   B.   Street Design:
      1.   Pedestrian Scale And Consistent, Architectural Street Lighting:
         Criterion explanation: As a required development improvement,
consistent street lighting shall be installed that is pedestrian scaled,
architecturally detailed, and enjoyable from the pedestrian's perspective. The
description of the style of pole and fixture, its location throughout the
development, and maintenance responsibilities shall be explained in detail in
the development plan. For consistency purposes, the following minimum standards
apply:
         a.   All streetlight poles (inclusive of an ornamental concrete or
metal integrated base), located on local streets and within multi-family
projects shall be no taller than fifteen feet (15') in height measured from
grade to top of the pole (excluding the light fixture).
         b.   All streetlights located on local streets and within multi-family
projects shall be located within the park strip or along walking paths. The
placement of streetlights may be staggered or opposite location patterns with
the maximum spacing between each light being no less than seventy five feet
(75') and no greater than one hundred fifty feet (150').
         c.   Uplight limiting shields shall be required on all lights to
minimize uplighting, glare and light pollution.
         d.   Concrete, vinyl or fiberglass poles are prohibited.
         e.   The color, type and style of pole and fixture shall be reviewed
and approved by the city council at the time of approval of the preliminary
development plan.
      2.   Traffic Calming:
         Criterion explanation: As a required development improvement, traffic
calming devices shall be required on all new public or private residential
streets. The number and type of traffic calming devices installed shall be
determined by: a) the size of the development; b) the number of intersections;
c) the intensity of traffic flow expected based on a required traffic study;
and/or d) as determined as being necessary by the traffic engineer for safety
purposes.
         a.   Intersection Traffic Calming: At a minimum, one of the following
types of traffic calming devices shall be installed at each "T" and four-way
intersection:
            (1)   Bulb outs;
            (2)   Roundabout or traffic circle;
            (3)   Raised intersection or raised patterned walkways;
            (4)   Forced turn islands or "pork chop" islands.
         b.   General Traffic Calming: At a minimum, one of the following types
of traffic calming devices shall be installed on local streets that have a
linear length between a four-way or "T" intersection in excess of four hundred
feet (400'):
            (1)   Raised speed hump or speed table;
            (2)   Choker;
            (3)   Chicane;
            (4)   Lateral shift;
            (5)   Landscaped entryway medians (gateway);
            (6)   Raised crosswalk.
         The development plan shall indicate the number, type and placement of
the proposed traffic calming devices in a new residential development. The
development plan shall also provide a detail of each type of traffic calming
device to be utilized in the development, also indicating maintenance
responsibility.
      3.   Street Design:
         Criterion explanation: As a required development improvement streets
shall be designed to promote ease of navigation, safety, walkability and
continuity.
         All new streets in the WSPA shall be designed to be connective
allowing a development to link together as a seamless network.
         No more than fifteen percent (15%) of all lots in a single development
shall be located on a cul-de-sac or dead ending street. This percentage is
calculated by adding the total length of local street rights of way in the
proposed development. For the purpose of this article, a cul-de-sac shall be
measured from the curb line of the intersecting street to the farthest point of
the tangent of the cul-de-sac.
      4.   Entryway Monuments Or Gateway Feature To Subdivision/Development:
         Criterion explanation: As an optional development improvement worth up
to ten (10) percentage points, entryway monuments or ornamental gateway
features are encouraged on all new residential and mixed use developments at
each point of entry of a subdivision or development from an arterial or right
of way. The style, material, height, size and placement of all monuments or
gateway features shall be approved by the city council in their review of the
preliminary development plan. In general, one percentage point shall be granted
for each monument constructed per entry into a subdivision, and up to two (2)
percentage points shall be granted for each ornamental gateway feature into a
project.
      5.   Provision Of Landscape Buffer On Major Rights Of Way:
         Criterion explanation: To eliminate double fronting lots and long
incongruent walls, and as an optional development improvement worth up to
twenty two (22) percentage points, a developer may orient the frontage of a
development toward an arterial or collector right of way; provided that the
lots fronting the arterial or collector are accessed from an internal
neighborhood street, separated by a minimum thirty two foot (32') landscaped
berm or buffer.
         If used, this landscape buffer should be bermed to a height not to
exceed four feet (4') at the apex, and not exceed a four to one (4:1) slope on
either side of the apex. All landscaping installed within this landscape buffer
shall be in accordance with section
13-13-10 of this title. Upon approval by the city's engineering department, the
landscape buffer may act as an on site detention pond for a development rather
than a berm.
         Additional density bonuses are available based upon the total amount
of linear frontage of the buffer installed along a collector or arterial right
of way. Maintenance responsibilities shall be determined by the city council in
approval of a project's development agreement.
         As an alternative to installing a thirty two foot (32') landscaped
berm or buffer, and as optional development improvement worth (up to) ten (10)
percentage points, a developer may install a minimum eight foot (8') landscape
buffer between a subdivision wall and back of sidewalk along an arterial or
collector right of way.
         The total area included in the landscape buffer may be included toward
open space calculations if the area is not to be dedicated to the city (i.e., a
condominium or a planned development, where maintenance of the buffer is under
private control and not the city's responsibility). Percentage points shall be
awarded based on the total amount of linear frontage along an arterial or
collector right of way being dedicated for buffering purposes. When installing
a thirty two foot (32') landscape buffer, one percentage point shall be granted
for every one hundred feet (100') of linear frontage for a maximum of twenty
two (22) percentage points. If an eight foot (8') landscape buffer is to be
installed between a subdivision wall and the sidewalk, one percentage point
shall be granted for every one hundred feet (100') of linear frontage for a
maximum of ten (10) percentage points.
   C.   Smart Growth:
      1.   Master Planned Subdivision Design:
         a.   As a required development improvement, all new residential
developments shall be required to be master planned through review and approval
of a conceptual and preliminary and final development plan, except in instances
where a development meets the following criteria:
            (1)   The development has a total land area of less than two (2)
acres in size;
            (2)   The development will contain ten (10) or fewer residential
lots;
            (3)   The development is already within the boundaries of a
standard zoning district (i.e., R-1-10).
         b.   All development within the WSPA shall comply with the lot and
bulk criteria listed in section
13-5J-7 of this article.
      2.   Pedestrian Friendly And Walkable Neighborhood Design:
         Criterion explanation: All developments shall be required to meet the
design criteria as listed below as a means to improve overall neighborhood
design, ensure compatibility between developments and increase safety:
         a.   Sidewalks:
            (1)   Sidewalks shall: a) be constructed and maintained along both
sides of a city dedicated or private right of way; b) link with trail systems
or paths to provide a continuous pedestrian network throughout the WSPA; c) be
a minimum of five feet (5') wide; and d) be constructed in accordance with the
"Public Improvement Standards, Specifications And Plans Manual" based on the
type of street being installed.
         b.   Park Strips:
            (1)   Park strips shall be: a) installed and maintained along both
sides of a city dedicated or private right of way; b) used as a landscaped
buffer between vehicular rights of way and pedestrian sidewalks; c) a minimum
of fifteen feet (15') in width when installing a meandering sidewalk; and d)
constructed in accordance with the "Public Improvement Standards,
Specifications And Plans Manual" based on the type of street being installed.
            (2)   Park strip landscaping shall be installed in accordance with
section
13-13-8 of this title, unless an alternative is approved by the city council
with recommendation from the city engineer. All park strip landscaping shall be
installed by the developer prior to the certificate of occupancy of a
residential dwelling. During the winter seasons when it may be difficult to
install landscaping, a cash bond or other approved financial instrument shall
be made with the city according to section
13-1-9 of this title (private projects) or section
8-3C-2 of this code (public improvements).
         c.   Pedestrian Crossing Treatment At All Street Corners And
Intersections: Corners and intersections that are required to be installed for
public dedication or private right of way purposes shall be required to have
safe pedestrian crossings. The following pedestrian crossing treatment types
are acceptable:
            (1)   Reduce vehicle pavement widths at intersections by providing
"bulb outs" at the street corners.
            (2)   Provide pavers or colored/dyed stamped concrete at crosswalk
locations (corner or midblock crosswalks). Alternative materials may be
accepted by the city council at the time of approval of the preliminary or
amended development plan. Painted or taped crosswalks are not acceptable.
            (3)   Install raised intersections with a grade difference of no
more than three inches (3") and a lip with a grade no greater than twenty
percent (20%).
            (4)   Install street edge treatments within "bulb outs", such as

            (5)   Install adequate nighttime lighting.
         d.   Pedestrian Access To Trailheads: Pedestrian access to trailheads
are required only on sites adjacent to trails that are to be dedicated to the
city, where at least one point of public access shall be provided that links a
public or private sidewalk to a dedicated city trail.
      3.   Alternative Load Garage Configuration:
         Criteria explanation: As an optional development improvement worth a
maximum of eighteen (18) percentage points, a developer may choose to provide a
variety of garage placements that minimizes vehicular influence in a
neighborhood and parking aprons on the streetscape.
         a.   Single- And Two-Family Residential, Attached Townhome Garages: To
be eligible for a density bonus award, no more than twenty five percent (25%)
of the lots in an overall development (phased or otherwise) shall have
standard, front loading or front yard/side loading garages. (See garage
placement figures 1 and 2 of this section.)

         b.   Multi-Family Residential Garages: The following is required of
multi-family residential structures for density bonus purposes:
            (1)   Garage units/carports shall not be located adjacent and/or
parallel to street frontages.
            (2)   Garages configured as multi-family townhomes (row houses)
shall be rear loaded.
            (3)   Where only front loaded garages are possible, they shall be
subordinate to the residential structure and recessed at least one foot (1')
from the main portion of the residence.
         c.   Multi-Family Residential Garage Options: To meet the intent of
this article, the planning commission may award density bonus percentage points
for the application of creative garage configurations, such as:
            (1)   Inclusion of tandem parking.
            (2)   Garage below residence townhome configurations.
            (3)   Multiple side entry garages accessed from a single driveway.
            (4)   Alley accessed and alley loaded garages.
         The city council shall determine the number of percentage points to be
awarded based on the design and configuration of garages as displayed within
the preliminary development plan. For single- and two-family residential
developments, nine (9) percentage points shall be awarded if no more than fifty
percent (50%) of the lots in the development have standard front load, front
side load or semirecessed load garages. The maximum eighteen (18) percentage
points will be awarded for single- and two-family residential developments
where seventy five percent (75%) of the lots in the development have garages
that are: rear yard, attached/detached front load; rear yard, side load; or
alley load. The city council may also consider reducing the percentage of lots
and allotting percentage points where it is found that superior design, energy
efficiency, or the constraints meant to be applied to traditional architecture
impede the intent of this section (i.e., energy efficient home with a standard
or front load garage).
      4.   Clustered Subdivision Design:
         Criterion explanation: The intent of this criterion is to allow for
cluster subdivision design over conventional subdivision design. By compacting
development, open space areas, sensitive lands and steep slope hillsides may be
preserved, and costs associated with public improvements may be decreased.
Cluster subdividing allows a developer to group all potential lots into a
compact cluster of smaller lots, with the remaining land area designated as
open space. As an optional development improvement worth ten (10) percentage
points, a developer may choose to implement a clustered subdivision design.
         a.   Requirements For Open Space Preservation: The minimum lot sizes
throughout the development shall be determined by the city council during their
review and approval of the preliminary development plan. Proposed developments
with lots less than five thousand (5,000) square feet in size shall be a
planned residential development (PRD). Cluster subdividing is not applicable in
the mixed use (MU) zoning district.
         b.   Conveyance: The ownership of the preserved open space may be held
by either:
            (1)   Conveying or dedicating the land to the city, where the city
is willing to accept the land.
            (2)   Control of the land by a homeowners' association.
   D.   Building Design:
      1.   Attractive, Theme Based And Consistent Architectural Features On All
Structures:
         Criterion explanation: All new developments shall have a comprehensive
architectural theme that places high emphasis on building design and form.
Great attention shall be given with regard to building materials, window
placement and proportion, roof design, garage placement, color and variety.
         a.   Single- And Two-Family Residential Or Attached Townhomes:
            (1)   Product Variety: Though the development as a whole shall be
consistent in theme, all new developments shall provide a variety of home
styles. To ensure diversity, identical building elevations shall not be
permitted on the same street frontage or directly across the street for a
distance of at least four hundred feet (400').
            (2)   Residential Corner Homes: Additional attention shall be paid
to homes on corner lots. Since corner lots face two (2) streets, homes on
corner lots shall be specifically designed to include wraparound and consistent
architecture to these visible sides. Corner homes shall continue the ornamental
features and material accents of the front facade, such as extending the porch
and/or utilizing the same size windows and features as the front facade.
            (3)   Garages:
               (A)   The home rather than the garage shall be the primary
emphasis of the front and facade of a residential dwelling.
               (B)   The following shall be required of all garages in the
single-family residential zoning districts:
                  (i)   For two (2) car garages that are front loading and face
the street, the homes shall be designed so that garage door or doors comprise
no more than fifty percent (50%) of the width of the front elevation.
                  (ii)   Garages built to accommodate three (3) or more
vehicles in nontandem configuration shall not occupy more than fifty five
percent (55%) of the total width of the front elevation. All three (3) car
garages shall have a minimum offset of no less than two feet (2') between the
main garage door(s) and the additional third garage door.
            (4)   Entrances: The main entrance of all single- and two-family
residential structures shall have a clear entryway extending from the public
sidewalk to the front door, where the main entrance shall be oriented to the
street to promote an active street. Architecturally enhanced, covered porches
shall be installed on at least fifty percent (50%) of the structures within a
proposed development per this section.
            (5)   Rooflines And Roof Eaves:
               (A)   Rooflines: Multiple or modulated rooflines shall be used
on all residential structures. Structures with flat or low pitched rooflines
shall have parapet walls with decorative detail and/or horizontal modulation.
Where a roof is pitched, the slope of the pitch shall be no less than four to
twelve (4:12) unless approved otherwise by the city council.
               (B)   Roof Eaves: Unless otherwise approved by the city council
when it is found that a building meets or exceeds architectural design
standards or where energy efficient design inhibits roof overhangs, all
residential structures shall be designed with at least a sixteen inch (16")
roof overhang on all elevations with second or multiple elevations designed
with decorative brackets, beams or exposed rafters.
         b.   Multi-Family Structures: All multi-family buildings shall be
designed to respect adjacent properties and the privacy of the residents by
situating outdoor activity areas strategically throughout the project area.
Common recreational areas shall be larger and fewer rather than smaller and
more dispersed.
            (1)   Building Form And Character:
               (A)   Buildings shall be designed with a balance of vertical and
horizontal directional emphasis, not a primarily horizontal directional
emphasis.
               (B)   Front and rear building facades shall be articulated or
the architectural mass broken into the appearance of multiple buildings to
provide visual variety. Facades shall be modulated and flat wall surfaces shall
be broken through modulation, fenestration or entrances at least every ten feet
(10') on every building face.
               (C)   Multi-family structures greater than one story shall
clearly delineate the boundary between each floor of the structure through belt
courses, cornice lines, or similar architectural detailing.
            (2)   Architecture: The architectural features, materials and
articulation of multi-family structures shall be continuous along all sides of
the structure. From the following list, a minimum of five (5) architectural
features shall be included on a multi-family structure:
               Balcony (at least 4 feet deep by 6 feet wide).
               Corner trim extending from the base to the roofline.
               Cornices.
               Decorative balcony railings.
               Dormers (minimum of 1 dormer per dwelling unit per complex).
               Entry columns or pillars.
               Modulated roof or parapet detailing.
               Mullion windows.
               Planter boxes or pot shelves.
               Window trim.
      2.   Installation Of Covered Porches Throughout Fifty Percent Of
Development:
         Criterion explanation: As an optional development improvement worth up
to fourteen (14) percentage points, all new single- and two-family residential
developments in the WSPA should install front yard porches throughout fifty
percent (50%) of the development.
         a.   Single- And Two-Family Structures:
            (1)   Porches shall be at least fifty (50) square feet in area.
            (2)   Dwellings located on a corner lot shall be designed to have a
porch that wraps around the side of the home.
            (3)   All porches shall be covered and enhanced with decorative
railings and porch columns.
            (4)   In lieu of covered porches, rooftop patios or balconies may
be approved for partial or full percentage point allotment through review and
approval of the preliminary subarea development plan.
         b.   Multi-Family Structures: Entrances to multi-family structures
shall provide at least one of the following elements:
            (1)   Canopy (extending at least 4 feet from the building face).
            (2)   Portico (extending at least 4 feet from the building face).
            (3)   Recessed entry.
         To meet this criterion, multi-family structures shall be designed with
entrances that provide a visually distinct architectural expression.
      3.   Enhanced Door, Window, Eave And Roofing Treatment:
         Criteria explanation: As an optional development improvement worth up
to twelve (12) percentage points, all residential developments should be
designed with enhanced door and window treatment and effort should be made to
select door and window types that present a pleasing facade arrangement to the
public. No partial percentage points will be allotted for the installation of
any single item listed herein.
         a.   Window Placement: Windows should be installed on all facades of a
residential structure and shall be proportionate in size to the wall face in
which the window is located. Residential building design should avoid long,
monotonous, uninterrupted and windowless walls. The maximum unbroken distance
between any corner of the structure and a window and/or windows on any side of
a residential structure is eight feet (8').
         b.   Window Treatment: All windows should have framed in wood, brick,
stone or stucco trim that is at least four inches (4") in width. Windows set in
vinyl or stucco without any trim is not permitted. Planter boxes, pot shelves
and/or shutters are encouraged. Shutters, when installed, shall be
proportionate in size to the window they abut.
         c.   Window Style: Identifiable window mullion patterns should be
installed on at least seventy five percent (75%) of the windows to meet this
criterion.
         d.   Window Types: Encouraged window types include:
            (1)   Bay or bow windows;
            (2)   Oval, octagon or wrapping corner windows;
            (3)   Arched windows;
            (4)   Clustered windows.
         e.   Door Treatment: All front doors should be complemented with at
least one sidelight, transom window or double door.
      4.   Equal Dispersion And Use Of High Quality Building Materials:
         Criterion explanation: As an optional development improvement worth up
to twelve (12) percentage points, all residential developments should be
designed with high quality building materials throughout the development. All
sides of a structure should be designed consistently and with quality in mind.
No partial percentage points will be awarded for single material enhancements.
         a.   Primary Materials: Primary materials for all single- and two-
family residential structures should incorporate a variety of durable exterior
materials and finishes, such as brick, stone veneers, cement stucco or EIFS
stucco, cement board siding (hardiplank/hardiboard), or wood shingles. The use
of materials such as vinyl or aluminum siding is prohibited.
            A structure's design features shall not be restricted to a single
facade. No one material may dominate any single side of a residential structure
unless specifically included in the development plan approved by the city
council. The installation of high quality building materials on the front
facade of the home alone while downgrading the building materials of the sides
and rear is prohibited for density bonus purposes.
            When installing a brick wainscot, the height of the wainscot shall
be at least three feet (3') in height for single-, two-family and townhome
structures, and at least four feet (4') in height for multi-family structures
as measured from the top of the foundation and extended (wrapped) around all
sides of the structure.
         b.   Accent/Trim Materials: Accent and trim materials for all single-
and two- family residential structures should include real or cultured masonry
materials (such as stone, brick or cement stucco) or treated wood. (2001 Code §
89-3-1107; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011; Ord. 13-11, 3-27-2013; Ord.
16-21, 5-11-2016)
13-5J-7:   RESIDENTIAL LOT AND BULK STANDARDS:
Residential developments shall be designed with lots that have reduced minimum
lot sizes. However, the overall project area shall still meet the density
standards of the applicable zoning district. The planning for lots and the
location of dwellings on those lots shall be achieved in a harmonious and
functional manner. The building envelope of all lots in a specific development
shall be determined during the review and approval of the development plan
(preliminary and final). A developer shall place emphasis on the design and
form of the envisioned neighborhood instead of inflexible setback, lot width
and lot size requirements. The intent of this section is to allow for greater
flexibility in subdivision and site design while assuring that the character of
the applicable zoning district remains intact.
   A.   Lot Sizes: For developments with lots all greater than five thousand
(5,000) square feet in size, there is no minimum lot size requirement in terms
of area, width or depth for single-, two-family residential and townhomes.
However, a lot must be large enough in area to meet the minimum setback
requirements of the zone, determined primarily by dwelling type and garage
placement. For developments with lots less than five thousand (5,000) square
feet in size, the development shall be a planned residential development (PRD),
subject to this article and section
13-5C-1 of this chapter. Individual sites for multi-family developments shall
be a minimum of four (4) acres in size.
The minimum lot area for all single-family corner lots shall be a minimum of
one thousand (1,000) square feet greater than the average lot size of all
interior lots (noncorner lots) for the project or phase being reviewed for
approval.
   B.   Building Coverage: No more than seventy five percent (75%) of a single-
and two-family residential or attached townhome lot shall be covered by a
principal and accessory structure in the WSPA. The overall building coverage of
a multi- family structure on a site shall be determined through review and
approval of a development plan. It is the responsibility of the developer to
provide enough information within the development plan illustrating how each
proposed home type can adequately fit on any given lot.
   C.   Height: All residential structures shall be designed to maintain the
scale of the entire neighborhood with respect to height, where no one structure
shall be overpowering in height or size when compared with other structures in
the same development. For single- and two-family residential or attached
townhome structures, the overall maximum height shall be thirty feet (30'). For
multi- family structures, the maximum height of a structure shall be
established by the city council.
   D.   Residential Structure Setback Standards:

   E.   Multi-Family Residential Setback Standards:
      1.   Multi-family dwelling developments shall be set back at least twenty
feet (20') from a dedicated or private street, and a minimum of thirty five
feet (35') when abutting an arterial or collector street.
      2.   Multi-family dwelling developments abutting a single-, two-family or
attached townhome development shall be set back a minimum of thirty feet (30')
from the abutting subdivision or development's property line.
      3.   Specific lot, height and bulk standards in multi-family developments
shall be established by the city council through approval of the preliminary
development plan. (2001 Code § 89-3-1108; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 13-11, 3-27-
2013; Ord. 16-21, 5-11-2016)
13-5J-8:   GENERAL RESIDENTIAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Parking And Loading: Unless otherwise stated in this article for
incentive purposes, residential developments shall comply with the provisions
governing off street parking in chapter 12 of this title.
   B.   Landscaping: Unless otherwise stated in this article for incentive
purposes, residential developments shall comply with the provisions governing
landscaping in chapter 13 of this title.
   C.   Signs: Unless otherwise stated in this article for incentive purposes,
residential developments shall comply with the provisions governing signs in
title 12 of this code.
   D.   Location Of Boats, Trailers, Campers, Recreational Vehicles And Motor
Homes: The keeping and storing of boats, trailers, campers, recreational
vehicles and motor homes in the WSPA shall comply with the provisions governing
such recreational vehicles in section
7-3-8 of this code. Common recreational vehicle parking areas in residential
subdivisions are encouraged.
   E.   Fences And Walls:
      1.   Approval Required: All fences and walls shall be approved by the
city council through approval of the preliminary development plan. A detailed
fence/wall plan showing the site placement and details of each type of fence/
wall to be installed shall be clearly defined in the plan.
      2.   Specific Fence And Wall Requirements:
         a.   All fences and walls shall be compatible and consistent in height
and material throughout an entire subdivision, village, and/or master planned
development.
         b.   A permanent fence or wall shall be required along the boundaries
of a development where existing or future adjacent land uses are found to be a
potential hazard or are of a different intensity (i.e., residential abutting
manufacturing). Increased landscaping and buffering may be considered as an
alternative to fencing and walling where different uses act as a common or
unified development.
         c.   For all single- and two-family residential developments, a
perimeter wall shall be located directly adjacent to arterial or collector
streets (streetscape wall). Maintenance of these areas shall be declared in the
development plan and approved by the city council.
         d.   Notwithstanding the wall and fence requirements of this section
and as approved otherwise in the development plan, all other fencing and
screening requirements of chapter 14 of this title are applicable in the WSPA.
   F.   Accessory Structures: Accessory structures include garages, sheds, or
any other subordinate structure that is clearly intended to serve the
residential nature of the primary structure on the same lot. Accessory
structures shall only be placed in conformance with section
13-8-3 of this title, unless otherwise approved as part of a development plan
by the city council, with the following exceptions:
      1.   Barns, silos, and other agriculturally related accessory structures
not used for human occupancy are not subject to any height or size restrictions
if located on a minimum one acre parcel in the VLSFR zoning district. However,
all minimum setback requirements shall be satisfied for any such accessory
structure per section
13-8-3 of this title.
      2.   Accessory structures not exempt under subsection F1 of this section
shall not exceed the height of the principal building, and shall be at least
twenty five percent (25%) smaller in floor area than the permitted residential
structure or structures on the same lot. (2001 Code § 89-3-1109; amd. 2009
Code; Ord. 13-11, 3-27-2013; Ord. 14-09, 5-14-2014; Ord. 16-21, 5-11-2016)
13-5J-9: MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The mixed use zoning districts are established to create comprehensively
planned, multiuse centers located outside central business districts and
transit station development areas. It is also the intent of this district to
provide a more flexible approach to the comprehensive design and development of
multiuse centers than the procedures and regulations applicable under the
various conventional zoning categories and planned residential development
zones.
   A.   Mixed Use Framework:
      1.   The location and type of all mixed uses shall be shown on the
development plan and submitted in accordance with this section.
      2.   Residential uses shall be included in any mixed use development and
shall be an integral component of the development. Housing shall be achieved
through a mixture of multi-family dwelling units and townhouses/condominiums.
Multi-family dwelling units may be constructed as multiuse structures where the
dwelling units are located above the first floor level. Multi-family dwelling
units may be constructed as a separate residential site, provided they are
located adjacent to the commercial/retail or service buildings and uses.
      3.   The phasing of residential and nonresidential uses shall be
determined by the city council.
   B.   Mixed Use Density: The maximum number of dwelling units per acre in a
mixed use development is twenty five (25) dwelling units per acre.
   C.   Street Types: Unless otherwise approved in the preliminary development

13-5J-10: DEVELOPMENT PLAN PROCESS:
   A.   Development Plan Review: The steps outlined in this section and section
15-3-8 of this Code shall be followed in connection with an application for
approval of a development plan, along with the required fees and other specific
processes required by this Code to complete a specific project.
   B.   Development Plan Submittal Requirements:
      1.   Preapplication Conference: A preapplication conference shall be held
with the City staff in order for the applicant/developer to become acquainted
with the development plan process and submittal requirements. City staff will
give feedback on the proposed project based on the information that is
presented as a result of the proposed project. To be scheduled for a
preapplication conference, the applicant/developer shall submit a concept site
plan of the proposed development, submitted in accordance with the concept site
plan checklist as provided by the development services department.
      2.   Master Development Plan: Following the initial preapplication
conference and review of the conceptual master development plan, a master
development plan shall be prepared and submitted. The intent of the master
development plan is to illustrate the area(s) within a specific geographic
boundary which are intended to be a part of a single, cohesive large
development. In general, the master development plan is intended to act as a
project's guiding document for all future development (consisting of
subdevelopments) where more detailed planning will follow with submittal and
approval of subarea plans. The Planning Commission shall forward a
recommendation to the City Council regarding the master development plan, where
in turn, the plan shall then be approved, conditionally approved, or denied by
the City Council. Upon approval, the master development plan shall be the sole
guiding document for all subsequent development within the defined master plan
area.
      3.   Preliminary Subarea Development Plan: Following review and approval
of the master development plan, the applicant/developer shall submit a subarea
development plan, accompanied by all required application information.
   It is during the subarea plan review process that bonus density may be
awarded. Bonus density awarding and vesting can occur through the following
methods:
         a.   Bonus Density Awarding:
            (1)   A subarea development plan shall be submitted either
following or concurrent with the master development plan. The master
development plan must accompany a separate preliminary subarea development
plan. The preliminary subarea development plan will provide the framework and
detailed information for each specific area (phase) within the project. The
density bonus shall be awarded as part of the approval of the preliminary
subarea development plan.
            (2)   To achieve bonus density awarding, the master development
plan and/or the preliminary subarea development plan shall include the
following information:
               (A)   Preliminary Subarea Development Plan Report: The
preliminary subarea development plan shall cover the overall objective and
direction of the proposed project ready for both density bonus awarding and
approval. The plan shall go into full detail of the intent of the project and
shall give the City a clear idea of the resulting product. The report shall
include the following information:
                  (i)   Scope: An introduction to the development, which
explains the land use and zoning characteristics, the overall project area, the
number of proposed dwelling units, the number of phases, and the inclusion of
mixed use areas, parks, schools, trails and special amenities.
                  (ii)   Location: Location explanation, explaining the overall
location of the project (where each phase is located in comparison to the
approved master plan), and the location of differing proposed land uses.
                  (iii)   Land Features: Description of the existing physical
features of the land, such as the location of drainage canals, irrigation
canals, floodplains, steep slopes, existing infrastructure, grade, ditches,
easements, etc.

full detail (also using visual references if possible), concerning the intent
to install development improvements and amenities. For those developments
seeking density bonuses, improvements and amenities shall be in accordance with
section
13-5C-8 of this chapter and section
13-5J-6 of this article. This portion of the report shall not only list those
improvements and amenities to be installed for density bonus purposes, but
explanation shall also be given as to how the required development improvements
and amenities will be met and to what extent. This portion of the report shall
explain which development improvements and amenities are being selected for
density bonus purposes by the developer; wherein, it is essential that the
report explain what effort will be made to meet each specific criterion. Since
percentage points will be given for density bonus purposes based on the type of
improvement and amenity being installed in a development, the report shall
explain:
                     (a)   Exactly how the criterion is being met.
                     (b)   The purpose of the improvement or amenity.
                     (c)   How the improvement or amenity serves the
development and justifies an increase in density.
                     (d)   What is being installed to meet the criterion
(giving the number, type and/or placement of each type of improvement or
amenity feature, i.e., how many traffic calming devices).
                  (v)   Zoning Regulations: Explain how the City zoning
regulations apply to the proposed development, detailing that either: standard
zoning setbacks based on the type of structure will be met; or that setbacks
will be determined in review of the development and approved by the City

13-6A-3: Official Airport Overlay Map
13-6A-4: Permitted And Conditional Uses
13-6A-5: Development Standards
13-6A-1: PURPOSE:
The airport overlay zones are established to provide areas around Salt Lake
City Municipal 2 Airport which, in the interest of the public health, safety
and general welfare of the city, promote and preserve the function and utility
of airport and aircraft activities in appropriate areas. (2001 Code § 89-4-101)
13-6A-2: ESTABLISHMENT OF AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONES:
Airport overlay zones are restrictive designations applied in addition to any
other zone in this title. The airport overlay zones are defined and established
as follows:
   A.   Clear Zone (Acl): A zone that commences at the end of and is equal to
the width of the primary surface. Where the primary surface of the runway is
two hundred fifty feet (250') wide, the clear zone shall expand outward
uniformly to a width of four hundred fifty feet (450') at a horizontal distance
of one thousand feet (1,000') from the primary surface, its centerline being
the continuation of the centerline of the runway. Where the primary surface is
five hundred feet (500') wide, the clear zone shall expand uniformly to a width
of eight hundred feet (800') at a horizontal distance of one thousand feet
(1,000') from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the
centerline of the runway.
   B.   Approach Zone (Aa): A zone with inner edge coinciding with and being
the same dimensions as the outer clear zone boundary. Where
the outer edge of the clear zone is four hundred fifty feet (450'), the
approach zone shall expand outward uniformly to a width of one thousand five
hundred feet (1,500') from the primary surface, its centerline being a
continuation of the centerline of the runway. Where the outer edge of the clear
zone is eight hundred feet (800'), the approach zone shall expand outward
uniformly to a width of two thousand feet (2,000') at a horizontal distance of
five thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface, its centerline being a
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   C.   Noise Zone (An): A zone determined by the exterior boundary of the
projected airport activity noise level of sixty five (65) dB.
   D.   Horizontal Zone (Ah): A zone, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of a five thousand foot (5,000') radius from a point on the
centerline and two hundred feet (200') beyond the end of each runway and
connecting and adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
   E.   Conical Zone (Ac): A zone that commences at the periphery of the
horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four
thousand feet (4,000').
   F.   Designation: The airport overlay zones shall be designated on the
zoning map by affixing the suffixes Acl, Aa, An, Ah or Ac in parentheses after
the applicable zone designation, e.g., P-F (Ac).
   G.   Overlay Zones Supersede: The regulations of the airport overlay zone
shall supersede the regulations of the zones to which they are attached. (2001
Code § 89-4-102; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6A-3: OFFICIAL AIRPORT OVERLAY MAP:
   A.   Lands to Which the Zones Apply: The airport overlay zones shall be
applied to all land within the airport overlay zone designated on the zoning
map, as periodically amended.
   B.   Establishment of Official Airport Overlay Map: The official airport
overlay map, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this title. The official airport overlay
map is based on the airport area of influence as established by Salt Lake City
Corporation, owner of the Salt Lake City Municipal 2 Airport, in conjunction
with the federal aviation administration, and shall be on file in the offices
of the city recorder and the development services department.
   C.   Rules for Interpretation of Airport Overlay Boundaries: Boundaries of
airport overlay zones shall be determined by scaling distances on the official
airport
overlay map. Where interpretation is needed as to exact location of airport
overlay zone boundaries, the zoning administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation, subject to appeal to the board of adjustment as provided in
this title.
   D.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This article does not imply that
areas outside the airport overlay boundaries or land uses permitted within the
overlay zones will be free from noise or hazards related to airport activities.
Therefore, this article shall not create liability on the part of the city or
its officers or employees for any damages that result from reliance on this
article, or any administrative decision made under this article. (2001 Code §
89-4-103; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on
January 6, 2020)

13-6A-5: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Special Use Provision In Acl And Aa Overlay Zones: No activities or
uses shall be permitted in Acl and Aa overlay zones which will:
      1.   Direct a steady light or flashing light of white, red, green or
amber color toward an aircraft engaged in a takeoff or toward an aircraft
engaged in a straight final approach toward a landing at an airport other than
an FAA approved navigational signal light or visual approach slope indicator
(VASI).
      2.   Cause sunlight to be reflected toward an aircraft engaged in an
initial straight climb following takeoff or toward an aircraft engaged in a
straight final approach toward a landing at an airport.
      3.   Generate smoke which could attract large concentrations of birds or
which may otherwise affect safe navigation within this area.
      4.   Generate electrical interference that may be detrimental to the
operation of an aircraft and/or airport instrumentation.
   B.   Acoustical Treatment In An Overlay Zone: Building design and
construction for all hotel/motel uses in the An overlay zone shall provide for
appropriate acoustical treatment to reduce noise to an acceptable level. All
hotel and motel developments proposed within the An overlay zone shall submit
with the project site plan construction techniques for reducing noise levels
within the dwelling units to sixty five (65) decibels or less, for approval by
the building official.
   C.   Height Restrictions: No tree or structural intrusion shall be permitted
within the airspace created by an upward sloping plane of one foot (1')
vertical for each foot horizontal:
      1.   Beginning at the end of the primary surface and continuing along the
extended runway centerline, a horizontal distance of one thousand feet (1,000')
in the Acl overlay zone and five thousand feet (5,000') in the Aa overlay zone.
      2.   In the Ah overlay zone, beginning at an elevation above the airport

ARTICLE B.  REDWOOD ROAD OVERLAY ZONE
SECTION:
13-6B-1: Purpose
13-6B-2: Establishment Of Redwood Road Overlay Zone
13-6B-3: Permitted And Conditional Uses
13-6B-4: Development Limitations And Standards
13-6B-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   As one of the oldest major arterial streets in the city, historical
development along Redwood Road has resulted in a wide range of land uses and
zoning designations. Since it was fully improved in 1996, Redwood Road's
increased size and high traffic volume have resulted in an increased impact on
properties fronting the street, especially those which have not been included
within more recently approved site development or subdivisions.
   B.   Because it is in the city's interest to allow for the reasonable
development of properties along Redwood Road when such uses conform with the
general plan, the Redwood Road overlay zone is intended to increase development
options for certain properties which front on Redwood Road. However, the
overlay zone is only to be used where it can be shown that the increase in the
intensity of use over that of the underlying zone is minimal, and that the use
will not cause undue impacts on neighboring properties and residents or the
traffic flow of Redwood Road. These issues shall be addressed during the
conditional use permit review process. It is also intended that the Redwood
Road overlay zone will preserve existing buildings and prevent Redwood Road
from being inundated with commercial strip centers. (2001 Code § 89-4-301; amd.
2009 Code)
13-6B-2: ESTABLISHMENT OF REDWOOD ROAD OVERLAY ZONE:
The Redwood Road overlay (RWO) zone applies to properties which have frontage
on Redwood Road and which are not part of a residential subdivision or multi-
family complex. Properties which do not front on Redwood Road may be included
if: a) the property has a direct association with a property fronting on
Redwood Road; and b) no portion of a main building allowed because of the
overlay zone will be located more than three hundred feet (300') from Redwood
Road. (2001 Code § 89-4-302; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6B-3: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Permitted: Those uses listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning
district.
   B.   Conditional: All conditional uses require approval by the planning
commission. All uses are subject to all other applicable provisions of this
title and title 15 of this code. Uses shall include those listed as conditional
uses in the underlying zoning district and the following uses:
      Antiques (includes furniture, glassware, etc.).
      Apparel and accessories.
      Bakeries and doughnut shops.
      Beauty and barber services.
      Bicycles.
      Books, stationery, art and hobby supplies.
      Cameras and photographic supplies.

      Gifts, novelties, etc.
      Grocery stores, convenience (not supermarkets).
      Hardware.
      Insurance agents.
      Jewelry.
      Meats and fish.
      Optical goods.
      Paper products.
      Pet sales and supplies.
      Photography services.
      Pressing, alteration and garment repair.
      Professional services, office only, except hospitals, sanatoriums, rest
homes.

      Radios, television and musical instruments.
      Real estate services.
      Retail trade item food.
      Sewing machines and parts.
      Shoe repair, hat cleaning.
      Toys.
      Vacuum cleaners, parts and supplies.
      Variety stores, limited price (not department stores).
      Watch, clock, jewelry repair, engraving. (2001 Code § 89-4-303; amd. 2009

13-6C-5: DESIGNATION CRITERIA:
   A.   Designation Of Historic Areas And Districts: An area, neighborhood or
district may be designated as a historic area or historic district, if it has
significant character, interest or value as part of the development, heritage
or cultural characteristics of the city, the state or the United States, and if
it meets one or more of the following categories:
      1.   Historical Significance:
         a.   It is the location of a significant event in the history of the
city, the state or the United States;
         b.   It is associated in a significant way with the life of a person
important in the history of the city, the state or the United States; or
         c.   It is associated in a significant way with an important aspect of
the cultural, political or economic heritage of a community, the city, the
state or the United States.
      2.   Architectural Significance:
         a.   It embodies the distinctive visible characteristics of an
architectural style, period or a method of construction;
         b.   It is an outstanding work of a designer or builder;
         c.   It contains elements of extraordinary or unusual architectural or
structural design, details, use of materials or craftsmanship; or
         d.   It portrays the environment of a group of people in an era of
history characterized by a distinctive architectural style.
      3.   Historic Area Significance: Because of its prominent location,
contrasts of siting, age or scale, it is an easily identifiable visual feature
of the city and contributed to the distinctive quality or identity of the city.
   B.   Designation To Historic Sites List:
      1.   Any building, structure, object or site may be designated to the
city historic sites list, if it meets all the following criteria:
         a.   It is located within the official boundaries of the city;
         b.   It is at least fifty (50) years old;
         c.   It has retained its historic integrity, in that there are no
major alterations or additions that have obscured or destroyed the significant
historic features. Major alterations that would destroy historic integrity
include, but are not limited to, changes in pitch of the main roof, enlargement
or enclosure of windows on the principal facades, additions of upper stories or
the removal of original upper stories, covering the exterior walls with
nonhistoric materials, moving the resource from its original location to one
that is dissimilar to the original, additions which significantly detract from
or obscure the original form and appearance of a structure when viewed from the
public way.
      2.   Alternately, if the property, building, site or object does not meet
the integrity requirements outlined in subsection B1c of this section, it may
still qualify for designation, if it meets one of the following requirements
for exceptional significance:
         a.   It is directly associated with events of historic significance in
the community;
         b.   It is closely associated with the lives of persons who were of
historic importance to the community; or
         c.   It exhibits significant methods of construction or materials that
were used within the historic period; and
         d.   It has been documented, in accordance with the June 1993 Utah
state historic preservation office standards for intensive level surveys, or
subsequent revisions, and copies of the documentation have been placed in the
local and state historic preservation files.
   C.   Designation To Historic Landmark Register: Any district, building,
structure, object or site may be designated to the historic landmark register,
if it meets the following criteria:
      1.   Location: It is located within the official boundaries of the city;
and
      2.   National Register Listing; Alternate Criteria: It is currently
listed in the National Register of Historic Places and a copy of the approved
national register form has been placed in the historic preservation
commission's local historic preservation files. Alternately, if a property not
yet listed in the national register has retained its historic integrity, and
meets at least one of the following national register criteria:
         a.   It is associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or
         b.   It is associated with the lives of persons significant in our
past; or
         c.   It embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or
method of construction, represents the work of a master, or possesses high
artistic values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity, whose
components may lack individual distinction; or
         d.   It has yielded or may be likely to yield, information important
in prehistory or history such as archeological sites; or all documentation has
been done in accordance with the Utah state historic preservation office
standards for intensive level surveys, using the June 1993 version, or
subsequent revisions, or national register standards, and a copy of that
documentation has been placed in the historic preservation commission's local
historic preservation files.
      3.   Owner Approval:
         a.   Individual Properties: Each owner of the property must approve
the action to designate the property to the historic landmark register by
submitting its written consent to the historic preservation commission.
         b.   Historic Districts: A majority of the property owners in a
proposed historic district must be in favor of the designation or at least not
opposed to it. Written objections from over fifty percent (50%) of the property
owners will constitute lack of approval and will halt the designation process.
(2001 Code § 89-4-403; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6C-6: RESULTS OF HISTORIC DESIGNATION:
   A.   Land Use Consideration: Properties designated to the historic landmark
register may receive special consideration to encourage their preservation.
   B.   Building Code: In the event of rehabilitation of the property, local
building officials will consider waiving certain code requirements in
accordance with the international building code, or any successor provision,
which deals with historic buildings.
   C.   Financial Aid: Owners of historic landmarks may seek assistance from
the historic preservation commission in applying for grants or tax credits for
rehabilitating their properties.
   D.   Review Exterior Work: Proposed exterior work on historic landmarks is
subject to the review and approval of the historic preservation commission. The
purpose of this review is to advance the preservation of historic properties.
This review applies to individually designated landmark properties or any
property, contributing or noncontributing, located in the landmark designated
historic area or district and applies only to exterior work that requires a
building permit, sign permit or demolition permit. In order to facilitate this
review:
      1.   Applications for building, demolition or sign permits pertaining to
historic areas, districts, sites or buildings shall be forwarded to the
building inspection division of the development services department, prior to
their issuance.
      2.   A building permit applicant shall file a request for a certificate
of historic appropriateness with the historic preservation commission on a form
furnished by the historic preservation commission.
      3.   At its next scheduled meeting, the historic preservation commission
shall review the application and proposed work for compliance with the
development standards and design guidelines of this article. Applicants whose
proposed projects comply with the provisions of this article shall be issued a
"certificate of historic appropriateness" within ten (10) days, which
authorizes the issuance of the appropriate permit. Applicants whose proposed
projects are found to be in noncompliance with this article shall be offered a
negotiating period of sixty (60) days, during which time the historic
preservation commission and applicant shall explore all options for an
acceptable solution. These may include the feasibility of modifying the plans,
using the historic landmark for alternative purposes, and reselling the
property to another party. The historic preservation commission may extend the
negotiating period an additional sixty (60) days for the purposes described
above, if deemed necessary to accommodate a potential solution. If no solution
has been agreed upon at the conclusion of either applicable negotiating period,
the certificate of historic appropriateness will be denied and the city
building official shall not issue any building permit.
   E.   Certificate Issued Because of Economic Hardship:
      1.   The historic preservation commission shall approve a certificate of
appropriateness for a landmark property, if the owner has presented substantial
evidence demonstrating that unreasonably economic hardship will result from
denial of the certificate of appropriateness.
      2.   In order to sustain a claim of unreasonable economic hardship, the
historic preservation commission may require the owner to provide information
demonstrating that the property is capable of producing a reasonable economic
return for the owner. However, a demonstration of economic hardship by the
owner shall not be based on conditions resulting from wilful or negligent acts
by the owner, purchasing the property for substantially more than market value
at the time of purchase, failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs,
failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal
tenant improvements. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12
noon on January 6, 2020)
13-6C-7: HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
   A.   Applicability: The development standards and design guidelines in this
article shall apply to the following instances:
      1.   Rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction of, or addition to,
the exterior of any improvement which constitutes all or part of a historic
area, historic district, landmark site or building.
      2.   Demolition or relocation of any improvement which is all or part of
a building within a historic area, historic district, landmark site or
building.
      3.   New construction within a historic area or district, upon any
landmark site or on property associated with a landmark site or building.
      4.   Any signs placed on any building within a historic area or district,
upon any landmark site, or on property associated with any landmark building.
      5.   Any fence, wall or major landscaping elements within a historic area
or district, on a landmark site, or on a lot associated with a landmark
building.
   B.   Compliance With Guidelines: Compliance with the adopted guidelines by
any property owner shall be voluntary, except in cases where a contract of
compliance has been executed by the owner of a building or site within a
designated historic district, a landmark site or building. (2001 Code § 89-4-
405; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6C-8: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND DESIGN GUIDELINES:
The following standards and guidelines shall be used in determining the
historic appropriateness of any application pertaining to historic landmark
properties, including individually designated landmark properties and both
contributing and noncontributing properties in landmark designated historic
areas or districts:
   A.   Review: The historic preservation commission shall review each
application using the criteria in this section, as supplemented by the U.S.
secretary of the interior's 1990 standards for rehabilitation and guidelines
for rehabilitating historic buildings, or its amended or successor provisions.
If the historic preservation commission finds the application to be in
substantial compliance with these provisions, it shall timely issue a
certificate of appropriateness and immediately forward a copy to the
development services department or its designee and the applicant.
   B.   Standards and Guidelines:
      1.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building, its site and environment.
      2.   The historic character of a property shall be substantially retained
and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      3.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      4.   Most properties change over time and those changes which have an
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and
preserved.
      5.   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
      6.   Encourage and facilitate rehabilitation work, especially on the
exterior and the principal facade of historic structures to facilitate
preservation of existing historic features.
      7.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. It should
avoid "dressing up" buildings by adding features based on speculation regarding
historicity. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical or pictorial evidence.
      8.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      9.   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      10.   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction
should be subordinate to the original building and shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. New work shall be differentiated from
the old and, where practical, it should be lower in height, attached to the
rear, set back along the side, and subordinate in scale and architectural
detailing. New work shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and
architectural features of the old and undertaken in a method and manner that
protects the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
      11.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner, that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
      12.   Avoid demolition of landmark and contributing buildings because
they are a finite resource and cannot be replaced.
      13.   Provide that vacant buildings be weather and vandal proofed, in
order to minimize further deterioration and the threat to public safety.
      14.   Avoid moving buildings, especially to create artificial groupings
of historic buildings. If buildings must be moved, the new site should be
similar to the original site and the original setback and orientation of the
building on the lot should be replicated.
      15.   Provide that height, width, setback, roof shape, and the overall
scale and massing of new buildings, are compatible with surrounding historic
buildings and the overall streetscape.
      16.   Provide that materials on at least the primary facades should be
similar to original materials on facades of surrounding historic buildings.
These will usually be brick, stucco, stone or wood siding, depending on the
specific characteristics of the district.
      17.   Provide that architectural details, including wood or metal trim,
porches, cornices, arches, window and door features do not replicate historic
features on surrounding historic buildings.
      18.   Provide that window and door openings are similar in size and
orientation, vertical or horizontal, to openings on historic buildings and
should take up about the same percentage of the overall facade as those on
surrounding historic buildings.
      19.   Provide that the relationship of the width to the height of the
principal elevations are in scale with surrounding structures and streetscape.
Wider new buildings may be divided into segments that more closely resemble the
facade widths of historic buildings.
      20.   Provide that the roof shape of a building is visually compatible
with the surrounding structures and streetscape. Unusual roof shapes, pitches
or colors are discouraged. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective

13-6C-9: DEMOLITION OF DESIGNATED HISTORIC RESOURCES:
   A.   Delay: When any application is made for a demolition permit for a
structure within a historic area or district, or a building designated in the
city historical site list or the historical landmark register, the zoning
administrator may delay approval of the demolition for a period of up to thirty
(30) days, to:
      1.   Allow the historic preservation commission to consider and make
recommendations regarding the application;
      2.   Allow the historic preservation commission to make reasonable
efforts to document its physical appearance before demolition occurs.
Documentation shall include, at a minimum, exterior photographs, preferably
including black and white, and of all elevations of the historic building. When
possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the building will be made
to provide an accurate floor plan drawing of the building;
      3.   Review the condition of the structure to determine the impact of the
demolition to the neighborhood, and the technical feasibility of preserving the
structure;
      4.   Make the owner aware of economic incentives available to
rehabilitate historic resources; and
      5.   Encourage the property owner not to demolish the building until an
attempt can be made to locate either suitable tenants to make the building
economically viable again or to find a purchaser who is willing to acquire and
rehabilitate the structure.
   B.   Findings: Upon findings of fact by the historic preservation commission
that preserving the structure is warranted and in the best interest of the
city, the permit may be delayed for an additional thirty (30) days in order to
find funding or other means to compensate the applicant for purchase of the
structure or for its preservation.
   C.   Extension: A third thirty (30) day delay may be instituted by the city
council upon a finding from the historic preservation commission that
additional time is warranted. (2001 Code § 89-4-406; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6C-10: REMOVAL OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES:
Properties which, in the opinion of the historic preservation commission, after
review and consideration, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility, may be
removed from the historic sites list and the historic landmark register. (2009

Notes:
1.   Plans and reports outlined in section
13-6D-3 of this article are required for a development site with an average
slope greater than 10 percent.
2.   Minimum lot widths may be modified by the planning commission in the case
of a planned development or clustered subdivision if the modification results
in a more efficient and attractive use of the land.
3.   Land on a development site with a slope gradient greater than 30 percent
cannot be included for the purpose of calculating density.
   B.   Calculation Of Average Slope: Average slope of a development site shall
be determined by computer generated slope calculation programs using contour
data found through elevation surveys. Surface values for determining average
slope shall be determined at two foot (2') contour intervals.
      1.   Buildable Area: Building and accessory structures shall be located
only upon those areas constituting buildable land, which area shall be fully
contiguous and at least two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in size,
and shall have a minimum dimension, both width and length, of fifty feet (50').
      2.   Building Setbacks: Location of a building or accessory structure
shall be set back a minimum of ten feet (10') and an average of twenty feet
(20') from a contiguous hillside slope of thirty percent (30%) or greater.
   C.   Clustering Of Building Sites: Clustering of development is recommended
and may be required by the planning commission to achieve the objectives of
this article. Whether proposed by an applicant or required by the planning
commission, minimum lot size requirements may be reduced upon findings by the
planning commission that:
      1.   The clustering proposal meets all other applicable requirements of
this article and other applicable development standards;
      2.   The clustering proposal, compared with a more traditional site
development plan, provides better solutions for achieving the purposes of this
article by, among other things, providing more open space, preserving existing
trees and vegetation coverage, and preserving sensitive environmental areas,
such as stream corridors, slide areas, wetlands and steep slopes;
      3.   The clustering proposal will have no significant adverse impact on
adjacent properties or development, or, if such impacts would result, the
applicant has agreed to implement appropriate mitigation measures such as
landscaping, screening and other design solutions to buffer and protect
adjacent properties from the proposed clustered development; and
      4.   The architecture, height, building materials, building colors and
other design features of the development blend with the surrounding natural
landscape and are compatible with adjacent properties or development.
   D.   Prohibition Of Development On Slopes Greater Than Thirty Percent: No
development, including clearing, excavation and grading, shall be allowed on
slopes greater than thirty percent (30%). Slopes greater than thirty percent
(30%) shall be considered undevelopable area on the final site and building
plan.
   E.   Prohibition Of Development On Designated Ridgelines:
      1.   No development shall intrude into any ridgeline protection area that
has been identified and designated by the city during the development review
and approval process.
      2.   For the purposes of this article, designated ridgeline protection
areas shall consist of prominent ridgelines that are highly visible from public
rights of way or trails, and shall include the crest of any designated hill or
slope, plus the land located within one hundred feet (100') horizontally (map
distance) on either side of the crest.
   F.   Maximum Impervious Cover: The maximum impervious cover allowed on a
single residential lot in a standard subdivision shall be thirty five percent
(35%). For planned developments and cluster subdivisions, the planning
commission shall determine the maximum amount of impervious cover a development
may have based upon the review and recommendation of the city planning and
engineering departments.
   G.   Slope Of Usable Land: The slope of usable land shall not exceed thirty
percent (30%). Land greater than thirty percent (30%) shall be either:
      1.   Dedicated as permanent open land with an open land easement granted
to the city or another responsible legal entity; or
      2.   Included as part of an approved building lot containing the minimum
usable land required by this article with an open land easement granted to the
city.
   H.   Wildfire Hazards And Tree/Vegetation Removal: In areas determined by
the fire chief or designee to be highly susceptible to fire hazards, vegetation
up to thirty feet (30') from the perimeter of a structure shall be selectively
pruned, thinned and regularly maintained to help minimize the risk of property
damage from wildfire, and to provide space for firefighting equipment and
personnel. When landscaping within this thirty foot (30') fire break area, use
of fire resistant plants is strongly encouraged.
   I.   Streets And Access:
      1.   The street standards and specifications of the city shall apply to
all developments, except where conditions related to proper development of
hillside areas necessitate altering these standards as outlined herein.
      2.   Streets shall not cross slopes between thirty percent (30%) and
fifty percent (50%), unless specifically approved by the planning commission,
after receiving a favorable recommendation from the city engineer. Approval
shall be based on the following findings:
         a.   No alternate location for access is feasible or available;
         b.   No individual segment or increment of the street that will cross
slopes between thirty percent (30%) and fifty percent (50%) exceeds one hundred
feet (100') in length;
         c.   The cumulative length of individual segments or increments that
will cross slopes between thirty percent (30%) and fifty percent (50%) does not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the total length of the street; and
         d.   No significant adverse visual, environmental or safety impacts
will result from the crossing, either by virtue of the design and construction
of the street as originally proposed, or as a result of incorporation of
remedial improvements provided by the developer to mitigate such impacts.
      3.   Under no circumstances shall any street cross slopes greater than
fifty percent (50%).
      4.   Streets shall, to the maximum extent feasible, follow the natural
terrain.
      5.   Variations to street design standards developed to solve special
hillside visual and functional problems may be presented to the planning
commission and city council for consideration. Examples of such variations may
be the use of split roadways or one-way streets for short sections in steeply
sloped areas without intersections to avoid deep cuts or modifications of
surface drainage for curb, gutter and sidewalk design. Variations to street
design standards may be approved by the city council only after review of each
individual application and after receiving a recommendation from the planning
commission.
      6.   The developer shall dedicate to the city a slope easement for any
cut or fill slope created by construction of a street on sensitive hillsides
which is not contained within the public right of way.
      7.   Points of access shall be provided to all developed and undeveloped
land for emergency firefighting equipment.

Channels: Filling or dredging of major natural drainage channels, including
Barney's Wash, Barney's Creek, Bingham Creek, Clay Hollow Wash, Dry Wash and
others as designated in the stormwater master plan, is prohibited without the
approval of the city engineer.
      2.   Pedestrian Or Vehicular Crossings Of Drainage Corridors: Where
either pedestrian or vehicular access over a watercourse, gully, stream bed or
stormwater runoff channel is found to be necessary or desirable, a bridge or
other approved structure as approved by the city engineer shall be constructed.
Bridges or other structures crossing watercourses, gullies, stream beds or
stormwater runoff channels shall be designed to minimize impacts on these
natural drainage corridors.
      3.   Minimum Setbacks: All buildings, accessory structures, leach fields
and parking lots shall be set back at least one hundred feet (100') from the
top of bank of watercourses, gullies or stream beds.
      4.   Preservation Of Vegetation: All existing vegetation within drainage
corridors shall be preserved and, where necessary to provide adequate screening
or to repair damaged riparian areas, supplemented with additional native or
adapted planting.
   K.   Responsibility For Construction And Maintenance Of Improvements: The
developer or the owner, in the case of single-family and two-family dwellings,
shall be fully responsible for making all improvements in accordance with
approved plans. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining all
improvements made in accordance with the site development approval. (2001 Code
§ 89-4-504; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6D-5: BONDING REQUIREMENTS:
The developer or lot owner may be required to guarantee the completion of
revegetation projects, the stabilization of grading sites, construction of

13-6E-1: FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE OF ZONE:
   A.   Areas of special flood hazard in the city are subject to periodic
flooding that may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas
of special flood hazard that increase flood elevations and velocities.
Buildings and structures that are inadequately floodproofed, anchored,
elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the
flood loss.
   B.   It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by establishing provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure that persons who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   C.   To accomplish its purpose, this article includes methods and provisions
for:
      1.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      4.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development that
may increase flood damage; and
      5.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. (2001 Code § 89-4-601)
13-6E-2: ESTABLISHMENT:
The floodplain overlay zone (F-P) is a restrictive designation applied in
addition to any other zone in this title. The floodplain overlay zone shall
consist of the areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal
emergency management agency (FEMA) on current flood insurance rate maps (FIRM).
The floodplain overlay zone shall be designated on the zoning map by affixing
the suffix "F-P" in parentheses after any zone designation, e.g., R-1-10 (F-P).
The regulations of the floodplain overlay zone shall supersede the regulations
of the zones to which they are attached. (2001 Code § 89-4-602; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6E-3: APPLICABILITY:
This article applies to all developments within the city in the F-P zone. No
structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended or altered
without full compliance with this article and other applicable regulations.
This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this article and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. The provisions
of this article shall be considered minimum requirements, liberally construed
in favor of the city, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under state law. (2001 Code § 89-4-603; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6E-4: OFFICIAL FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY MAP:
   A.   Lands to Which the F-P Zone Applies: The F-P zone shall be applied to
all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the FIRM maps as being
located within the boundaries of an area of special flood hazard.
   B.   Adoption of Official Floodplain Overlay Maps: The FIRM maps and all
explanatory matter thereon, on file in the offices of the city recorder and the
development services department, and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted
by reference as the official floodplain overlay maps for the city and declared
to be a part of this article.
   C.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain Boundaries: Scaling distances on
the official floodplain map shall determine the boundaries of the floodplain.
When interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
floodplain (for example, where a conflict exists between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions) the zoning administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation, subject to appeal to the board of adjustment as provided in
this code. The board of adjustment shall use the floodplain information reports
as a guide in interpreting boundaries. (2001 Code § 89-4-604; amd. 2009 Code;
Ord. 10-07, 2-2-2010; Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January
6, 2020)
13-6E-5: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
evaluation. More extensive flooding may occur on rare occasions or flood
elevations may increase due to manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This article shall not be construed to
imply that land outside areas of special flood hazard or land uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article
shall not create liability on the part of the city or its officers or
employees, or FEMA, for any flood damage resulting from reliance on this
article or any administrative decision made under this article. (2001 Code §
89-4-605; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6E-6: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Administrator Appointed: The city engineer is hereby appointed to
administer this article by granting or denying development permit applications
in accordance with its provisions.
   B.   Duties: The duties of the floodplain administrator shall include, but
are not limited to, the following:
      1.   Review all development permits to determine if the floodplain
management requirements of this article have been satisfied;
      2.   Review all development permit applications to determine if all
necessary permits have been obtained from federal, state, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required;
      3.   Review all development permits to determine if proposed development
may adversely affect the flood carrying capacity of the areas of special flood
hazard. The term "adversely affect" means damage to adjacent property due to
increased flood elevation attributed to physical changes to the floodway and
adjacent over bank areas.
         a.   If there is no adverse effect and the development is not a
building, then the permit shall be granted without further consideration.
         b.   If there will be an adverse effect, technical justification for
the proposed development shall be required. The technical justification may be
the written opinion of a registered professional engineer stating that the
proposed development will not adversely affect adjacent properties.
         c.   If the proposed development is a building, this article shall
apply;
      4.   Obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data
available from a federal, state, or other source, if base flood elevation data
has not been provided;
      5.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures, whether or not the structure contains a basement;
      6.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
         a.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure has been floodproofed; and
         b.   Maintain floodproofing certifications required by this article;
      7.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this article;
      8.   Notify adjacent communities and the flood control division of the
county prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit
evidence of such notification to FEMA through the state NFIP coordinator;
      9.   Require that maintenance be provided within the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not
diminished;
      10.   Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact boundaries of
areas of special flood hazard;
      11.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within areas of
special flood hazard (SFHA) zone AE on the city's FIRM, unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any
point within the city; and
      12.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, the floodplain administrator may
approve certain development in SFHA zones AE and AH, on the city's FIRM which
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood at any point
within the city. (2001 Code § 89-4-606; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-07, 2-2-2010)
13-6E-7: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Permitted: Permitted uses in the F-P zone are the same as those
permitted in the zone with which it is combined.
   B.   Conditional: Those uses requiring the issuance of a conditional use
permit prior to their establishment shall be the same as those uses requiring
such permit in the provisions of the underlying zone with which the F-P zone
has been combined, including all uses involving the construction or erection of
permanent structures or placement of fill materials. To obtain a conditional
use permit within an F-P zone, the following standards shall be met:
      1.   The proposal satisfies the purpose of the F-P zone.
      2.   New construction or substantial improvements to existing structures
within a floodplain (including prefabricated and mobile homes) will:
         a.   Be protected against flood damage;
         b.   Be designed (or modified) and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure; and
         c.   Utilize construction methods and practices and materials that
will minimize flood damage.
      3.   The project will be provided with water supply systems and/or
sanitary sewage systems designed to minimize or eliminate:
         a.   Infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         b.   Discharge from the system into floodwater; and
         c.   The impairment or contamination of on site waste disposal systems
during flooding.
      4.   New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures
in the areas of special flood hazard will have the lowest floor (including
basements) elevated to or above the level of the 100-year flood, or, if
nonresidential, will be floodproofed to the standards set forth in this
article.
      5.   No structure, earth fill or other surface obstruction to water flow,
except bridges or flood control devices, will be closer than one hundred feet
(100') to the bank of the Jordan River, or within a designated water passage
area (regulatory floodway) within the established floodplain.
      6.   Any activity approved by virtue of a conditional use permit will not
permit any fill or encroachments within the designated floodway that would
impair its ability to carry and discharge water resulting from a 100-year
flood, except where the effect on flood heights is fully offset by stream
improvements.
      7.   The following relevant factors will be considered in reviewing each
application:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         c.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         d.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         e.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         f.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         h.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         i.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         j.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area. (2001 Code § 89-4-607; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-07, 2-2-2010)
13-6E-8: DEVELOPMENT PERMITS:
   A.   Permit Required: A development permit shall be obtained before
construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard.
   B.   Application: Application for a development permit shall be made on
forms furnished by the city and may include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions and elevations of the area in question;
      2.   Existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,
drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing;
      3.   Elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all structures;

that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure comply with the
floodproofing criteria in section
13-6E-9 of this article; and
      6.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. (2001 Code § 89-6-608; amd.
2009 Code)
13-6E-9: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using
methods, materials, and practices that minimize flood damage.
   A.   Areas of Special Flood Hazard: In all areas of special flood hazard
where base flood elevation data have been provided, the following standards
shall apply:
      1.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure, and placement of manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated above the base flood elevation.
      2.   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated above the base flood elevation; or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
         a.   Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight below the
base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the standards of this section are satisfied. Such certifications shall be
provided to the city administrator or designee.
   B.   Buildings Or Structures: Buildings or structures shall have a low flood
damage potential and if permitted shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of
floodwaters. So far as practicable, buildings or structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
Whenever possible, buildings or structures shall be constructed with
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow.
   C.   Structural Storage Facilities: Any structural storage facilities for
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, or other toxic
materials which could be hazardous to public health, safety and welfare shall
be located so as to ensure that the facilities are situated above the base
flood elevation or adequately floodproofed to prevent flotation of storage
containers or damage to storage containers which could result in the escape of
toxic materials into floodwater.
   D.   Flood Protection Standards: Commercial buildings and structures located
with any floor (including basement floor) at an elevation equal to or below the
regulatory flood level within a designated floodplain shall conform to the
following flood protection standards:
      1.   Buildings or structures shall be firmly anchored and mass or weight
shall be added to prevent flotation.
      2.   Service facilities such as heating and air conditioning equipment
shall be constructed at or above the base flood elevation or shall be
floodproofed.
      3.   Walls shall be reinforced to resist water pressures.
      4.   Paints, membranes or mortars shall be used to reduce seepage of
water through walls.
      5.   Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems shall be
designed to prevent the entrance of floodwaters.
      6.   Buildings and structures shall be constructed to resist rupture or
collapse caused by water pressure or floating debris.
      7.   Valves or controls shall be installed on sanitary sewer and storm
drains to permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and
stormwaters into buildings or structures. Gravity drainage in basements may be
eliminated by mechanical devices.
      8.   All electrical equipment, circuits and installed electrical
appliances shall be located and installed in a manner which will ensure that
they are not subject to flooding.
   E.   Anchoring: All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
   F.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes shall be installed using
methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, over the top and frame ties to ground anchors.
This requirement is in addition to applicable anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved in the R-M zone (residential, mobile home) shall be elevated and
adequately anchored on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation.
   G.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
      3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   H.   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days,
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
      3.   Meet the floodplain development permit requirements and the
elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in this title. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (2001 Code § 89-4-
609; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-07, 2-2-2010; Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective at
12 noon on January 6, 2020)
13-6E-10: VARIANCES IN F-P ZONES:
   A.   The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgments on requests for
variances from the requirements of this title.
   B.   The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal
only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of
this article.
   C.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of
adjustment with respect to an F-P zone, may appeal such decision to the
district court on the record developed by the board of adjustment, and not de
novo.
   D.   The city engineer shall maintain a record of all actions involving an
appeal and shall report variances to the state and/or federal emergency
management agency upon request.
   E.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
on the state's corollary listing, without regard to the procedures set forth in
the remainder of this section.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection
13-6E-7B7 of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   G.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
article, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
article.
   H.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   I.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   J.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with other provisions of this code or state or federal law.
      3.   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   K.   Variances may be allowed by the board of adjustment for new
construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary
for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
      1.   The floodplain development variance criteria provided in this title
are met, and
      2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 10-07, 2-2-2010; amd. Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective
at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
13-6E-11: ENCROACHMENTS IN F-P ZONES:
Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement,
placement of manufactured homes, and other developments are prohibited unless
certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge. (2001 Code § 89-4-609; 2009 Code § 8-
12-6; amd. Ord. 10-07, 2-2-2010)

city ordinances, master plans and the public improvement standards,
specifications and plans. (2001 Code § 89-4-609; amd. 2009 Code § 8-12-1; Ord.
10-30, 10-13-2010)
13-6E-13: FILL:
Fill shall not be deposited in a floodway unless approved by the city. Any
proposed fill must be shown to have some beneficial purpose. The amount of fill
shall not be greater than is necessary to achieve that purpose. A person or
entity proposing such fill shall submit to the city a plan showing the uses to
which the filled land will be put and the final dimensions of the proposed area
to be filled. Fill areas shall be protected against erosion by riprap,
vegetation cover, or bulkheads. (2001 Code § 89-4-609; amd. 2009 Code § 8-12-2;
Ord. 10-30, 10-13-2010)

   D.   Underground Storage Tanks:
      1.   Before the planning commission approves a conditional use permit for
underground storage tanks and associated piping and distribution appurtenances
in any zone, the owner shall provide:
         a.   Documentation of existing geologic and hydrogeologic conditions
at and beneath the proposed site of development. This shall include, at a
minimum, soil and rock formation types, thicknesses and depths; depth to water
table, to potable water, and to the city well production zone; groundwater flow
directions and gradient; and any geologic structural or hydraulic barriers
between the proposed tank locations and the city well production zone. If
available, the owner may obtain this information from existing reports or data,
or s/he may obtain the services of a registered geologist to procure the data.
This may require installation of one or more boreholes or test wells; and
         b.   Engineering plans that show the type of tanks to be installed,
the method of installation, distribution methods, filling mechanisms, and that
the tanks meet the following minimum requirements:
            (1)   The tanks shall meet or exceed all applicable federal, state,

environmental response and remediation rules and regulations;
            (2)   The tanks and piping shall be of noncorrosive double walled
material;
            (3)   Leak detection alarms shall be required for both tanks and
piping;
            (4)   All tanks shall be installed in watertight concrete vaults
equipped with manway access for visual inspection. Tanks shall be supported off
the vault floor to allow ready visual inspection of all tank top, sides and
bottom. Vaults shall be equipped with local and remote leak detection alarm
systems;
            (5)   An operation and maintenance plan shall be required for all
tanks and piping and shall include a visual inspection program. Visual
inspection and maintenance shall be required at least monthly;
            (6)   Monitoring and alarm equipment shall be inspected and tested
at intervals not to exceed three (3) months;
            (7)   All state and local tank and piping testing and monitoring
requirements shall be strictly adhered to;
            (8)   The plans shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed
engineer; and
            (9)   Tank installation shall meet or exceed the requirements of
the international building code, international fire code and the Underwriters
Laboratories, as applicable; and
         c.   A properly completed spill protection, control and countermeasure
(SPCC) plan with the engineering plan. The SPCC plan shall include provisions
for response to both surface and underground fuel spills and releases. The SPCC
plan shall be certified by a licensed engineer.
      2.   A conditional use permit for underground storage tanks and
associated piping and distribution appurtenances in protection zone 2 shall be
prohibited, unless the proposed owner/installer demonstrates that there is no
reasonable alternative zone in which the tanks can be installed. (2001 Code §
89-4-708; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011)
13-6F-9: REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS:
All development plans that lie within the primary recharge area shall be
reviewed by a geologist or hydrogeologist who has demonstrated expertise in the
assessment of recharge rates. Any development that will result in a loss of the
beneficial use of groundwater or that may have an adverse or negative effect
upon local groundwater quality shall be rejected. Plans that are rejected may
be revised by the developer and resubmitted to the city for subsequent review
by a registered geologist. Developments that do not lie within either the
primary or secondary recharge area may proceed with the development plan
processing requirements of the city. (2001 Code § 89-4-709)

13-6G-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   The transit station overlay district (TSOD) is established to promote
transit oriented development in areas that are generally located within an
approximate one-fourth (1/4) mile of light rail transit stations or cross town
satellite hubs for bus/trolley rapid transit.
   B.   The TSOD district consists of six (6) different transit community
station types located strategically at light rail or fast rapid transit stops
throughout the city. The transit community stations are established to promote
and share a number of transit oriented development concepts, but also have
their own emphasis on specific uses allowed within each station planning area
based on its location in the city. The uses are classified separately based on
intensity of use and the existing zoning in the area. The overlay districts are
intended to work as an incentive to create clustered, mixed use and pedestrian
friendly neighborhoods and working environments. The objectives of the overlay
district are to:
      1.   Permit and support higher development densities to encourage the
utilization of mass transit, and alternative modes of transportation other than
the automobile.
      2.   Allow for mixed land uses which contain a flexible arrangement of
residential, commercial and mixed use developments, while adopting detailed
urban development standards to ensure compatibility between the uses and
pedestrian activity.
      3.   Minimize distances between destinations by providing for a number of
conveniences and uses, which are compatible with one another, and which are
within an approximate one-fourth (1/4) mile walking distance of each other
(i.e., home to office, home to retail service, or office to retail service).
      4.   Promote pedestrian friendly design and architectural structuring
that encourages walking and bicycling.
      5.   Reduce transportation spending and increase housing affordability
through the lessening of transportation development and maintenance costs.
      6.   Increase incentives for developers from less money and land spent on
parking and road installation and maintenance costs.
      7.   Decrease auto dependency by providing alternative methods of
transportation, and provide planning methods which take into consideration
those who cannot drive or afford an automobile.
      8.   Create and enhance cultural use areas that promote neighborhood and
local social activities.
      9.   Integrate open spaces, plazas, courtyards and pocket parks, and
connect these areas to all other uses in the station district.
      10.   Provide for a development plan that has economic viability, where
the city will benefit from the project as a whole in the form of tax
increments, private investment and the creation of new jobs.
      11.   Allow for greater flexibility in street and road infrastructure
features that distinguish the area as unique, create a distinctive ambiance to
the development, and reduce maintenance costs through reduced parking and right
of way widths. (2001 Code § 89-4-801; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6G-2: ESTABLISHMENT:
The TSOD applies standards in addition to and different from the established
standards of the underlying zoning district in this title. The TSOD is
designated on the zoning map by affixing the suffix "TSOD" in parenthesis after
the underlying zoning district in which the overlay is located, i.e., SC-2
(TSOD). The TSOD regulations and standards supersede the regulations and
standards of the underlying zoning district. (2001 Code § 89-4-802; amd. 2009
Code; Ord. 10-20, 7-28-2010)
13-6G-3: TRANSIT STATION BOUNDARIES:
The six (6) transit community station types are:
   A.   West Jordan City Center Station Community: The West Jordan city center
station community, when developed, will contain a mix of compact but compatible
uses. The multiple uses in this station community consist primarily of multi-
family, commercial, retail, office, municipal, entertainment and mixed uses.
The highest development densities shall be allowed within this station
community and all land uses are to be pedestrian oriented and well connected to
open spaces, parks, plazas and social gathering areas. A large multitransit
station hub is envisioned for this station community.
   B.   Jordan Valley Community: The Jordan Valley community is intended to be
a mixed use development of residential, commercial, office, retail and
recreational uses. High development densities shall be allowed within this
station community, with a primary focus on high density residential being
supported by a nonresidential mix of uses. It is essential that the transit
station be easily accessible by all proposed development through well designed
walkways within this community. All land uses are to be pedestrian oriented and
well connected to open spaces, parks, plazas and social gathering areas.
   C.   Gardner Village Station Community: The intent of this station community
is to provide easy and convenient access to existing commercial retail services
and restaurants and to serve as a commencement point for recreational
activities at the adjacent trailhead for the Jordan River Parkway. Land uses
shall contain a mix of retail services and various types of medium to high
density residential uses within an easy walking distance to the proposed
transit station. Land uses in this station community need not be entirely
supportive of each other. However, the multiple uses must link to a pedestrian
network of trails and sidewalks and to the transit station.
   D.   Residential Station Community: The prevailing use in the residential
station community areas is single-family residential. The intent of the
residential station community is to provide walkable access to and from the
proposed transit station for the existing residential neighborhoods.
Nonresidential uses need not be provided nor are they necessary within this
community station. A pedestrian walkway network shall be installed that will
support transit ridership in the immediate vicinity. A park and ride lot shall
be provided near each station for residents who live in the vicinity who may
wish to travel by alternative methods.
   E.   Bagley Station Community: The Bagley station community is intended to
serve the light industrial work force in and around the southwestern portion of
the city. Transit riders served by this transit station will primarily be going
to or coming from work. It will be necessary to serve the area with improved
pedestrian network systems for safe walking, and it will be vital for this
station to accommodate a park and ride lot and bus station. It may also benefit
some of the large businesses in the area to serve their transit riders with
shuttles.
   F.   5600 West BRT Station Communities: There is a possibility that the city
will be served by bus rapid transit or trolley in the future. This alternative
method of transit could allow the city to develop small pockets of transit
oriented type uses at major transit stop sites. These stations would primarily
be mixed use with an approximate overlay of one- fourth (1/4) mile radius
around the proposed BRT stop sites located at: 5600 West Old Bingham Highway,
5600 West 9000 South, and 5600 West 7800 South. Uses in these stations shall
contain a mix of compacted but compatible uses with an emphasis of high density
multi-family and moderate community commercial uses. Pedestrian safety will be
a key component of these transit stations. Design of this station community
shall be pedestrian friendly where transit commuters and shoppers do not have
to compete with the automobile. A park and ride facility or parking structure
should be placed within a reasonable distance of a proposed transit station in
this community. (2001 Code § 89-4-803; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-20, 7-28-2010)

2010; Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011)
13-6G-5: DENSITY:
The following density requirements shall apply to all residential uses in the
applicable TSOD:
 
Overlay Station         Minimum Residential Density Maximum Residential Density
                        Per Acre                    Per Acre
West Jordan City center 30 units                    75 units
Jordan Valley           30 units                    75 units
Gardner Village         Same as underlying zone     Same as underlying zone
Residential stations    Same as underlying zone     Same as underlying zone
Bagley                  n/a                         n/a
5600 West BRT stations  15 units                    30 units
 
Density in the TSOD is calculated by dividing the number of proposed dwelling
units by the number of gross acres designated for residential development
(including residential uses within a mixed use component of a development) on
the preliminary development plan. Proposed parking structures, parks and public
or private open space, including hardscaped areas, may be included in
determining the number of acres used in this calculation. However, areas
proposed for nonresidential uses other than those included within a mixed use
component of the development (i.e., commercial, office, church or school sites
that are not included in a mixed use component of a development) shall not be
used in determining residential density. (2001 Code § 89-4-805; amd. 2009 Code;
Ord. 10-20, 7-28-2010)
13-6G-6: STREET DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
All streets developed and maintained within a transit oriented development
shall comply with this title and title 8 of this code. The planning commission
may approve modified street standards in the final development plan if: a) the
developer presents a modified street standard that is superior to or more
consistent with a transit oriented development or can show that dedication or
development to city standards is impractical or undesirable due to severe
topography, security requirements, or other similar circumstances; and b) the
city engineer and fire chief make a positive recommendation to modify the
applicable street standards. (2001 Code § 89-4-806; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-20,
7-28-2010)
13-6G-7: STREETSCAPES:
   A.   Building line frontages contribute to the public streetscape and
therefore, are subject to more regulation than the rest of the lot. Buildings
shall be oriented to the pedestrian and placed close to the street space where
possible and consistent with the overall design and function of the building.
   B.   Park strips are required on all streets, except alleys, within each
station community right of way. Within commercial areas, park strips shall
serve the purpose of allowing for quick stops and shopping. In residential
areas, park strips shall serve as buffers between pedestrian walkways and
streets.
   C.   Street medians are encouraged in all station communities for all major
collector rights of way. Medians serve to improve the aesthetic quality of the
area and as a midblock resting place for street crossings. Medians should be a
minimum of five feet (5') wide.
   D.   Alleys and interior block spaces shall be allowed and encouraged in all
station communities. Alleys serve as alternate routes to garages and loading
docks that are unseen by the public and therefore, contribute to a pedestrian
friendly environment. The private, interior portions of the lots (toward the
alley) allow commercial operators to utilize these spaces as efficient working
environments unseen by the public and allow residents to have private and
semiprivate (for apartment and condominium buildings) gardens and courtyards.
Alleys shall be the primary access to garages. (2001 Code § 89-4-807; amd. 2009
Code; Ord. 10-20, 7-28-2010)
13-6G-8: SIDEWALKS AND PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION:
Convenient pedestrian circulation systems shall be provided to minimize
pedestrian-auto conflicts and shall be provided continuously throughout each
station community district. All streets, except for alleys, shall be bordered
by sidewalks on both sides of the right of way in accordance with the city
adopted public improvement standards, specifications and plans.
   A.   Sidewalks shall be required on every street within the station
communities. The minimum width for sidewalks shall be five feet (5') within
residential and commercial areas where trees and amenities are located in a
park strip. The minimum width for sidewalks in nonresidential areas where
trees, benches and public amenities are located within the sidewalk shall be a
minimum of eight feet (8') wide. Sidewalks in nonresidential areas should be
divided into three (3) zones:
      1.   Zone 1 shall be the area closest to the building and is the dining
and display area. This area serves for signs from businesses and eating and
resting areas for users.
      2.   Zone 2 shall be the area dedicated for the sidewalk, dedicated and
designed for pedestrian travel and through walkway traffic.
      3.   Zone 3 shall be the area closest to the street and is to be
considered an amenity zone. This area is used for landscaping, street trees,
benches, and other aesthetic and practical features that improve the quality of
the pedestrian environment.
   B.   Pedestrian walkways shall connect building entrances to each other and
connect building entrances, sidewalks and public streets to existing or planned
transit stops.
   C.   Where practical, pedestrian walkways shall be raised above the grade of
streets, drives, parking lots and other paved areas. Where pedestrian walkways
cannot be raised, they shall be constructed of a material differing in texture
from adjacent pavement.
   D.   Pedestrian crosswalks shall be clearly discernible with a different
color and texture from the adjacent pavement/concrete utilized for vehicular
circulation. (2001 Code § 89-4-808; amd. 2009 Code)
13-6G-9: PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
In order to encourage the use of public transit systems within transit oriented
developments the minimum number of parking spaces in the TSOD is intentionally
reduced. The use of shared parking areas and multilevel parking structures is
also strongly encouraged within station community districts. Surface parking
shall be minimized and located behind and/or to the side of main building
structures except when such surface parking as described in the development
plan is permitted within a given streetscape (on street parking), or when the
site is at the intersection of two (2) arterial streets. The parking
requirements and restrictions set forth in this article shall supersede the
requirements and regulations set forth in chapter 12 of this title.
   A.   General Parking Requirements: The following requirements and
restrictions shall apply to all uses allowed in each station community:
      1.   Multi-family uses must provide one parking space for every dwelling
unit, plus one-half (1/2) parking space for each additional bedroom. A maximum
of one and one-half (11/2) parking spaces is permitted for each multi-family
unit. Guest parking shall be provided at one stall for every four (4) dwelling
units.
      2.   A maximum of three (3) parking spaces per one thousand (1,000)
square feet of office and a maximum of three and three-fourths (33/4) per one
thousand (1,000) square feet of retail space is permitted. Properties within
the CC-F subdistrict shall meet subsection
13-5I-9D3 of this title.
      3.   Unless otherwise approved in the final development plan, other
permitted and conditional uses not included in subsection A1 or A2 of this
section shall provide up to fifty percent (50%) reduction of the parking
requirement for such uses set forth in chapter 12 of this title.
      4.   On street parking is permitted and encouraged and shall be included
in the total development required parking calculations for a use or structure
which fronts and is adjacent to the on street parking stall.
      5.   Ingress and egress for parking lots shall, where reasonably
practical, be from side streets for commercial uses and from alleys for
residential uses.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3513.gif]
 
      6.   A parking lot or garage may not be adjacent to a street
intersection; a parking lot or garage may be adjacent to a street intersection
if the street intersection is an intersection of two (2) arterial streets or
both a vehicular/arterial street and a pedestrian or neighborhood street.
      7.   Access for service vehicles and deliveries will be required to
provide a direct route to loading bays and service areas; minimizing movement
through parking areas.
      8.   The reduction of impervious surfaces is highly encouraged through
the use of interlocking pavers, particularly for areas with high pedestrian
traffic, intersections and crosswalks.
   B.   Reduction Of Parking Spaces: A developer may request a reduction in the
number of parking spaces by city approval, using the factors listed in
subsection
13-12-4B of this title. Requests for a reduction in parking spaces shall be
recommended by the zoning administrator and approved by the planning
commission.
   C.   Specific Parking Requirements: Except single-family residential,
parking provided for all new development shall comply with the following
standards:
      1.   A parking lot, garage, or vehicular maneuvering area shall be
located behind or on the side of a building. A parking lot, garage, or a
vehicular maneuvering area may be located in front of a building only when it
is found that a lot is adjacent to an intersection of two (2) arterial streets,
or both a vehicle/arterial street and a pedestrian or neighborhood street, or
the purpose of the vehicular maneuvering area is to provide a direct life
safety function. If parking is located to the side or front of the building,
all landscape and buffer requirements for parking areas within subsection
13-13-9C of this title shall apply.
      2.   Two (2) or more land uses with different hours of operation or
varying parking demands (example: office and restaurant) shall qualify for
shared parking if within six hundred feet (600') of each other. Parking shall
be accessible to all uses sharing the said parking.
         a.   Documentation for a shared parking request shall be provided with
the building permit application.
         b.   A document indicating a right to use the parking if not on the
same parcel where the parking is located shall be submitted.
         c.   A licensed traffic engineer or a certified transportation planner
shall prepare a study, demonstrating modal split for project employers and/or
visitors and parking demand for each anticipated use and/or business within the
project.
         d.   The estimate of parking demand shall include average daily and
peak period demand.
      3.   For mixed use development, a shared parking approach shall be
implemented unless infeasible. The applicant shall demonstrate to the zoning
administrator why shared parking is not feasible and that the total amount of
parking to be provided will not comprise more than one hundred ten percent
(110%) of the average daily peak demand.
      4.   Tandem parking spaces for all single-family residential attached,
residential duplex, and residential townhouse units shall be permitted. Tandem
parking may be used with multi- family developments when the use of tandem
parking spaces can be assigned to individual units and can be under the control
of single households.
      5.   Parking structures are encouraged to maximize usable land and to
reduce the need for surface parking lots. Structures should provide for shared
parking where possible and needed for the given land uses. Parking structures
should be located away from the immediate streetscape where possible; provided,
however, that parking structures shall be permitted adjacent to streetscapes
where the design of such structures reflects the overall design of the project
of which they are a part and/or landscaping is placed between the parking
structure and the streetscape. Options for placement include center of block,
above ground, below ground, and alley access sites.
      6.   Parking structures shall include pedestrian walkways and connections
to continuous pedestrian paths/sidewalks.
      7.   Parking structures shall be architecturally integrated or designed
with the same theme as the entire station community development or adjacent
main buildings.
      8.   Parking structures with blank facades and solid walls at grade are
not permitted except as approved pursuant to an approved development plan or
where buffered by not less than five feet (5') of landscaping. Remote signage
may be used to break up blank facades and solid walls and to add visual
interest to the exterior of the parking structure.
      9.   Storage parking of recreational vehicles shall not be permitted in
the TSOD except where facilities for such storage are specifically approved
pursuant to a development plan. (2001 Code § 89-4-809; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-
20, 7-28-2010; Ord. 13-07, 3-13-2013; Ord. 14-19, 5-28-2014)
13-6G-10: BICYCLE PARKING AND BIKE LANES:
   A.   The requirements and recommendations for bicycle parking and bike lanes
set forth in this chapter shall supersede the requirements of chapter 12 of
this title.
   B.   The recommended number of bicycle stalls shall be based on the
following, provided, however, that a different number of bicycle parking stalls
may be provided in accordance with an approved development plan:
 
Land Use                 Stall Requirement
Industrial uses          1 stall per 5,000 square feet of gross floor area
Multi-family residential 1 stall per 3 dwelling units
Office uses              1 stall per 2,000 square feet of gross floor area
Park and ride facilities 1 stall per 25 parking stalls
Retail uses              1 stall per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area
Station stop             10 stalls
 
   C.   Bicycle parking facilities must be located in a well lit area that is
reasonably proximate to the core commercial building or common facility
entrance. Long term bicycle parking facilities located within structures is
encouraged.
   D.   Bike lanes shall be provided according to city master plans, as
modified pursuant to an approved development plan, and construction standards.
Bike lanes shall be delineated from the rest of the street space with a
demarcated path.
   E.   Where provided, bicycle parking racks or other bicycle storage
facilities shall be designed to deter theft. Bicycle parking areas shall be
designed so as to provide reasonably sized storage and maneuvering space for
such parking areas. (2001 Code § 89-4-810; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-20, 7-28-
2010)
13-6G-11: ARCHITECTURAL, BUILDING AND SITE DESIGN STANDARDS:
A variety of architectural features and building materials is encouraged to
give each building or group of buildings a distinct character.
   A.   Height: New structures within the TSOD shall be no more than forty five
feet (45') high for single-family residential, and seventy five feet (75') for
mixed use structures, except for new structures in the residential station
communities and the city center station community. Those communities shall meet
the criteria for height as stated in the underlying zoning districts. The
height requirements for commercial, office and industrial structures shall be
dictated by the underlying zoning districts. An increase to the maximum height
requirement for a structure may be granted by the planning commission through a
conditional use permit.
   B.   Building Facades And Entryways:

public or private right of way and shall be set back as near the sidewalk edge
with as minimal a setback as possible unless differently approved pursuant to a
development plan. The setback of a building may be increased to a maximum of
twenty feet (20') from a public or private right of way, if a courtyard, plaza,
promenade, social event area or outdoor dining area is incorporated into the
development's design. Parking lots, garages and drive lanes shall not be
allowed between the right of way line of a public or private road (exclusive of
alleys) and any building. This shall not include parking structures that are
architecturally compatible with a master planned development. Lots at the
intersection of two (2) arterial streets are exempt from this criterion. (2001

   D.   Street Walls And Garden Walls: Street and garden walls shall establish
a distinct edge to the street space where the buildings do not. Masonry walls
should define the outdoor space and separate the street space from the private
realm (parking lots, trash cans, gardens and equipment). The finished side
shall face the street space. A street wall is a masonry wall set back not more
than eight inches (8") from the required building line or adjacent building
facade. A vehicle entry gate (opaque, maximum 18 feet wide) and a pedestrian
entry gate (maximum 6 feet wide) are both allowed as limited substitutions
within any required street wall length. The following materials are permitted:
      1.   Native/regional stone and equivalent imitation stone;

meet the minimum standards developed by the Illumination Engineering Society.
Materials and equipment chosen for lighting fixtures should be durable and
weather well. Lighting is desirable for nighttime visibility, crime deterrence
and decoration; however, to avoid lighting that is too bright, creates glare,
hinders night vision, or creates light pollution, all lighting shall be
shielded to prevent uplighting and light escape. A standard list of approved
lighting fixture choices will be available for each station community, as
approved by the city.

locations for the development of appropriate living arrangements, both assisted
and independent, including independent elderly housing, nursing homes,
convalescent centers and assisted living centers or similar uses as interpreted
by the Planning Commission for residents fifty five (55) years and older. The
SHO District provides standards for development which recognizes and
accommodates the varied housing and lifestyle needs and desires of seniors,
including decreasing mobility, changing health and the alternative needs of the
senior person. The SHO District promotes independence and a high quality of
life to meet the physical and social needs of seniors by encouraging
specialized design features, and convenient access to community and civic
centers, support services, mass transit stations and stops, recreational
facilities, and shopping centers. This overlay zone is not intended for
hospitals, clinics, health care centers, or like uses. (Ord. 11-03, 2-9-2011;

13-6I-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   General Purpose: The general purpose of the Infill Development Overlay
(IDO) Districts are to promote and facilitate the development and redevelopment
of infill properties that cannot be reasonably developed using currently
adopted zoning, subdivision and engineering standards. IDO Districts provide
for the establishment of specific land uses and development standards as
incentives to stimulate re-investment and development of properties in a manner
that will contribute to the creation of a high quality development for
residential, commercial, and employment opportunities and improve the overall
economic vitality of the City. It is the intent of these districts to
generally:
      1.   Encourage flexibility in the development, redevelopment, investment
and reinvestment of infill properties that meet the criteria listed in section
13-6I-2 of this article, without an overall increase in the density as
established by the General Plan Future Land Use Map and base zoning district.
      2.   Encourage the use of innovative approaches to development that
utilize sustainable development practices as shown in a required development
plan.
      3.   Encourage a mix of uses in close proximity of each other to promote
pedestrian activity and reduce vehicle miles traveled. This goal includes
consideration of off-site activities.
      4.   Facilitate the development, redevelopment, and use of properties in
West Jordan where public infrastructure is already in place.
   B.   Specific Purposes Of Each District: There are two (2) Infill
Development Overlay Districts:
      1.   IDO-1: The IDO-1 District is for use with small sites of less than
five (5) acres that need relief from only a few development standards in order
to develop or redevelop.
      2.   IDO-2: The IDO-2 District is for use with sites of 2.5 to ten (10)
acres that would benefit from a more comprehensive modification of standard
development requirements in order to develop or redevelop. (Ord. 17-19, 4-5-
2017)
13-6I-2: ESTABLISHMENT:
   A.   An IDO District may be established for any area where the City Council

      1.   Does not exceed five (5) net acres, and has been in its current
configuration for more than ten (10) years; or does not exceed ten (10) net
acres and was created by the assembly of individual, contiguous parcels, each
not more than five (5) acres in area; and
      2.   Is served by, or has direct access to, existing utility distribution
facilities; and
      3.   Is surrounded by properties within a one thousand foot (1,000')
radius, measured from the property lines, excluding properties separated from
the subject site by arterial roads, highways/freeways, or other significant
transportation barriers, in which:
         a.   The total developable land area is not more than twenty five
percent (25%) vacant; and
         b.   Greater than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of lots or
parcels have been developed fifteen (15) or more years ago.
   B.   The City Council may also find that the area within the overlay
district meets at least two (2) of the following requirements:
      1.   There is a majority percentage of vacant or dilapidated buildings or
structures; or

each applicable general land use category, calculate the number of spaces
required for each use, assuming it is the only use (refer to the schedule of
minimum off street parking requirements in section
13-12-3 of this title). Use that figure for each land use to calculate the
number of spaces required for each time period for each use (6 time periods per
use). For each time period, add the number of spaces required for all
applicable land uses to obtain a grand total for each of the six (6) time
periods. Select the time period with the highest total parking requirement and
use that total as the shared parking requirement;

intersection if the street intersection is an intersection of two (2) arterial
streets or both a vehicular/arterial street and a pedestrian or neighborhood
street;
      9.   Parking Aisles: Insofar as possible, all parking aisles should be
double loaded (parking on both sides) in order to minimize the amount of
pavement needed for pavement areas for vehicle circulation and maneuvering;
      10.   Pedestrian Walkways: Convenient, marked pedestrian walkways shall
be provided within the interior of a parking lot;
      11.   Lighting Fixtures: Lighting fixtures shall be installed within
required vehicular parking lots. Parking lot lighting shall be installed in
medians, landscaped islands or within landscape buffers, wherein stand-alone

13-6K-4: Uses
13-6K-5: Development And Design Requirements
13-6K-6: Administration
13-6K-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   General Purpose.  The general purpose of the Interchange Overlay Zone
(IOZ) is to promote and facilitate the development and redevelopment of large
properties with an influx of new residential, commercial and mixed-use
development to promote and maintain the viability of interchange areas. It is
the intent:
      1.   To utilize the Mountain View Corridor (SR-85) and Bangerter Highway
(SR-154) to enhance the City image, build communities of distinction, create
jobs, and assure long term sustainable development that contributes to the
financial and social well-being of the City.
      2.   To manage and promote appropriate uses around specified interchanges
along the Mountain View Corridor and the Bangerter Highway.
      3.   To assure that market demand is strategically distributed between
the potential interchanges.
      4.   To improve property and sales tax generation by locating and
attracting land uses that benefit the City within the corridors.
      5.   To reinforce the land use relationship between interchanges which
will allow appropriate intensification and densification where it is
appropriate.
      6.   To establish standards with sufficient detail to assure quality
architecture, site planning, enduring neighborhoods, and commercial viability.
      7.   To provide a proactive series of expectations from developers and to
avoid processes that are reactive to development proposals.
      8.   To enhance the potential for compatible development with surrounding
uses and a positive appearance from the adjacent freeway and highway.
      9.   To design areas in a way that design off-sets any residential
density impacts.
      10.   To assure walkable connected communities are designed from the
ground up. (Ord. 19-34, 11-13-2019)
13-6K-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   This overlay is only allowed at specific locations that are impacted by
the Mountain View Corridor and Bangerter Highway.  The locations where the IOZ
may be adopted are shown on Figure 1 - Interchange Overlay Zone Map.  The
overlay varies the allowed uses by interchange to assure improved market demand
as per the following:
      1.   Old Bingham Highway and Mountain View - primarily manufacturing
uses, commercial and transit-oriented development (area A).
      2.   90th South and Mountain View - a regional commercial area with
vehicle sales as the anchor and the potential for mixed non-residential uses
and residential uses north of New Bingham Highway corridor (area B).
      3.   90th South and Mountain View New Bingham Highway transition - the
area located east of Mountain View, west of 5600 West, south of 8600 South and
adjacent to the vacated New Bingham Highway.  The intent is to provide higher
density housing as a transition from commercial with vehicle sales to the
single family homes to the north of 8600 South. This area also has the
possibility of limited commercial uses.  This area cannot receive IOZ overlay
independent of area B (area C).
      4.   7800 South Mountain View - the intent is to provide for additional
higher density housing to the west of Mountain View and housing mixed with
limited commercial uses to the east (area D).
      5.   Highlands - area east and west of Mountain View off of 7800 South in
the Highlands Master Planned development. Intent is a mix of housing, office
and commercial (area E).

Figure 1 - Interchange Overlay Zone Map
      6.   To apply for the IOZ a property must be located in one of the areas
shown on Figure 1 - Interchange Overlay Zone Map.  The area must be minimum of
50 contiguous acres.  One parcel must be adjacent to both an interchange of the
Mountain View Corridor and the major road it accesses (78th South, 90th South,
Old Bingham Highway or 5600 West). If the area is located in a current (not
expired) adopted master planned project and lies within areas D or E as shown
on the Interchange Overlay Zone Map as of November 14, 2019, the proximity and
acreage requirements do not apply.
      7.   Any new development within the specified interchange areas as
defined on the zoning map, meeting the restrictions of subsection 6 may apply
for the IOZ. IOZ is an overlay and has no required relationship to the
underlying zone.
      8.   IOZ standards and requirements supersede any underlying zone, but
not necessarily other relevant chapters of the West Jordan code. This chapter
reflects the minimum requirements and where such requirements conflict with
other requirements of the code, these shall prevail. A development agreement
may include provisions that enhance or conflict with the standards found in
this chapter. (Ord. 19-34, 11-13-2019)
13-6K-3: PROCESS FOR IOZ AND PROJECT APPROVAL:
   A.   Feasibility preapplication meeting: Before application is made for a
zone change to the IOZ overlay zone, the entity proposing the change shall
first meet with the city staff to review and assess the feasibility of the
change and to refine the potential application.
   B.   Application: An application for a zone change to an IOZ zone shall
include a Master Development Plan ("MDP") and shall be submitted, according to
section

Master Development Agreement ("MDA") in a form acceptable to the City shall
also be required and presented to the planning commission as part of the
application review prior to consideration of the application by the city
council. The MDP shall follow the expiration time frames of section
13-5J-10 D, or as modified by the MDP and/or the MDA. The MDP shall be attached
to and be part of the MDA. And MDP shall include, as a minimum:
      1.   A conceptual site plan or plans, including sketches of the types of
buildings proposed, elevations of proposed buildings, parks, plazas, trails,
oblique sketches of the project to show any view related issues, and conceptual
street cross sections using this IOZ chapter as a guide to items that should be
addressed.
      2.   Design Guidelines: Design Guidelines shall be submitted with each
MDP and shall be approved by the city council, after receiving a recommendation
from the planning commission and the design review committee.
      3.   A written explanation of the project that describes the thematic
elements of the project, the place making concepts, one or more signature
features, proposed residential densities, commercial and mixed-use designs (if
applicable), and other details that will provide reasons that the development
will create a long term benefit to the City.
      4.   Master Development agreement - on a form acceptable to the City: (a)
specify and describe the proposed development through text, site plans and
elevations (b) detail the major concepts, building types, amenities,

West Jordan City may deem necessary, as described on the application form, for
proper review and analysis of a particular application.
   C.   Phase Sub-Area Development Plans: Each phase described in an MDP shall
be submitted in the form of a Phase Sub-Area Development Plan, following the
standards and guidelines established in the MDP, and shall be approved by city
staff.
   D.   Residential densities shall be established by the City Council, after
receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission and shall be adopted
with the master development plan and agreement.
   E.   Ownership at Time of Application: Each Master Development proposal
under the IOZ shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of
application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of
the property. (Ord. 19-34, 11-13-2019)

All development in the IOZ shall follow the adopted Interchange Overlay Zone
(IOZ) design and development standards and requirements on file with the City.
This section is intended to provide standards and requirements for the variety
of building types suggested for the IOZ. Defining building types focuses the
process on design and creates an understanding of what sort of development will
be found in the IOZ. All drawings are meant to represent design features and
not a style or theme that needs to be adhered to. (Ord. 19-34, 11-13-2019)

   B.   Work to commence - after final approval is granted and a final
development agreement recorded, work shall commence within 3 years. "Work" is
defined by the construction of foundations and access from surface roads. If
work has not begun within that time frame, the overlay zone will revert to the
underlying zone and the development agreement will be null and void. The three-
year limitation may be extended for good cause through a written request to the
City Council. Good cause should include substantial reasons such as financing
issues, delays resulting from issues of the land, and/or lack of material
availability, etc.
   C.   Minor plan modifications - as a plan is constructed, the Zoning
Administrator may approve modifications to the site approved site plan for up
to 10% of the physical layout. For any particular building, the façade

13-7A-5: Minimum Requirements For Adequate Public Facilities
13-7A-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   A.   The purpose of the adequate public facilities (APF) management system
is to establish an ongoing mechanism which ensures that public facilities and
services needed to support development are available concurrently with the
impacts of such development.
   B.   This article shall apply to all development in the city. (2001 Code §
89-5-201)
13-7A-2: APF MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
   A.   Adequate Public Facilities Management System Established: In order to
implement the city goals and policies, the adequate public facilities
management system (APF management system) is hereby established. The APF
management system is incorporated into and shall be part of development review
procedures, as well as the process for issuance of building permits.
   B.   General Requirements: Approval of all development shall be conditioned
upon providing adequate public facilities and services necessary to serve new
development. No building permit shall be issued unless such public facilities
and services are in place or the commitments described in section
13-7A-5 of this article have been made. Under the APF management system, the
following is required:
      1.   The city shall adopt and maintain level of service standards for the
following public facilities: water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, fire and
emergency services, and any other public facilities and services required by
the city; and
      2.   No site specific development plan or building permit shall be
approved or issued if such approval or issuance will result in a reduction in
the levels of service below the adopted level of service standards for the
affected facility. (2001 Code § 89-5-202; amd. 2009 Code)
13-7A-3: LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS:
For the purpose of review and approval of new development and the issuance of
building permits, the city hereby adopts the following level of service
standards for the public facilities and services identified in subsection
13-7A-2B1 of this article:

lines and stubs to each lot as required by applicable current city water master
plans and/or special district design criteria and construction standards.
   B.   Sanitary Sewer: All development shall provide adequate and functional
sanitary sewer mains and stubs to each lot as required by applicable current
city sanitary sewer master plans and/or special district design criteria and
construction standards.
   C.   Storm Drainage: All development shall provide storm drainage facilities
and appurtenances as required by this title and by all current city storm
drainage master plans, design criteria and construction standards.
   D.   Fire And Emergency Services: All development shall provide fire
suppression facilities as required by the fire code. Taking into consideration
speed limits and distances of roadways connecting a new development to said
fire suppression facilities, fire suppression facilities must be located within
a sufficient distance to allow for the following emergency response times to
ninety percent (90%) of the calls for emergency fire and medical service:
      1.   Four (4) minutes or less from the end of turnout time for the
arrival of the first arriving engine company at a fire suppression incident,
and eight (8) minutes or less for the deployment of a full first alarm
assignment at a fire suppression incident.
      2.   Four (4) minutes or less from the end of turnout time for the
arrival of a unit with first responder or higher level capability at an
emergency medical incident.
      3.   Eight (8) minutes or less from the end of turnout time for the
arrival of an advanced life support unit at an emergency medical incident where
this service is provided by the fire department.
      4.   Four (4) minutes or less from the end of turnout time for the
arrival of EMS for providing advanced life support. (2001 Code § 89-5-203; amd.
2009 Code)
13-7A-4: RESERVED:
(2009 Code; Ord. 13-33, 11-13-2013)
13-7A-5: MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES:
   A.   Standards Specified: The city APF management system shall ensure that
public facilities and services to support development are available
concurrently with the impacts of development. The following standards shall be
used to determine whether a development meets or exceeds the minimum
requirements for adequate public facilities:
      1.   For water and wastewater facilities, at a minimum, the city shall
require that, at the time of issuance of any building permit issued pursuant to
a site specific development plan, all necessary facilities and services, as
described in subsections
13-7A-3A and 3B of this article, are in place and available to serve the new
development in accordance with the approved utility plan or development
agreement for the development.
      2.   For storm drainage facilities, the city shall require that all
necessary facilities and services, as described in subsection
13-7A-3C of this article, are in place and available to serve the new
development in accordance with the approved drainage and erosion control
report, utility plans, or development agreement for such development.
   B.   Installation Schedule: The timing of installation of such facilities
and service shall be as follows:
      1.   Where multiple building permits are to be issued for a project,
twenty five percent (25%) of the building permits and certificates of occupancy
may be issued prior to the installation and acceptance of the drainage

applicable requirements outlined elsewhere in this code, the international
building code, international fire code, or any more restrictive provisions of
covenants, agreements or other ordinances or laws.
   C.   It is the intent of this article that any control exercised be the
minimum necessary to achieve the objectives as stated above. (2001 Code § 89-5-
301; amd. 2009 Code)
13-7B-2: SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Exceptions to Preliminary and Final Site Plan Reviews: Preliminary and
final site plan reviews are required for all developments in all zones, except
as provided below:
      1.   Residential Construction: Site plan review and the associated fees
shall not be required for residential dwellings in the residential or
agricultural zones.
      2.   Accessory Buildings and Additions: Site plan review and the
associated fees shall not be required for accessory buildings or main building
additions in residential or agricultural zones. Site plan review and the
associated fees shall not be required for up to two (2) accessory buildings or
main building additions per lot in other zones; provided, that the proposed
construction meets the following criteria:
         a.   The floor area of each proposed accessory building or main
building is not larger than twenty five percent (25%) of the floor area of the
existing main building to a maximum of five thousand (5,000) square feet.
         b.   Each proposed accessory building or main building addition meets
all zoning requirements.
         c.   Each proposed building or main building addition is

      3.   M-1 Site Plans: If a subdivision plat is required, a final plat, as
required by the city subdivision ordinance, must be completed before site plans
in the M-1 zone may be reviewed by the city planner. If the city planner
determines that the proposal is of significant size or complexity to warrant
review by the planning commission, the developer shall follow the procedures
for site plan review by the planning commission.
   B.   Application; Submittal Requirements: Any person or entity who seeks
development shall submit an application on the official form provided by the
development services department. Submittal requirements shall be as established
administratively by the department and shall include, but not be limited to: 1)
evidence of ownership or the type of controlling interest in the property; 2)
legal description of the property; 3) property owner; 4) the present zoning
classification; 5) the proposed use of the property; and 6) a scaled diagram of
the subject parcel and surrounding area. The applicant shall submit the
application, together with the applicable fee, to the development department.
Applications shall not be reviewed without the written consent of the property
owner except as provided herein. The burden of proof for all applications shall
be the responsibility of the applicant. (2001 Code § 89-5-302; amd. 2009 Code;
Ord. 19-50, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
13-7B-3: APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCESS:
   A.   For large scale developments, 5.1 acres or larger, a preapplication
meeting with staff and preliminary site plan review by the planning commission
is required. Public notice is required for the preliminary site plan review by
the planning commission. The final site plan shall be reviewed for consistency
with conditions of the approved preliminary site plan and a decision for
approval, or approval with conditions or denial shall be made by staff.
   B.   For small scale developments, five (5) acres or smaller, a
preapplication meeting with staff is required. Public notice is required for a
preliminary site plan review by the planning commission. Staff may review
preliminary and final site plans. However, if the city planner or the planning
commission determines that the project is of significant size or complexity,
preliminary review and a public hearing will be by the planning commission.
(2001 Code § 89-5-303; amd. 2009 Code)
13-7B-4: FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL:
Preliminary and final site plans shall be approved only if:
   A.   The proposed site plan is consistent with the intent of the goals and
policies of the general plan and the purpose of the zone district in which the
site is located;
   B.   The proposed site development plan's building heights, building
locations, access points, topography, and parking areas will not negatively
impact adjacent properties or the surrounding neighborhood;
   C.   The proposed development promotes a functional relationship of
structures to one another, both on the site and in the surrounding
neighborhood;
   D.   The height, location, materials, color, texture, area, setbacks and
mass, as well as parts of any structure (buildings, walls, signs, lighting,
etc.) and landscaping/open space, is appropriate to the development, the
neighborhood, and the community;
   E.   Ingress, egress, internal and external pedestrian and traffic
circulation, off street parking facilities, loading and service areas, and
pedestrianways is designed to promote safety and convenience;
   F.   The architectural character of the proposed structures is in harmony
with and compatible to structures in the neighboring environment and the
architectural character desired for the city, avoiding excessive variety or
monotonous repetition; and
   G.   Public facilities and services intended to serve the subject
development, including, but not limited to, roadways, parks and recreational
facilities, schools, police and fire protection, stormwater drainage systems,
water supplies, wastewater, power and refuse collection are adequate to serve
the site. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011)
13-7B-5: EXPIRATION OF APPROVED SITE PLANS:
   A.   An approved preliminary site plan shall remain valid for one year
following the date of the approval.
   B.   Approval of a final site plan shall become null and void if development
does not commence within two (2) years of the approval. For the purpose of this
section, "commencement of development" means installation of building
foundations. In phased developments, additional phases after the first one
shall receive final site plan approval within three (3) years of each other or
the preliminary site plan approval shall become null and void.
   C.   One 6-month extension may be granted by the zoning administrator for
approval of the preliminary and/or final site plan if, upon written request by
the owner/developer, the zoning administrator finds that the extension will not
adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare of the city. The decision
of the zoning administrator may be appealed to the planning commission 1 .
(2001 Code § 89-5-304; amd. 2009 Code)
 
Notes
1    1. See section
  15-5-2  of this code.
13-7B-6: GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Open Space:
      1.   Functional open space enhances circulation within a site and
contributes to the site's aesthetic qualities. When open space appears on a
site plan, it shall be designed to be accessible and usable by people.
      2.   With respect to open space, bigger is not necessarily better. A
series of small areas, each provided with attractive places to sit, etc., may
foster more human interrelationship than a large monolithic space. Open space
shall be created with comfortable places, attractive exhibits and easy access
to attract public use. Any public open space shall be designed to human scale
to encourage human interaction.
      3.   People are attracted to public areas with shade during large
portions of the summer in the city. Public space shall utilize shading by
arcades or landscaping unless otherwise prohibited by site visibility triangles
or other technical constraints.
   B.   Wall Plane Projections Or Recesses: Pedestrian or human scale of a
building within a project is an important element of site plan design. For this
reason, the facades of larger buildings shall be "broken up" by using wall
plane projections or recesses.
      1.   In the multiple-family residential zones (R-3), commercial zones (C-
G, C-M, SC-1, SC-2 and SC-3), and office zones (P-O and BR-P), facades greater
than fifty feet (50') long, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane
projections or recesses when they face a public or private street or are
adjacent to any residential zone. All other facades in these zones shall
incorporate wall plane projections or recesses on facades having horizontal
lengths of one hundred feet (100') or more.
      2.   In manufacturing zones (M-P, M-1 and M-2), facades greater than one
hundred feet (100') long, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane
projections or recesses. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed one
hundred (100) horizontal feet.
      3.   Buildings in commercial, office and manufacturing zones shall
incorporate at least one of the following architectural features in the design
of building facades: a repeating pattern such as a color change; texture
change; material module change; canopies or porticos; overhangs; arcades;
peaked roof forms; display windows; columns, pilasters or colonnades; or porte
cocheres.
      4.   Wall plane projections or recesses shall extend from, or be set
into, the predominant horizontal plane of the building not less than eight
inches (8") and shall be architecturally integrated to not appear to be an
afterthought. The minimum width of such features shall be not less than twenty
four inches (24") for columns, pilasters and other similar features. All other
architectural features shall be not less than seventy two inches (72") and
shall be equal to the height of the building, unless a lesser height is
approved by the planning commission.
   C.   Building Transition And Scale: An orderly transition created by such
means as stair stepping building height, breaking up the mass of the building,
and shifting building placement results in a coherent streetscape and mitigates
the impact of differing building scales and intensities. The proposed building
shall respect the scale of those buildings located on adjacent properties and,
where desirable, serve as an orderly transition to a different scale. In areas
undergoing change, long range plans shall be consulted for guidance as to
appropriate densities and intensities. This guideline shall not further
restrict development intensity and/or density from what is allowed in this
title.
   D.   Building Materials And Colors:
      1.   Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or earth
tone colors.
      2.   Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality,
durable materials, including, but not limited to, brick, rock, sandstone,
steel, stone, stucco, synthetic stone, tinted/textured concrete masonry units,
wood and masonry fiberboard simulating wood.
   E.   Building Placement: Existing developed pedestrian paths should be
respected. Building additions and alterations should not eliminate an existing
developed pedestrian path or public area.
   F.   Building Orientation:
      1.   Energy efficiency and comfort of its inhabitants are essential to
the successful design of a building. To the extent possible, building should be
oriented to minimize east/west exposures and should utilize high performance
technological solutions and/or shade control. The proposed building orientation
should respect climactic conditions by minimizing heat gain and considering the
impact of shade on adjacent land uses and areas.
      2.   Maintaining continuity of pedestrian routes is desirable. The
proposed building orientation should relate to other buildings on the same site
in regard to pedestrian circulation and surrounding buildings.
      3.   Service areas such as loading docks, refuse collection areas and
similar facilities that could be sources of odor, noise and smoke or could be
visually objectionable should not be located in highly traveled areas. Service
areas should be located away from public view.
      4.   Placement of the building in relation to the surrounding elements is
as important as the building design. The proposed building orientation should
respect the orientation of surrounding buildings and the orientation of
surrounding streets.
   G.   Equestrian Paths: An adequate surface and width for equestrian paths is
necessary for safe and dust free use. Where equestrian paths are provided, they
should be constructed of natural material or decomposed granite with a diameter
of one-half inch (1/2") or less to a depth of three (3) or four inches (4"),
and be a minimum of ten feet (10') wide.
   H.   Articulation:
      1.   Buildings should be accessible for pedestrians and public transit
users, not just for people driving private automobiles. Building entrances
should be identifiable and directly accessible from a public sidewalk.
      2.   A building should reflect a human scale and be inviting to the
public. The building facade should be designed to provide a sense of human
scale at ground level.
      3.   A controlled physical environment discourages criminal activities.
Facilities should have proper security lighting and consider security hardware,
surveillance measures and building design so that the facility provides a safe
environment.
   I.   Public Amenities:
      1.   Overhangs and canopies can provide a shaded walking area. Overhangs
and canopies should be integrated in the building design along all pedestrian
thoroughfares.
      2.   All facilities should be usable by everyone. Eliminating items that
are hazardous to the physically disabled makes the facilities safer for
everyone. All building access and site amenities should be accessible to the
physically disabled.
      3.   Pedestrian amenities help to encourage the use of public spaces.
Comfortable and attractive street furniture that is accessible to the
physically disabled should be provided in public spaces for public enjoyment
and comfort such as seating and tables for eating, drinking fountains, trash
receptacles, information kiosks and directories.
   J.   Overall Design Issues:
      1.   Incorporating bus shelters into the site design helps to maximize
their function and promotes greater usage. Where an existing or future bus stop
is located on a proposed site or on street frontage adjacent to a proposed
site, the proposed site plan shall demonstrate how the bus stop/shelter is
integrated with the site. The bus stop/shelter shall be located near building
entries and/or activity areas, or convenient to designated pedestrian walkways
between the bus stop/shelter and the building entry and/or activity areas. The
walkways shall be accessible to persons with disabilities and shall be shaded
and lighted.
      2.   Site design should consider its contribution to the established
street environment by enhancing views and promoting interaction for pedestrians
on the site. The proposed site plan should enhance the street context and take
into account view corridors along the street as well as the opportunity for
pedestrian interaction at street level.
      3.   Clearly defined buffers enhance the attractiveness of the
streetscape and promote pedestrian safety. The site plan should clearly express
the separation between pedestrian and vehicular traffic. (2001 Code § 89-5-308;
amd. 2009 Code)

and standards of operation, may have a greater impact than permitted uses on
adjoining properties, businesses or residences within the city. Such uses
require a more comprehensive review, including the ability of the city to
establish specific conditions for the project to mitigate any potential
impacts. The planning commission and zoning administrator can evaluate only
conditional uses listed and is empowered to grant, grant with conditions, or
deny any application for a use permit. Such review by the planning commission
and zoning administrator is subject to findings and the applicable hearing
requirements of this article. (2001 Code § 89-5-404; amd. 2009 Code)

in the property; b) legal description of the property; c) property owner; d)
the present zoning classification; e) the proposed use of the property; and f)
a scaled diagram of the subject parcel and surrounding area. The applicant
shall submit the application, together with the applicable fee, to the
development services department. Applications shall not be reviewed without the
written consent of the property owner. The burden of proof for all applications
shall be the responsibility of the applicant. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 11-35, 11-

anticipated detrimental effects of the proposed use in accordance with
applicable standards. These conditions may include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Requirements for setbacks, open spaces, buffers, fences or walls,
and landscaping to mitigate conflicts from visual, noise, lighting and similar
impacts associated with the use;

location of access points and on site circulation to mitigate traffic impacts
from increased volumes or nature of traffic activity associated with the use;
      3.   Regulations pertaining to hours of operation, methods of operation,
and phasing of the development of the site to mitigate impacts to surrounding
properties and the neighborhood; and
      4.   Time limits on the duration of the permit to determine if the use,
after a temporary period of operation, is materially detrimental or to evaluate
whether changed conditions in the neighborhood effect the capability of the use
to continue to adequately mitigate impacts to the surrounding area or the city
as a whole.
   B.   Denial: If the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of a proposed
conditional use cannot be substantially mitigated by the proposal or the
imposition of reasonable conditions to achieve compliance with applicable
standards, the conditional use shall be denied. (2009 Code)

   A.   The approval of a proposed conditional use by the planning commission
or the zoning administrator shall not authorize the establishment or extension
of any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or
moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing and processing of applications for any permits or approvals
that may be required by the regulations of the city, including, but not limited
to, a building permit, certificate of occupancy and subdivision approval.
   B.   The decision of the planning commission or zoning administrator shall

safety or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of
the proposed use or have an adverse effect on the property, adjacent
properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the city as a whole as a result of
the type of use or hours of operation;
   C.   The proposed site is adequate in size and shape to accommodate the
proposed use and that all requirements for the zone district, including, but
not limited to, setbacks, parking, on site circulation, screening, buffering
and landscaping are being met;
   D.   The proposed site has adequate access to public streets and highways to
carry the type and quantity of traffic which may be generated by the subject
use and on site circulation is adequate to permit driveways, parking and
loading requirements in a manner which is safe and efficient;
   E.   The proposed use will ensure compatibility with surrounding uses and
will use building materials that are in harmony with the area; and
   F.   Adequate conditions or stipulations have been incorporated into the
approval of the conditional use permit to ensure that any anticipated
detrimental effects can be mitigated.
   G.   Where applicable, the proposed use will have appropriate connections to
the city water and sewer utility systems, and its water meter and pipe design
shall be reviewed by the city engineer with due regard to the public health,
safety and welfare. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 10-24, 8-25-2010)
13-7E-9: EXPIRATION:
No conditional use shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months,
unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or unless a
certificate of occupancy is issued and a use commenced within that period, or
unless a longer time is requested and granted by the planning commission. The
approval of a proposed conditional use by the planning commission or zoning
administrator shall authorize only the particular use for which it was issued.
(2009 Code)
13-7E-10: REVOCATION:
A conditional use permit may be revoked by the development services director
after review and recommendation by the planning commission. The planning
commission shall hold a public hearing prior to recommending the revocation of
a conditional use permit. Any recommendation of the planning commission and any
final decision by the development services director to revoke a conditional use
permit shall require a finding of one or more of the following:
   A.   The conditional use is a nuisance or is detrimental to the public
health, safety or welfare;
   B.   The conditional use permit was obtained by fraud;
   C.   The conditional use for which the permit was granted has been altered;
   D.   The conditional use for which the permit was granted has ceased or has

13-7G-3: VARIANCE CRITERIA:
Before approving a request for variance, except in connection with variance
requests in an F-P zone (see section
13-6E-10 of this title), the board of adjustment shall make the following
findings:
   A.   Literal enforcement of this title would cause an unreasonable hardship
for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general purpose of
this title. The board of adjustment shall not find an unreasonable hardship if
the hardship is self-imposed or economic. To determine whether or not
enforcement of this title would cause unreasonable hardship, the board of
adjustment shall not find unreasonable hardship unless the alleged hardship:
      1.   Is located on or associated with the property for which the variance
is sought; and
      2.   Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood;
   B.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not
generally apply to other properties in the same district and relate directly to
the hardship complained of;
   C.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial
property right possessed by other property in the same district;
   D.   The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will
not be contrary to the public interest; and
   E.   The spirit of this title is observed and substantial justice done.
(2001 Code § 89-5-406; amd. Ord. 10-07, 2-2-2010)

The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the conditions
justifying a variance have been met. (2001 Code § 89-5-406)

denied shall not be accepted by the city sooner than twelve (12) months after
the date of such denial. (2001 Code § 89-5-406)

   C.   Development Standards: The builder, owner or developer of property
subject to this article shall comply with the following development standards:
      1.   In planning for the construction of buildings, the builder shall
take into account the normal flow of stormwater, topography and existing
stormwater control facilities. Where flooding may be a problem, driveways that

      2.   The owner, builder or developer shall install curb, gutter and
sidewalk. Design and construction of improvements shall be in compliance with
the city public improvement standards, specifications and plans manual.
         a.   The curb, gutter and sidewalk shall be installed concurrently
with construction of the residence if these improvements exist on either of the
adjacent lots or if at least twenty five percent (25%) of the lots on the same
block have existing curb, gutter and sidewalk. If a block is not defined by
intersecting streets, the twenty five percent (25%) rule will apply to all
properties within five hundred feet (500') in each direction along streets from
the property lines of the subject lot.
         b.   If the owner, builder or developer is not required to install
curb, gutter and sidewalk concurrently with construction of the residence
pursuant to subsection C2a of this section, the owner, builder or developer
shall provide a bond guaranteeing performance, meeting the requirements of
title 8, chapter 3, article C of this code.
   D.   Exception: The only exception to this section will be when a residence
is built in a subdivision that was previously approved without a requirement
for curb, gutter and sidewalk.
   E.   Road Base, Asphalt: As a condition of the issuance of a building
permit, any developer, builder or owner who develops or builds property
fronting on or adjacent to an existing paved city or private street shall
install road base and asphalt from the existing edge of pavement to the new
curb and gutter. Installation of the road base and asphalt shall comply with
the city public improvement standards, specifications and plans manual. (2001

In blocks with more than fifty percent (50%) of the buildable lots already
developed, the minimum front and rear yard requirement for new construction
shall be equal to the average of the front or rear yards existing on the
developed lots. However, this regulation shall not be interpreted to require a
front or rear yard of more than thirty feet (30') in depth. (2001 Code §89-6-
109)
13-8-8: HEIGHT LIMITATION EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Method Of Measurement: Where doubt exists as to the height of fences,

considered to be the minimum acceptable standards for facilities in such an
area. (2001 Code §89-6-110; amd. 2009 Code)
13-8-9: LOTS IN SINGLE OWNERSHIP DEVELOPED AS ONE BUILDING LOT:
When the common boundary separating two (2) or more contiguous lots in one
ownership is covered by a building or a permitted group of buildings, the lots
shall constitute a single building site and the side yard as required by this
title shall not apply to such common boundary line. The side yard requirements
of this title shall apply only to the exterior boundaries of the contiguous
lots. (2001 Code §89-6-111; amd. 2009 Code)
13-8-10: MINIMUM LOT AREA WHEN PORTION OF LOT ACQUIRED FOR PUBLIC USE:
If a portion of a lot or parcel of land which meets the minimum lot area
requirements of a respective zone is acquired for public use in any manner,
including by dedication, condemnation or purchase, and such acquisition reduces
the lot area below the minimum requirement, the remainder of the lot or parcel
shall nevertheless be considered as having the required minimum lot area if it
meets all of the following conditions:
   A.   Size:
      1.   The lot or parcel contains a rectangular space of at least thirty
feet by forty feet (30'x40'), exclusive of the applicable front and side yard
requirements and one-half (1/2) of the applicable rear yard requirements, and
such rectangular space is usable for a principal use or structure.
      2.   The lot or parcel has an area of at least one-half (1/2) the
required lot area of the zone in which the lot or parcel is located, except in
zones requiring a lot area of fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet or more, a
lot area of not less than six thousand (6,000) square feet shall be required.
   B.   Street Access: The lot or parcel has a minimum of twenty feet (20') of
frontage on a public street. (2001 Code §89-6-112; amd. 2009 Code)
13-8-11: MINIMUM LOT AREA TO BE PRESERVED:
   A.   Independent Lot Calculations: No portion of a minimum lot area required
by this title shall be used or considered as a part of another lot or parcel of
land for purposes of establishing or determining applicable property
development standards.
   B.   Transfer Of Required Yard Space Prohibited: Except as described in
section
13-8-10 of this chapter, no space needed to meet the width, yard, area,
coverage, parking, frontage or other requirements of this title for a lot or
building may be transferred, sold, bequeathed or leased apart from such lot or
building unless other space so complying is provided. No land shall be sold
which will result in a lot being created for building purposes that does not
comply with the provisions of this title. (2001 Code §89-6-113)
13-8-12: MOVED BUILDINGS:
   A.   Purpose: This section is to ensure that relocated buildings will not
have an adverse effect on property values and that the buildings will be
harmonious and compatible with existing and future anticipated development in
the area.
   B.   Conditional Use Permit Required: No persons shall place, move on, or
affix to land any building which was formerly located on another site without
first obtaining a conditional use permit. This section shall not regulate an
accessory structure having a floor area of two hundred (200) square feet or
less and a height of twelve feet (12') or less.

      1.   The relocated building will have no appreciable detrimental effect
on the living environment and property values in the area into which it is
moved;
      2.   The relocated building is consistent with the architectural style
and quality of buildings existing in the area into which the building is
proposed to be moved; and
      3.   The relocated building and the lot on which the building will be
relocated conforms to the requirements of this title and other applicable
codes.
   E.   Cash Bond Required: The owner or developer shall provide a cash bond or
other acceptable financial assurance in a form acceptable to the city attorney,
or lien on the property in sufficient amount to guarantee the obligations
imposed by this section for the completion of the remodeling of the relocated
building per criteria under this section prior to receiving a building permit.
   F.   Construction Time Period: Construction shall be completed within nine
(9) months from the date a building permit is issued. The planning commission
may grant an extension to this construction period not to exceed three (3)
months' time based on reasonable justifications. (2001 Code §89-6-114; amd.
2009 Code)
13-8-13: PROJECTIONS INTO YARDS:
   A.   Permitted: The following structures may project into any required yard:
      1.   Fences and walls in conformance with this code;
      2.   Landscape elements, including trees, shrubs, agricultural crops and
other plants; and

wheelchair lifts, access ramps or other access for persons with disabilities,
which are under four feet (4') in height, may project into a front, rear or
side yard subject to zoning administrator approval. The zoning administrator
may approve such project, after finding:
      1.   The encroachment caused by the proposed access modification is
justifiably necessary to meet the legitimate disability needs of the applicant;
and
      2.   The proposed projection would have no substantial adverse impact
upon the neighborhood. (2001 Code §89-6-115; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 11-35, 11-22-
2011)
13-8-14: STORAGE OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES IN RESIDENTIAL ZONE:

mailboxes.
   D.   Shall have no entry into the living space, which is visible from the
public right of way.
   E.   Shall have a gross floor area less than thirty three percent (33%) of
the gross floor area of the principal dwelling unit.
   F.   Shall not be leased or rented separately from the principal dwelling

13-8-19: GATED COMMUNITIES:
   A.   Review:
      1.   A conditional use permit is required for a gated community, as
identified in zoning district land use charts.
      2.   A proposed gated community shall be reviewed during the subdivision
and site plan review process. In the case of a gated community conversion,
amended subdivision and/or amended site plan approval is required.
   B.   Private Streets:
      1.   Gated communities shall contain private streets and be gated at all
access points.
      2.   All utilities, except for water, located within a gated community
shall be privately owned and maintained by a homeowners' association. When a
public road is to be vacated to become a private street, all city utilities,
except for water, within the confines of such road shall also be vacated and
come under private ownership and management. Vacated utilities shall not
service other public customers outside the gated community boundary.
      3.   Private utilities shall be in conformance with the city subdivision
ordinance and the engineering standards, specifications and design manual.
      4.   Private streets shall conform to street design standards, as found
in the city subdivision ordinance and the city road and bridge standards. In
the case of a gated community within the PRD zone, the planning commission may
approve an alternate design as part of the final development plan, as outlined
in subsection
13-5C-8D of this title.
      5.   Private streets within gated communities shall contain pedestrian
sidewalks on both sides of the street. In the case of a gated community within
the PRD zone, the planning commission may approve an alternate design as part
of the final development plan, as outlined in subsection
13-5C-8D of this title.
      6.   A street and utility maintenance plan shall be provided by the
developer or homeowners' association for staff review at the time of final
development plan application. This street and utility maintenance plan shall
include, but not be limited to, general road maintenance, solid waste and green
waste collection, snow removal, sign maintenance, utility maintenance and
streetlight maintenance.
   C.   Access Standards:
      1.   Notwithstanding subsection
14-5-5B of this code, if approved by the planning commission, a gated community
may have a single point of ingress and egress, or may have two (2) ingress and
egress points, with the second access point designated as an exit only and/or
emergency access only. Otherwise, a gated community must have a minimum of two
(2) functioning points of ingress and egress as required by subsection
14-5-5B of this code.
      2.   The planning commission shall make the following findings when
approving one ingress and egress point for a gated community. The city engineer
may require a traffic impact study be submitted with any application for less
than the two (2) required fully functioning access points:
         a.   The development can be adequately served by emergency and safety
personnel with only one or more ingress and egress points.
         b.   Having only one access point would not cause discontinuity in the
existing or proposed public street system (i.e., street layout), including
pedestrian traffic.
         c.   Having only one access point would not distribute an unacceptable
amount of traffic through an existing or future neighborhood than would
otherwise result if another ingress and egress point were provided.
      3.   Pedestrian access separate from the vehicular movement area shall be
provided. In the case where a gated community obtains approval from the
planning commission to have only one access point as outlined in subsection C1
of this section, and the community does not have a paved pedestrian connection
to another subdivision or to public facilities like trails, parks and
libraries, the pedestrian access point may be gated.
   D.   Turnaround Standards:
      1.   All dead end streets resulting from a gated community development or
conversion greater than one hundred fifty feet (150') in length shall contain a
turnaround in conformance with subsection
14-5-5F of this code, and with the city public improvement standards,
specifications and plans manual. Such streets shall also be signed as dead end
streets on all approaches from other streets, with the cost of such new signage
borne by the applicant.
      2.   The city engineer and fire marshal may approve an alternate design
for turnarounds if the design allows for the proper turn radius or back out
maneuvering space for emergency and public services vehicles.
   E.   Gate Standards:
      1.   One-way access gates shall contain a minimum of twenty feet (20') in
width and two-way access gates shall contain a minimum of twenty four feet
(24') in width. A clear width of twelve feet (12') must be maintained between
any islands to be constructed for a card reader, keypad, guard house, landscape
feature, etc. City standards for gate access areas can be found in the West
Jordan road and bridge standards, appendix A.
      2.   A turnaround or turnout shall be provided in front of the gate in
cases where a vehicle is denied entry. City standards for such turnouts can be
found in the West Jordan road and bridge standards, appendix A.
      3.   Queuing distances from the public rights of way shall be determined
by the number of dwelling units in the development, as found in the West Jordan
road and bridge standards, appendix A.
      4.   Vehicular and pedestrian access gates shall be approved by the city
and contain a fail-open device to open the gates during power failures and be
equipped for emergency access. All emergency access systems must be approved by
the fire and police departments.
      5.   Vehicular access gates must automatically open for vehicles exiting
a gated community.
   F.   Conversion To Gated Community: An existing platted residential
subdivision that wants to become a gated community must receive preconstruction
approval from the planning commission and must meet all gated community
standards as outlined in this section. If the development has existing public
streets and public utilities, the city council must approve a street and
utility vacation prior to the development receiving amended subdivision and/or
amended site plan approval. The city engineer may require a traffic impact
study with any application for a gated community conversion. The planning
commission shall make the same findings for a proposed gated community as for a
newly proposed gated community.
   G.   Gated Community And Gated Community Conversion Criteria: Prior to
approving any application for a gated community or gated community conversion,
the planning commission shall make positive findings on the following criteria:
      1.   The use of gated private streets would not cause discontinuity in
the existing or proposed public street system (i.e., street layout), including
pedestrian traffic.
      2.   The use of gated private streets cannot limit or prevent public
street access to other properties.
      3.   The use of gated private streets would not distribute an
unacceptable amount of traffic through an existing or future neighborhood than
would otherwise result if public streets were used.
      4.   Gated private streets shall not impair access to or from public
facilities, including schools, parks and libraries.
      5.   The police and fire departments have determined adequate emergency
services can be provided to the proposed gated community as necessary to
protect the public health and safety.
      6.   Utilities proposed for vacation do not service public customers
outside the proposed gated community boundary, nor will vacation be detrimental
to the city utility system as a whole.
   H.   Maintenance Plan: In the case of a street and utility vacation, a
street and utility maintenance plan and homeowners' association creation
documentation must be provided by the developer or homeowners' association and
approved by the planning commission. This street and utility maintenance plan
shall include, but not be limited to, general road maintenance, solid waste and
green waste collection, snow removal, sign maintenance, utility maintenance and
streetlight maintenance. (2001 Code §89-6-120; amd. Ord. 13-17, 4-24-2013)
13-8-20: SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES (ADULT DAYCARE, GROUP HOMES (LARGE),

   A.   General Requirements For All Special Residential Facilities:
      1.   Purpose Statement: The purpose of this section is to permit the
establishment of adult daycare, group homes (large), transitional homes and
residential substance abuse treatment homes for "persons with disabilities" as
defined in section
13-2-3 of this title, subject to state and local licensing procedures and
conditional use standards.
      2.   See Table Of Uses: The table of permitted and conditional uses for
each zoning district specifies where special residential facilities are
allowed.
      3.   License Required: No special residential facility shall be
established, operated or maintained within the city without a valid license
issued by the Utah state division of licensing, department of human services,
and without a valid business license issued by the city's business license
authority.
      4.   Location: No special residential facility shall be located within a
three hundred foot (300') radius of another special residential facility,
measured property line to nearest property line in a direct line of travel.
Adult daycare facilities in nonresidential zoning districts (excluding mixed
use zones) are exempt from this spacing requirement; and
      5.   Notification: Prior to building or opening any special residential
facility, the owner or developer shall notify the owners of every property
located within a radius of at least three hundred feet (300') (as part of the
conditional use notification) of the proposed location in writing concerning
the planned operations, opening of the facility and the schedule therefor.
Delivery to the city of an affidavit proving such notice was given is a
condition to the issuance of any conditional use, building or occupancy permit
and the issuance of any business license. (Ord. 12-01, 2-22-2012; Ord. 12-14,

13-8-23: ANNUAL CAP ON MULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Purpose: The comprehensive general plan supports a housing ratio of
eighty three percent (83%) single-family residential to seventeen percent (17%)
multi-family residential ("the General Plan ratio"). Notwithstanding the
general plan, the city establishes a ratio of seventy seven percent (77%)
single-family residential to twenty three percent (23%) multi-family
residential for the purpose of this section.
   The City of West Jordan has adopted a cap and grade procedure to ensure the
orderly growth of the city and foster a housing mix that is consistent with the
general plan.
   B.   Exemptions: The following types of two-family and multi-family housing
are not subject to the annual cap or to the timing requirements of this
section:
      1.   Residential housing developments in compliance with the general plan
that are:

Zone (IOZ).
   C.   Selection Process: Each year on January 15, the city shall publicly
announce the number of multi-family housing units that are available to be
constructed based on the ratio set out in subsection A of this section. The
available cap will be determined each year based on the following mathematical
calculation:
      A minus B = the available number of units under the cap.
      A equals 29.87 percent of the total single-family residential units that
have received a building permit as of December 31 of the immediately preceding
year.
      B equals the total number of multi-family residential units (including
housing exempted by subsection B of this section) which have been constructed
or are under construction. For purposes of this section, "under construction"
means utilities such as sewer lines and storm drains are being installed.
      If there is an available number of units ("cap") announced, interested
applicants are invited to submit a proposed multi-family land use application
to the development services department during the next thirty (30) calendar
days using all or a part of the available cap. The planning commission, upon
recommendation of staff, shall judge the submitted proposed applications based
on the criteria contained in subsection D of this section and shall announce
the successful proposal(s) that, alone or together, will consume the available
cap (each a successful proposer) for the succeeding twelve (12) calendar
months.
      The city shall promptly notify the successful proposer(s) and the
nonsuccessful proposers of the decision within forty five (45) calendar days of
January 15.
      A successful proposer is required to promptly submit a complete
application package within sixty (60) calendar days of January 15, and to
diligently move the application process along to completion in response to
staff comments and requests. The intent with any successful proposer is that
the project is constructed or "under construction", as defined above, within
twelve (12) calendar months following January 15.
   D.   Application for Multi-Family Development Evaluation: Each application
for competitive evaluation of a multi-family development ("project") shall be
given a point rating pursuant to this section.
   E.   General Plan Compliance: Each application shall comply with the City of
West Jordan general plan as a prerequisite for the point rating evaluation.
   F.   Evaluation Criteria: The city shall calculate the total number of
points for the project based on the criteria in this section and provide a
written analysis justifying the expected number of points achieved. City staff
will forward all applications together with the total number of points achieved
for each project to the planning commission, together with a staff
recommendation, for a final decision. The planning commission shall determine
the successful proposer in the event of a tie through a flip of a coin in an
open hearing.

The nonconforming aspects of such lots, structures or uses shall be brought
into conformance with the requirements of this title as provided in this
chapter. The intent of this chapter is to recognize the interests of property
owners while controlling expansion of nonconforming lots, structures and uses.
   B.   No lot, structure, or use that complied with title 3 or title 10 of
this code in effect prior to May 2, 2000, shall become nonconforming due to
adoption of this title. Any lot, structure or use that complied with title 3 or
title 10 of this code in effect prior to May 2, 2000, may be rebuilt, repaired
or otherwise reestablished to the extent that it legally existed on May 2,
2000. Any lot, structure or use which was not authorized by or allowed under
preexisting zoning ordinances, as amended, or which is illegal under such
ordinance, shall remain unauthorized and illegal unless expressly authorized or
permitted in the provisions of this title. (2001 Code § 89-6-201)
13-9-2: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Continuation: A nonconforming use of any conforming structure, or a
nonconforming use of a nonconforming structure, may be continued as provided in
this chapter. A nonconforming use may be extended through the same structure,
provided no structural alteration of the structure is made for the purpose of
the extension. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period
of more than one year, any future use of such structure shall conform to the
provisions of the zone in which it is located.
   B.   Maintenance And Repair: Any structure that is part of a nonconforming
use protected under this chapter may be repaired or altered on the same terms
set forth for nonconforming structures under section
13-9-3 of this chapter.
   C.   Enlargement And Expansion: A nonconforming use may be expanded within
the floor area of an existing, conforming building or within an expanded
conforming building, subject to the limitations set forth in this section. In
any agricultural or residential zone, such expansion shall be permitted into an
area equal to the original floor area of the nonconforming use, subject to the
following requirements:
      1.   No new dwelling units shall be created.
      2.   Off street parking and loading required to serve the expansion area
shall be provided.
      3.   The board of adjustment shall review any expansion of a
nonconforming use that is greater than twenty five percent (25%) of the
original floor area. Before approving such expansion, the board of adjustment
shall find that the expansion is compatible with the neighborhood and not
detrimental to the community, as determined by the effect of the expansion on
traffic, value of adjacent and nearby properties, and the availability of
adequate public facilities and services.
   D.   Nonconforming Use Of Open Land: A nonconforming use of open land may be
continued, provided such nonconforming use shall not be expanded or extended
into any other portion of a conforming building or open land, and no
structures, additions, alterations or enlargements thereto shall be made,
except those required by law. If such nonconforming use is discontinued for a
continuous period of more than one year, any future use of the land shall
conform to the provisions of the zone in which it is located.
   E.   Expansion Of Outdoor Nonconforming Uses: A nonconforming use of a lot
where the principal use is not enclosed within a building, such as a salvage
yard or a motor vehicle sales lot, shall not be expanded, except in conformity
with the requirements of this title.
   F.   Nonconforming Residential And Agricultural Uses And Structures In
Nonresidential Zones: Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the
contrary, an application for a building permit to construct or repair an
accessory building or repair a primary residential structure, located on a lot
which is within a nonresidential zone may be approved if the structure meets
applicable building codes; the lot on which the structure is located has
historically been used for agricultural or residential purposes; and the
subject structure and use therein, whether defined as "primary" or "accessory",
is in conformity with similar structures and uses normally conducted within the
residential or agricultural zones. The proposed structure shall conform to the
height, size, setback and other requirements established for agricultural or
residential zones as though such requirements were actually incorporated within
the zone in which the structure is located.
   G.   Change In Use: A nonconforming use may be changed to a new use;
provided, that the new use shall be of the same general character or of a
character less intensive (and thus more closely conforming) than the existing,
nonconforming use. The initial determination of whether a proposed use is a
conforming use or is less intense shall be made by the zoning administrator. A
nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use or less intensive
nonconforming use, shall not thereafter be changed back to a less conforming
use than that to which it was changed. (2001 Code § 89-6-202)
13-9-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
   A.   Continuation: A nonconforming structure in any zone may be continued
for the period prescribed in this chapter, provided no additions or
enlargements are made thereto and no structural alterations are made therein,
except those required by law. If any such nonconforming structure is removed,
every future use of the lot on which the structure was located shall conform to
the provisions of this title.
   B.   Maintenance And Repair: Remodeling of a nonconforming structure within
the existing footprint thereof shall be permitted without a variance.
   C.   Enlargement And Expansion: Any expansion of a nonconforming structure
that increases the degree of nonconformance is prohibited, except as provided
in this section. Other expansions shall be permitted and shall not require a
variance.
      1.   The initial determination of whether a proposed expansion increases
the degree of nonconformity shall be made by the zoning administrator.
      2.   A structure which is nonconforming as to height, area or yard
regulations may be added to or enlarged upon authorization by the board of
adjustment; provided, that the board of adjustment, after a hearing, finds the
expansion to be compatible with the neighborhood and not detrimental to the
community, as determined by the effect of the expansion on traffic, value of
adjacent and nearby properties, and the availability of adequate public
facilities and services.
   D.   Relocation: If a nonconforming structure is relocated within the city,
it shall be placed only in a location where it fully conforms to the
requirements of this title.
   E.   Restoration: Any nonconforming structure that is damaged to the extent
of fifty percent (50%) or less of its fair market value by fire, wind, tornado,
earthquake, or other natural disaster, may be restored and the use of such
building may be continued. The structure shall not be rebuilt closer to the
property line than the original structure or the applicable setback lines,
whichever is closer. Any structure that is damaged to the extent of more than
fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value shall not be rebuilt, repaired or
used unless it conforms to all applicable requirements of this title.
   F.   Unsafe Structures: Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit
the continuing use of a structure found to be in violation of basic life safety
or health codes of the city. The right to continue use of a nonconforming
structure shall be subject to all applicable housing, building, health, and
other life safety codes of the city. (2001 Code § 89-6-203)
13-9-4: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   A.   Continuation: Lots or parcels of land that legally existed prior to
adoption of this title shall not be denied a building permit solely for reason
of nonconformance with the lot requirements of this title.
   B.   Vacant Lot: If the lot was vacant on the effective date hereof, then
the lot may be used as permitted by the zone in which the lot is located;
provided, that such use shall comply with applicable dimensional requirements
of this title. The owner may seek a variance from such requirements from the
board of adjustment.
   C.   Lot With Building Or Structure: If a lot contains a structure on the
effective date hereof, then the owner may continue the then existing use of
such structure and may expand the structure in any way that does not increase
the degree of nonconformity. An increase in building size shall not be deemed
to increase the degree of nonconformity unless it increases the encroachment on
a required setback. Remodeling of a structure within an existing footprint or
expansion in compliance with this section shall not require a variance, but
shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator as though the lot were
conforming.
   D.   Lot Merger: If a lot is smaller than required by this title and such
lot is at any time after the effective date hereof under common ownership with
an adjacent lot, then the two (2) shall be considered merged for purposes of
this title and shall in the future be considered together for purposes of
determining compliance. If merged lots contain sufficient area for a use, then
they shall be deemed fully conforming. If merged lots together do not contain
sufficient area for a use, they shall nonetheless be considered together for
purposes of reducing the degree of nonconformity. When a nonconforming lot has
been merged with another lot, such lot shall not again be used separately,
unless they are subdivided in accordance with the provisions of this title.
   E.   Nonconforming Lots Created By Public Action: When lot area or setbacks
are reduced as a result of conveyance to a federal, state or local government
for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least seventy five percent
(75%) of the required minimum lot size in the zone where it is located, the lot
shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot size and setback
standards of this title without resort to the board of adjustment. See section
13-8-10 of this title for related provisions. (2001 Code § 89-6-204)
13-9-5: OTHER NONCONFORMITIES:
   A.   Application: The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any other
circumstance which does not conform to the requirements of this title,
including, but not limited to, fence height or location; lack of buffers or
screening; lack of or inadequate landscaping; lack of or inadequate off street
parking; and any other matter not addressed by sections
13-9-2 through
13-9-4 of this chapter.
   B.   Nonconforming Development With Approved Site Plan: Nonconforming
development that is consistent with a site plan approved before the effective
date hereof shall be deemed to be in conformance with this title to the extent
that it is consistent with the approved site plan and to the extent that such
plan or conditions imposed thereon directly address the specific issue involved
in a determination of conformity. A nonconformity other than one of those
enumerated in sections
13-9-2 through
13-9-4 of this chapter shall be brought into conformance upon the occurrence of
any one of the following:
      1.   Any increase on the premises of more than thirty percent (30%) floor
area or fifty percent (50%) value.
      2.   For a property in a commercial or industrial zone, any change in use
to a more intensive use when a new certificate of occupancy is required.
   C.   Compliance: Because the nonconformities addressed in this section
involve less investment and are more easily corrected than those addressed in
sections
13-9-2 through
13-9-4 of this chapter, the policy of the city is to eliminate such
nonconformities as quickly as practicable. The extent of such nonconformities
shall not be increased. (2001 Code § 89-6-205)
13-9-6: ABANDONMENT:
   A.   Definition: A lot or structure containing a nonconforming use that is
not thus occupied or so used for a continuous period of one year, shall be
deemed abandoned and shall not thereafter be reoccupied or used except for a
use that conforms to the requirements of this title.
   B.   Presumption Of Abandonment: A nonconforming use shall be presumed
abandoned when any of the following occurs:
      1.   The owner has in writing or by public statement indicated intent to
abandon the use.
      2.   A less intensive use has replaced the original nonconforming use.
      3.   The structure has been removed through applicable procedures for the
condemnation of unsafe structures.
      4.   The owner has physically changed the structure or its permanent
equipment in such a way as to indicate a change in use or activity to something
other than the nonconforming use.
   C.   Overcoming Presumption Of Abandonment: A presumption of abandonment may
be rebutted upon a showing by the owner that during such period of time the
owner has done either of the following:
      1.   Maintained the lot and structure, if any, in accordance with the
building code.
      2.   Has been actively and continuously marketing the lot or structure
for sale or lease. (2001 Code § 89-6-207)
13-9-7: CHANGE IN NONCONFORMING STATUS:
A nonconforming lot, structure or use may not be changed, except in conformity
with the provisions of this title. Any nonconforming lot, structure or use
shall not, thereafter, be changed back to a previously existing conforming
building or use. (2001 Code § 89-6-208; amd. 2009 Code)
13-9-8: DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS:
In all cases, the property owner shall have the burden of establishing that a
nonconforming use or nonconforming structure lawfully exists under this title.
(2001 Code § 89-6-209)
13-9-9: NONCONFORMING USES DETRIMENTAL TO HEALTH AND SAFETY:
No provisions of this chapter shall be construed to allow the continuance of
any nonconforming structure or use when it is detrimental to the health, safety
and welfare of the public. (2001 Code § 89-6-210)
13-9-10: EXTENSION OF TIME FOR RECOVERY OF INVESTMENT:
   A.   Reason For Extension: The zoning administrator may grant an extension
of the time limits set forth in this chapter if the owner of a nonconforming
lot, structure or use demonstrates that before such time limit expires he will
be unlikely to recover or amortize the amount of his investment, if any, in the
nonconforming lot, structure or use.
   B.   Written Request For Extension Required: In order to secure an extension
of time, a property owner shall submit to the zoning administrator a written
request for an extension forty five (45) calendar days prior to the expiration
of the applicable time limit set forth in this chapter.
   C.   Required Information: The following information shall accompany an
extension request:
      1.   The amount of the owner's investment in the lot, structure or use
from the time it became nonconforming.
      2.   The amount of such investment that has been realized to date and an
estimate of the amounts that will be realized on the date the time limit
expires.
      3.   Evidence of any lease or purchase obligations undertaken in reliance
on any previously issued licenses or permits applying to the lot, structure or
use, including any contingency clauses in the license or permit permitting
termination of such lease.
   D.   Appeal: Any person aggrieved by a decision of the zoning administrator
may appeal such decision to the board of adjustment. (2001 Code § 89-6-211)
13-9-11: BILLBOARDS EXEMPT:
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to billboards. Nonconforming
billboards shall be terminated in accordance with applicable provisions of Utah
Code Annotated section 10-9a-512. (2001 Code § 89-6-212)
CHAPTER 10
URBAN DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION:
13-10-1: Purpose And Scope
13-10-2: Urban Design Principles
13-10-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish urban design parameters and
standards for all development within the city. (2001 Code § 89-6-301)
13-10-2: URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
   A.   Character And Condition Of City: These principles are based on a shared
understanding of the current character and condition of the city as follows:
      1.   The city reflects a diversity of architectural styles.
      2.   The city is a moderately sized city in the Salt Lake valley, with
the potential to become one of the three (3) largest cities in the state.
      3.   The city has been developed largely in small pieces occupying a
large land area. Despite its size, the separation of those pieces remains as a
barrier to the goals of community and a higher quality of life. The city should
seek to diminish these forces of separation in the form of the city by
fostering an attitude of neighborliness within the urban fabric. Each
development should enhance its neighborhood and relate to the city as a whole.
      4.   The city is currently oriented to vehicles that travel at an average
speed of thirty five (35) miles per hour in the city limits. New development
should foster the creation of environments with a priority for pedestrians. The
average pedestrian moves at about four (4) miles per hour and views (and uses)
the environment in a detailed fashion.
   B.   Context: Every development has a relationship to its setting. Positive
relations can be achieved by examining the next largest (and smallest) context
of the site. Ignoring the context can often assure poor relationships.
      1.   The size, character and setting of proposed projects should relate
to their specific contexts and functions of adjacent streets and pedestrian
networks. Buildings should be oriented to public rights of way as well as
additional internal circulation systems.
      2.   New development should incorporate building materials and technology
that are compatible with the arid setting and that are responsive to the
climate of this region.
   C.   Amenity/Comfort: Urban conditions such as paved areas and buildings
generating reflected heat create aridity and require mitigating design features
which enhance habitability.
      1.   Promote human comfort by providing shaded areas, courtyards,
colonnades, and other areas as site amenities.
      2.   Create developments for the ease of pedestrians both on and off the
site.
      3.   Promote the creation of public and semipublic places at both large
and small scales to encourage a sense of community.
      4.   Create a sense of place that respects nature and utilizes natural
and manmade materials and devices.
      5.   Encourage separation of pedestrians and automobiles.
      6.   Promote nighttime uses of sites with secure, well lighted amenity
zones and programmed activities.
   D.   Visual Interest: An environment that contains a harmonious balance of
various forms and materials can be visually interesting. Too much variety or
too much uniformity can lack visual interest. New development should seek to
preserve and enhance this basic human need.
      1.   Incorporate architectural and landscape elements at the pedestrian
level.
      2.   Maintain a pedestrian scale by creating variation of the urban form.
      3.   Recognize the interest created by both the repetition and changes in
various project patterns from window openings to paving designs.
      4.   Promote a diversity of architectural styles.
      5.   Integrate arts and crafts creatively into the built environment.
      6.   When a project occurs in a visually rich context, its form,
materials, orientation, and detailing should incorporate the assets offered by
its setting.
      7.   When a project occurs in a setting devoid of visual interest, it
should seek to provide a wide variety of forms and texture.
   E.   Activity: Environments that provide a variety of choices for people are
generally active settings for people to gather. This fosters a sense of
community when a visit can serve multiple needs in a setting that provides
safety, security and activity.
      1.   Encourage mixed use developments so as to provide increased
opportunities for informal and planned activities beyond the typical nine
o'clock (9:00) A.M. to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. work hours.
      2.   Promote design that will increase opportunities for activities both
within the project boundaries and between existing adjacent developments and
neighborhoods.
      3.   Where feasible, encourage design of single usage facilities to
accommodate retail and other uses at the pedestrian level to encourage activity
and use.
   F.   Clarity And Convenience: An environment that is easy to understand will
usually also be convenient for the people who use it. That is not to say
complexity must be avoided. Complexity can offer excitement, but not at the
expense of routine accessibility of the general public.
      1.   Environments should be created that are understandable and help
orient the user and the general public.
      2.   Developments should be convenient to and accessible by persons with
physical limitations and disabilities.
      3.   Developments should derive their basic order from the underlying
geometry of city streets and the north/south, east/west orientation it implies.
This will assist the ready comprehensibility of the city. Individual projects
should relate to existing streets and canals, except where creative design
establishes a more successful relationship to new streets, pedestrian walkways
or major open spaces.
      4.   Sites should be planned to respect existing natural and manmade
landmarks and to create landmarks for the ease of public recognition.
      5.   Protect major vistas and panoramas that give special emphasis to
open space and mountains.
      6.   Design project signage and environmental graphics at a scale that
provides clarity to the pedestrian as well as the automobile and does not
result in visual clutter.
   G.   Character/Distinctiveness: Every project should strive to enhance the
unique character of its neighborhood. Without limiting the creative
opportunities for the specific project, the development should help make its
neighborhood more distinctive.
      1.   Each development should contribute to the character identified for
each project and the specific character for neighborhoods within each project.
      2.   Promote neighborhood identity by planning elements that reinforce
the landscape and built character of the area.
      3.   The character and environments should be designed at a human scale
as well as within its neighborhood identity.
   H.   Definition Of Space: Streets, parking lots, buildings and landscape are
the major elements that define the special qualities of our environment.
Organize them to foster a setting supportive to the pedestrian as well as the
driver.
      1.   Relate the size, character and setting of proposed projects to the
functions of adjacent streets and pedestrian networks. Buildings should be
oriented to the public rights of way and close to pedestrian movement.
      2.   The areas immediately adjacent to buildings should be designed to
integrate with surrounding landscape and pedestrian walkways. Shaded
courtyards, cloisters, trellises, colonnades and public art are encouraged for
consideration into the design to define space.
      3.   In an effort to create safe pedestrian walkways on highly traveled
public rights of way, a buffer area should separate the sidewalk from the
street curb.
      4.   On street parking should be encouraged in village core business
areas to further protect the pedestrian zone from vehicular traffic.
   I.   Views: City dwellers and visitors alike appreciate being reminded of
the beauty of their environment. Protecting views of the environment assist in
fostering appreciation of our environment, as well as allowing the environment
to aid in orienting people spatially within the city.
      1.   Protect major vistas and panoramas that give special emphasis to
open space, mountains and special manmade or natural landmarks.
      2.   Promote the creation of views both from within a project and from
the adjacent streets and neighborhoods into the project. Consider the access to
views of both the project users and the general public.
      3.   Create opportunities for incorporating individual projects into the
patterns and sequence of views that exist within an area, neighborhood or urban
village.
      4.   Limit the use of sound walls or fences over eight feet (8') in
height that diminish view corridors.
   J.   Variety/Contrast: Variety of site and building design helps to create
interest within an urban area. Coupled with attention to creating environments
for human activities, such variety fosters goals of creating identifiable
neighborhoods and of encouraging creative development.
      1.   Promote variety and diversity of building and site design within a
context of urban and architectural continuity.
      2.   Create environments that encourage a number of specific activities
fronting the street, court or plaza at ground level to provide variety at a
human scale.
   K.   Scale And Pattern: Ultimately, all developments must relate to the
human scale. Patterns help humanize development.
      1.   A large structure should contain elements which transition to the
human scale, particularly near the ground.
      2.   If a development is larger (or smaller) than its adjacent physical
context, the design should provide transitional elements at the perimeter to
integrate it with its surroundings.
      3.   The variation of scale, pattern and texture of building and
landscaping elements is encouraged to create a more visually interesting
project. The variety should be readable at the pedestrian scale as well as from
a distance (skyline).
      4.   The proportion between the height of a building and the width of the
street and setback determine the basic urban form. If the intent of the design
is urban in character, the height should be greater and the setback less.
      5.   Buildings should be designed to reveal or express their primary
patterns of use and entry. This will not only assist comprehensibility, but
also achieve a desirable variety. (2001 Code § 89-6-302)

expected to come to an establishment at any time under normal conditions for
any purpose, whether as patrons, customers, guests, employees or otherwise. The

chapter is also intended to result in easily accessed parking areas that are
attractively landscaped to improve their appearance and to avoid negative
environmental impacts associated with large areas of paved surfaces.

except where the city has established permanent parking areas or facilities for
a community purpose or where the city has specifically provided for alternative
parking requirements or restrictions for a particular zone or overlay district.
   B.   Continued Obligation To Provide Parking Spaces: Compliance with this
chapter is a continuing obligation so long as the use continues. It shall be
unlawful for any owner of any building or for any person responsible for
providing parking to discontinue or dispense with required parking facilities
without providing some other vehicle parking area which meets the requirement
of this chapter.
   C.   Nonconforming Parking Facilities: Any use of property which on the
effective date of this title, or of any subsequent amendment thereto, is
nonconforming only as to the regulations relating to off street parking
facilities may continue in the same manner as if the parking facilities were
conforming. Such existing parking facilities shall not be further reduced. Any
reconstruction, alteration or other change in use shall be subject to the
provisions of this chapter. (2001 Code § 89-6-602; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 10-20,

      1.   Except for parking within a TSOD or as permitted below as off site
parking, all required parking shall be located on the same parcel of land with
the use to which it is appurtenant or on common areas in the same development.
Parking lots or structures shall be located at the rear or sides of buildings
whenever possible. All parking lots and structures shall be substantially
screened from adjacent streets and neighboring lots. Landscaping, fences,
designed berms, walls, screening structures, or a combination of these, can be
used to provide the needed screening. All required screening shall be provided
on site. Screening shall be a minimum of three feet (3') in height when

where screening shall not exceed two feet (2') in height.
      2.   Parking lot screening that is only provided by landscape planting
shall be of a material capable of providing a solid visual barrier within two
(2) years of the time of planting. Species, installation sizes and irrigation
systems will be evaluated for conformance with this requirement prior to final
approval of the landscape plan.
   B.   Off Site: Where there are practical difficulties in providing on site
parking or if public safety or convenience, or both, would be better served by
locating parking on an alternative site, the Zoning Administrator may authorize
an off site location subject to the following conditions:
      1.   The parking spaces are located on land in the same ownership as that
of the land on which the use is located.
      2.   A pedestrian entrance to the land use that the parking will serve is
located within six hundred feet (600') of the parking space, by the shortest
route of effective pedestrian access.
      3.   The off site parking shall be conveniently usable without causing:
         a.   Hazard to pedestrians;
         b.   Hazard to vehicular traffic;
         c.   Traffic congestion;
         d.   Interference with safe and convenient access to other parking
areas in the vicinity;
         e.   Detriment to the appropriate use of business property in the
vicinity; and
         f.   Detriment to any residential neighborhood.
   C.   Joint, Common Or Shared Use: Common or shared use of parking facilities
is permitted, provided the following are met:
      1.   The shared parking area is contiguous to the property of the land
uses it will serve;
      2.   The joint use of such facilities is assured by the recording of
covenants; and
      3.   Either of the following conditions apply:
         a.   The total of all parking spaces when used together, shall not be
less than the sum of the various uses computed separately; or
         b.   The shared parking facilities allow for separate daytime/
nighttime uses.

20, 7-28-2010; Ord. 18-35, 11-7-2018)
13-12-6: PARKING LOT AND RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAY DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Parking Plans: Plans for any proposed parking area shall be submitted
to the development services department at the time of application for site plan
approval. If the project does not require site plan approval, the parking plan
shall be submitted with an application for a building permit. The plan shall
clearly indicate the proposed development, including location, size, shape,
design, curb cuts, lighting, landscaping and other features of the proposed
development.
   B.   Driveway Access To Public Street: Every required parking area shall
have unencumbered driveway access to a public street. Such access shall be
through platted or recorded easements, reciprocal arrangements or other
guaranteed means.

driveways accessing a public road shall be located a minimum of fifty feet
(50') from other driveways or streets. One-way driveways shall have a minimum
width of twelve feet (12'). Two-way driveways and all driveways on developments
of one acre or larger in size shall have minimum widths of twenty feet (20').
      2.   Unless approved by the Planning Commission, parking lots shall not
directly access arterial or collector streets but shall access such streets by
way of an internal roadway system designed and constructed to City standards.
      3.   Nonresidential traffic on local streets should be minimized and
directed out of neighborhoods. Parking lot access for nonresidential uses shall
not be permitted from local or collector streets if adequate access is
available to major streets.
   C.   Parking Lot Materials And Drainage:
      1.   In all zones except in agricultural, rural residential zones and
single family residential zones as required by subsection
13-12-5E1 of this chapter, every lot or parcel used as a public or private
parking area required by section
13-12-2 of this chapter shall be paved with asphalt or concrete and maintained
to eliminate dust or mud.
      2.   Parking areas and driveways in agricultural and rural residential
zones may have either paved or graveled surfaces.
      3.   Parking lots shall be graded and drained to dispose of all surface
water. Surface water drainage shall not be permitted to cross a public
sidewalk.
      4.   Concrete curb walls shall be provided at the perimeter of all
permanent parking lots, around interior parking lot landscaping, and at the
edges of driveways.
   D.   Parking Structures: Multilevel or basement parking facilities may be
used; provided, that parking structures are treated as buildings for purposes
of yard, lot, building, landscaping and other requirements of this chapter.
   E.   Lighting: Any lights used to illuminate a parking lot shall be arranged
to reflect the light away from adjoining lots in all zones. Lights shall also
be shielded to reduce or eliminate uplighting. Parking lot and security
lighting shall not exceed a maximum of fifteen feet (15') in height, including
lamp, pole and base, within one hundred fifty feet (150') of a residential
district. Parking lot and security lighting should not exceed a maximum of
twenty five feet (25') in height in nonresidential districts, except in SC-
2 and SC-3 Commercial Zones, where such lighting shall not exceed forty two
feet (42') in height. All light levels shall not exceed one foot-candle power
at the property line.
   F.   Pedestrian Safety: To the maximum extent possible, pedestrians shall be
separated from vehicles and bicycles. Where complete separation of pedestrians
and vehicles and bicycles is not possible, potential hazards shall be minimized
by the use of techniques such as special paving, grade separations, pavement
marking, signs or striping, bollards, median refuge areas, traffic calming
features, landscaping, lighting, or other means to clearly delineate pedestrian
areas, for both day and night use.
      1.   Parking plans shall include site amenities that enhance safety and
convenience and promote walking or bicycling as an alternative means of
transportation. Site amenities may include bike racks, drinking fountains,
canopies and benches as described in the City bicycle and pedestrian plan.
      2.   Walkways shall link street sidewalks with building entries through
parking lots. Such walkways shall be grade separated from the parking lot with
a paved surface not less than six feet (6') wide.
      3.   Where necessary for primary pedestrian access to cross drive aisles
or internal roadways, the pedestrian crossing shall emphasize and place
priority on pedestrian access and safety. The material and layout of the
pedestrian access shall be continuous as it crosses the driveway. Any breaks in
continuity shall be in the driveway paving and not in the pedestrian accessway.
The pedestrian crossings must be well marked using pavement treatments, signs
and landscaping.
   G.   Bicycle Facilities: Commercial, civic, employment and multi-family
residential uses shall provide bicycle facilities meeting the following
standards:
      1.   Bicycle parking spaces, equal to five percent (5%) of vehicular
parking spaces, shall be provided in all developments.
      2.   For convenience and security, bicycle parking facilities shall be
located near building entrances and shall be visible from the land uses they
serve. However, such facilities shall not impede pedestrian or automobile
traffic flow or cause damage to plant material from bicycle traffic.
      3.   Bicycle parking racks shall be designed to allow the bicycle frame
and both wheels to be securely locked to the rack. The rack shall be of
permanent construction, such as heavy gauge tubular steel with angle bars
permanently attached to the pavement foundation. Bicycle parking areas shall be
at least two feet (2') wide and five and one-half feet (51/2') long, with
additional back out or maneuvering space of at least five feet (5').
   H.   Urban Design Standards For Parking Lots:
      1.   Parking lots shall be buffered from adjacent residential properties
and screened from streets so that cars are not visible below the average height
of the headlights.
      2.   Access drives, internal circulation drives, parking areas and
pedestrian walkways shall be designed to provide safety and convenience for
both motorists and pedestrians and to ensure access for the physically
disabled.
      3.   For office and retail commercial projects, every parking space shall
be no greater than one hundred fifty feet (150') from a sidewalk leading to the
building or from a building entrance, and a shade tree shall be placed every
thirty feet (30') along the walkway except at driveway crossings.
      4.   Saving mature landscaping enhances street character. With the
exception of safety considerations, location of driveway curb cuts for parking
lots shall not cause the removal of mature landscaping.
      5.   Joint use of parking is encouraged in order to reduce trips. Access
to and the location of new parking areas shall relate to adopted area plans,
planned parking in the area, or to existing area parking schemes.
      6.   The number of curb cuts shall be minimized and pedestrian access
enhanced. Surface parking design shall utilize shared access drives with
adjacent, similarly zoned properties to reduce interference with pedestrians.
      7.   Parking facilities exist for many years and must integrate with the
future surrounding uses. Parking lot design shall consider future planned and
existing uses of adjacent sites. (2001 Code § 89-6-606; amd. 2009 Code; Ord.
10-20, 7-28-2010; Ord. 13-17, 4-24-2013)

overhang area, the modules above can be reduced by two feet (2') for each side
of overhang.
         b.   For each one inch (1") of additional stall width, the module may
be reduced three inches (3") to maintain the same level of comfort.
         c.   If parking structures are used, the modules may be modified to
match the most current Urban Land Institute (ULI) parking standards for
structured parking. Type of use based on vehicle turnover shall be determined
by the Zoning Administrator. Compact stalls under the standard minimum lengths
and widths may be considered only in such situations where structural
impediments create unique hardships; such hardships shall be determined and
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Approved compact stalls shall be clearly
marked.

FENCING AND SCREENING
SECTION:
13-14-1: Purpose
13-14-2: Fencing Required Between Incompatible Uses
13-14-3: General Provisions And Regulations
13-14-4: Regulations For Specific Zoning Districts
13-14-5: Prohibited Fencing Materials
13-14-6: Fences/Walls On Sloped Properties
13-14-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate fencing requirements for all zoning
districts, including the location, height and type of fence required. (2001
Code § 89-6-801)
13-14-2: FENCING REQUIRED BETWEEN INCOMPATIBLE USES:
   A.   The developer shall install a permanent fence, not less than six feet
(6') high, of a type approved by the planning commission along all boundaries
with properties adjacent to developments where existing adjacent uses are found
by the planning commission or by the zoning administrator to either represent a
potential safety hazard or to be less intensive than the use proposed.
   B.   For purposes of this section, uses that may represent a potential
safety hazard include, but are not limited to, agricultural, major streets,
railroad tracks or open waterways.
   C.   Determinations concerning the relative intensity of one use compared to
another, adjacent use shall be made by the zoning administrator. (2001 Code §
89-6-802; amd. 2009 Code)
13-14-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS AND REGULATIONS:
   A.   Rule Of Construction: The terms "walls" and "fences" may also include
hedges, berms or similar unroofed landscape features.
   B.   Screening Of Outside Storage And Operation Areas:
      1.   A masonry wall or solid metal fencing shall be required to screen
outside storage and operation areas from public streets.
      2.   A chainlink fence with slats or other opaque fence or wall shall be
required along side and rear property lines to screen areas of outside storage
and operations up to and including the gate.
      3.   Fences used to screen outside storage and operations areas shall be
not less than six feet (6') high. Fences greater than eight feet (8') high may
be approved by the planning commission upon a finding that increased height for
screening is necessary to reduce impacts on surrounding properties.
      4.   Materials within twenty feet (20') of the fence may not be stored
higher than the fence.
   C.   Screening Of Dumpsters, Utility Equipment And Service/Loading Areas:
All building mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened with integrated
architectural features. All utility and mechanical equipment, dumpsters,
loading areas and other utility areas commonly found outdoors shall be
constructed below the natural grade and/or completely screened with masonry
fencing, with solid metal gates and landscaping, unless other materials of
sufficient durability are determined by the planning commission to be more
compatible with the associated development. Loading areas for delivery or
freight vehicles shall be designed to provide sufficient area for the vehicles
to be completely screened from public view during the loading and unloading
process. Exception: If the doors are in view of the street, they shall be
screened with trees and shrubs; or have a combination of decorative design
elements; as reviewed by the design review committee and as approved by the
planning commission. Building loading areas which face a front or corner side
yard are only allowed in the M-1, M-2 and C-M zoning districts and may be
approved by the planning commission upon a finding that the loading area is
adequately screened from public view with landscaping. Additional landscaping
shall be installed over and above the minimum zoning requirements to
sufficiently screen loading areas from public view as determined by the
planning commission. In the M-1, M-2 and C-M zoning districts, bay doors no
greater than eight feet (8') high and four feet (4') wide may be permitted on a
building facing a front or corner side yard without screening if the doors are
architecturally integrated into the facade of the building.
   D.   Waterways, Canals And Ditches: All open waterways, canals and ditches
shall be either piped or fenced with a six foot (6') fence. The planning
commission or zoning administrator shall approve the fencing material, which
may include wrought iron fencing. If the city engineer determines that natural
waterways or established parkways have a limited or intermittent flow which
poses no undue hazard to normal human activity, then the natural waterway or
established parkway may be exempted from this requirement.
   E.   Wall/Fencing Between Uses Of Different Intensities: Where a new
development is determined to be more intensive than an existing use on adjacent
property which has a different zoning designation, the planning commission or
zoning administrator shall require one of the following:
      1.   A masonry wall;
      2.   A decorative concrete wall that is comparable to or exceeds the
durability, performance, and appearance of a masonry wall;
      3.   An opaque fence of other durable material as approved by the
planning commission or zoning administrator; or
      4.   A satisfactory landscaped buffer or open space that includes
berming, trees and hedges to adequately buffer the conflicting uses.
   F.   Temporary Construction Fencing: Temporary construction fencing shall be
installed along appropriate boundaries as recommended by the zoning
administrator. Temporary fencing shall be installed prior to the issuance of
any building permit where required to contain blowing refuse. The construction
fence shall remain in place until the final bond release or until ninety
percent (90%) of the development is completed. The construction fence shall be
chainlink.
   G.   Streetscape Walls: Unless otherwise approved by the planning commission
or city council, a minimum six foot (6') high opaque masonry or lightweight
precast fiber reinforced concrete wall shall be constructed along the inside
edge of the sidewalk in the street right of way or in the back of a landscaped
area along other public streets, corridors or trail rights of way, or where
residential subdivisions abut arterial or collector streets. Masonry walls
shall be constructed with masonry pillars at twenty foot (20') intervals that
extend at least three inches (3") from the surface of the wall panels. A
precast concrete cap shall be placed on the top of each pillar. The wall shall
be constructed to prevent weed growth between the sidewalk and the wall. A mow
strip shall be installed between the wall pillars to inhibit weed growth. A
permanent, nonporous sealer, approved by the city engineer, shall be applied to
the street side surfaces of masonry walls to facilitate cleaning.
      1.   Exceptions To Masonry Wall Requirement:
         a.   The planning commission or city council may approve continuing a
theme and/or color of a residential right of way fence/wall to match an
adjoining fence/wall that has been previously approved.
         b.   The planning commission may approve a decorative concrete wall if
it is demonstrated that the construction is comparable to or exceeds the
durability, performance and appearance of a masonry wall.
         c.   After receiving a recommendation from the urban forester, the
planning commission may approve a specific streetscape design which includes a
nonmasonry wall, trees, shrubs and other suitable landscaping materials.
      2.   Maintenance: Upon completion of a permanent wall/fence by the
developer and acceptance by the city, the abutting property owners shall assume
full responsibility for its maintenance and shall not hold the city responsible
for defects of workmanship, maintenance, repair or liabilities of any nature
arising from the construction or intended use of said wall/fence. (2001 Code §

   C.   General Regulations:
      1.   Collocation Potential: A condition of approval may include a
requirement that the structure be designed and engineered to reasonably allow
collocation by subsequent providers of low power radio communication services,
if collocation is feasible and consistent with sound engineering principles.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to deny the owner of such a
structure from the right to receive reasonable compensation from the subsequent
collocating providers for the use of the structure.
      2.   Accessory Buildings: Accessory buildings to monopoles or stealth
poles must comply with the required setback, height and other applicable
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located.
      3.   Fencing: With the exception of stealth poles, monopoles shall be

which new developments within the city are reviewed, approved, permitted and
amended. This title is intended to give a brief outline of the development
review procedures.
   B.   Development Processes Manual: The zoning administrator is authorized to
develop and promulgate a development processes manual to assist city staff and
developers in the processing of land development applications. In the event a
provision of a development processes manual materially conflicts with the
provisions of this title or of its related titles (titles 11, 12, 13 and 14 of
this code), the provisions of these titles will control. Details on the
individual processes for each review process type of property development
application can be found within the development processes manual.
   C.   Application: This title shall govern the development process for the
following types of property development:
      1.   Site plans for multiple-unit and multiple-family residential,
commercial, office, industrial and institutional projects, including
condominium developments and conversions.
      2.   Other property development types, including planned residential
developments and planned communities.
      3.   Use permits, including those for conditional uses, temporary uses,
land disturbance, building permits and special exceptions.

line adjustments and condominiums.
      5.   Development plan permits.
      6.   Variances. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 19-52, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12
noon on January 6, 2020)
15-1-2: SCOPE:
This title shall apply to all property within the corporate limits of the city
that seek to alter its condition or use by development, subdivision or other
change that requires a permit under this code, or any other ordinance or law,
except such property expressly exempted therefrom by the provisions of this
title or other lawful exemption. Unless another department has primary
responsibility for processing a permit, the zoning administrator, or his or her
designee, shall administer these provisions and may adopt such rules as will
assist in administering these provisions. The process may be varied or altered
by the zoning administrator or the planning commission as allowed within this
title. (2009 Code)
15-1-3: ACTIONS EXEMPT FROM PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS:
Unless otherwise provided by law, nothing contained in this title shall be
construed as giving the city jurisdiction over properties owned by the state or
the United States. When state or federal law requires compliance with local
regulations, this section shall not be construed to abrogate such requirement.
(2009 Code)
15-1-4: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases used in this title shall have the following
meanings, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:
CONJUNCTIONS: Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary,
conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows:
   A.   "And" indicates that all connected items, conditions, provisions or
events shall apply.
   B.   "Or" indicates that one or more of the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events shall apply.
   C.   "Either"..."or" indicates that the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events shall apply singly, but not in combination.

in relation to a proposed development.
COURT: A court of original jurisdiction, district court or appeals court.
DAYS: Measured in calendar days, unless otherwise specified.
|NOTICE: A signed letter or other written notice.
REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME: A time frame dependent on the magnitude and
complexity of a project, relating to the review process type for each type of
application.
WRITTEN REQUEST: A signed letter to the city, which may be electronically
delivered. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 19-52, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on
January 6, 2020)
15-1-5: CONSISTENCY:
   A.   Review Process Will Address Consistency: The project review process
type shall address consistency between a proposed project and the applicable
regulations or plan.
   B.   Determining Consistency: Consistency should be determined through a
review process type that integrates land use and environmental review. This
review process type shall consider four (4) factors found in applicable
regulations or plans:
      1.   The type of land use allowed;
      2.   The level of development allowed, such as units per acre or other
measures of density;
      3.   Infrastructure, such as the adequacy of public facilities and
services to serve the proposed project; and
      4.   The character of the proposed development, such as compliance with
specific development standards.
   C.   Method: The city intends that this approach should be largely a matter
of checking compliance with existing requirements for most projects, which are
simple or routine, while more complex projects require more analysis. (2009
Code)
15-1-6: INACTIVE APPLICATIONS:
All applications for property development and/or use permits shall be actively
pursued to a final decision by the city. If no activity has occurred on an
application for one hundred eighty (180) days from the submittal date, the
application will be deemed as inactive and the file closed. The applicant may
submit a written request to maintain the application as active, wherein upon
finding that there is good cause and reasonable belief that the application
will be pursued to completion, the zoning administrator may grant a one-time
ninety (90) day extension. (Ord. 11-35, 11-22-2011; amd. Ord. 19-52, 12-11-

15-3-1: OVERVIEW OF REVIEW PROCESS:
   A.   Description of Process: This section describes, in general terms, the
process by which new development requests shall be reviewed by the City. The
process may be varied or altered by the city planner or the planning commission
as allowed within this title.
   B.   Preapplication Conference: The developer contacts the development
services department to be placed on the agenda for the weekly preapplication
conference. The purposes of that conference are:
      1.   To allow the developer to present a sketch plan and/or to describe
the general nature of the proposed development;
      2.   To better facilitate the development process by establishing initial
contacts between the city staff (principally the planning, engineering and fire
chief or designee offices) and the developer;
      3.   To clarify city requirements in order to eliminate unnecessary
delays or hardships to the proposed development; and
      4.   To allow the zoning administrator to determine if the development
request is for:
         a.   A general plan land use map amendment (other than one which
apparently conforms to and is apparently consistent with the current zoning
map); and/or
         b.   The rezoning of property (a zoning map amendment) which
apparently does not conform to and is apparently not consistent with the
purposes, goals, objectives and policies of the adopted general plan and/or
land use map.
   C.   Determination of Required Applications, Including Map Amendment
Applications: The development services department determines and informs the
developer which type of development applications will be necessary for the
review of the proposed project (see subsections D through I of this section for
specific types of developments and application requirements). If the proposed
development requires:
      1.   A general plan land use map or general plan text amendment, then the
procedures outlined in title 13, chapter 7, article C of this Code shall be
followed; and
      2.   The rezoning of property (a zoning map amendment) or a text
amendment of city ordinances, then the procedures outlined in title 13, chapter
7, article D of this Code shall be followed.
   D.   Submittal of Application: The procedure for submitting an application
is as follows:
      1.   The developer submits a completed application form and other
required information. One application form may be used when several different
reviews are to take place at the same time; however, a separate application is
required for any subsequent review.
      2.   The development services department processes the application and
distributes copies of the submittals to other city departments. If planning
commission review is required, the project may be scheduled on the next
available planning commission agenda at the discretion of the city planner
after consultation with the chair of the planning commission. If the
application is an uncontested, routine land use matter, upon a complete
application and proper notice, it may receive informal streamlined review and
action by the planning staff with the approval by the city planner and city
engineer. Reviews and approvals required by other departments must be completed
prior to an application being scheduled on a planning commission agenda. The
staff shall not approve a final site plan or final plat until other departments
and agencies have approved construction plans.
      3.   The city planner or the planning commission may require that a
developer schedule a neighborhood meeting to discuss the proposal with
surrounding property owners if the development appears large in scale or
controversial.
   E.   Action on Application: Following review of the application by the
appropriate reviewing body, one of the following actions will be taken:
      1.   Approval of the request as presented;
      2.   Approval of a modification to the request;
      3.   Postponement of a determination where further information or input
is deemed to be necessary; or
      4.   Denial of the request.
   F.   Final Staff Review: Following an action of final approval, the
developer shall submit any additional information or make any additional
corrections as required by city ordinances and/or conditions of approval. City
staff will then complete final review and approval of the proposed development.
The following actions, if not completed earlier, may then take place:
      1.   Execute any required development letter;
      2.   Submit an executed improvement guarantee; and
      3.   Pay appropriate impact fees.
   G.   Submittal of Application and Plans for Building Permit: An application
for a building permit is submitted with building plans. The building plans are
then reviewed by city staff for compliance with all appropriate laws,
ordinances, regulations and any related condition of approval.
   H.   Issuance of Building Permit: Upon approval of the building plans, and
after receiving acceptable evidence from the finance department that all: 1)
building permit; 2) application and review; and 3) impact fees have been paid
in full, the city may issue and deliver the requested building permit.
   I.   Preconstruction Conference: After plans are approved and inspection
fees paid, but prior to commencement of development of any subdivision or the
construction of any multi-unit residential, commercial, industrial, office or
institutional building, a preconstruction conference shall be held between city
staff and the developer, the general contractor and major subcontractors. (2001
Code § 89-5-102; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 17-41, 7-12-2017; Ord. 19-52, 12-11-2019,
Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
15-3-2: OPTIONAL CONCEPT PLAN MEETING:
The developer may contact the development services department to schedule an
optional concept plan meeting, and to pay any fees associated with such a
meeting. At this meeting, the developer will provide a sketch plan and/or
describe the general nature of the proposed development. The purpose of the
concept plan meeting is to better facilitate the development process by
establishing initial contacts between the city staff and the developer, as well
as seeking to clarify city requirements in order to eliminate unnecessary
delays to the proposed development. Concept plan meetings are strongly
encouraged for projects which are large in scale or otherwise complex in
nature. The development services department will assist the developer to
determine which type of development applications will be necessary for the
review of the proposed project. (See the staff development processes manual for
specific application requirements.) If the proposed development requires the
rezoning of property or an amendment of city ordinances, the requirements of
title 13, chapter 7, article D of this code shall be followed. (2009 Code; amd.
Ord. 19-52, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
15-3-3: PROJECT PERMIT APPLICATION:
The procedure for submitting an application is as follows:
   A.   Filing Application: The developer shall schedule a submittal meeting
with the development services department where they will submit a completed
application form and other required information. One application form may be
used when several different reviews are to take place at the same time;
however, a separate application is required for any subsequent review.
   B.   City Staff Processing: The development services department processes
the application and distributes copies of the submittals to other city
departments. If planning commission review is required, the project may be
scheduled on the next available planning commission agenda at the discretion of
the city planner. If the application is an uncontested review process Type I
land use matter, upon a complete application and proper notice, it may receive
informal streamlined review and action by city staff with approval by the city
planner and city engineer. Reviews and approvals required by other departments
must be completed prior to an application being scheduled on a planning
commission agenda. The staff shall not approve a final site plan or final plat
until other departments and agencies have approved construction plans.
   C.   Neighborhood Meeting: The city planner or the planning commission may
require that a developer schedule a neighborhood meeting to discuss the
proposal with surrounding property owners if the development appears large in
scale or controversial. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 19-52, 12-11-2019, Effective at
12 noon on January 6, 2020)
15-3-4: DETERMINATION OF COMPLETE APPLICATION:
   A.   No Review Without Complete Application: A complete application will be
required prior to the development services department accepting the application
for city staff review.
   B.   Completeness Determined: Completeness shall be determined by the
development services department during the prescheduled submittal meeting (see
subsection
15-3-3B of this chapter). The criteria for completeness can be found for each
application type within checklists, as outlined in the development processes
manual. (2009 Code; amd. Ord. 19-52, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on
January 6, 2020)
15-3-5: PROJECT OWNERSHIP AT TIME OF APPLICATION:
All property subject to a master development plan review shall be in single
entity or corporate ownership at the time of application, or the subject of an
application filed jointly by all owners of the property. (2009 Code; amd. Ord.
19-52, 12-11-2019, Effective at 12 noon on January 6, 2020)
15-3-6: INTEGRATED (CONCURRENT APPLICATION) PERMIT PROCESS:
For projects which require multiple types of application approvals, a
procedural review and decision on the various application approvals may be made
by the appropriate approval bodies concurrently to the extent permitted by
applicable code provisions, including, but not limited to, this title. This
concurrent application permit process is at the option of the applicant, and
should be used only in situations when the developer does not perceive a risk
of conflicting decisions by the different approval bodies on the different
application approvals of the concurrent application.
   A.   Ranking of Application; Zoning Administrator May Deny Concurrent
Processing: An application that involves multiple review procedures may be
processed concurrently beginning with the highest numbered review process type
required for the proposed project, unless the applicant requests that each
application be processed individually. Based on the content and complexity of
the application, the zoning administrator may grant or deny any request to
process multiple applications concurrently.
   B.   Consolidated Notice: For all projects which require multiple
application approvals, the zoning administrator shall prepare a single
consolidated notice or multiple notices as necessary. Staff review analysis may
be contained in consolidated or separate reports. A decision shall be made for
each application based on the criteria and findings for each action.
   C.   Joint Hearing: Applications may be processed concurrently so long as a
joint hearing can be held within the time periods specified in this title or
the applicant consents to a later schedule date in the event that additional
time is needed in order to combine the hearings.
   D.   Coordination with Other Agencies: The zoning administrator shall
coordinate with other agencies, departments and divisions of the city in order
to hold a joint hearing; provided, that:
      1.   The city is not expressly prohibited by its own code or state
statute from doing so.
      2.   Sufficient notice of the hearing is given to meet each specific
process's noticing requirements as set forth in this title or state statute.
      3.   All necessary and required application information has been supplied
by the applicant for each required process.
      4.   The zoning administrator deems that the concurrent process and/or

Jordan City Code. It may be cited and pleaded under either designation. (Ord.
18-31, 9-11-2018)
16-1A-2: DECLARATION OF PURPOSE:
The City Council of the City of West Jordan finds that the enforcement of this
Code and applicable State codes throughout the City is an important public
service. Code enforcement is vital to the protection of the public's health,
safety, and quality of life. The City Council recognizes that enforcement
starts with the drafting of precise regulations that can be effectively applied
in administrative code enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. The City
Council further finds that a comprehensive code enforcement system that uses a
combination of judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain
compliance with these regulations. Failure to comply with an administrative
code enforcement action may require the City Attorney to file a judicial action
to gain compliance. (Ord. 18-31, 9-11-2018)
16-1A-3: SCOPE:
The provisions of this title may be applied to all violations of this Code. It

compliance of its ordinances. (Ord. 18-31, 9-11-2018)
16-1A-4: EXISTING LAW CONTINUED:
The provisions of this title do not invalidate any other title or ordinance,
but shall be read in conjunction with those titles and ordinances as an
additional remedy available for enforcement of those ordinances. (Ord. 18-31,
9-11-2018)
16-1A-5: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION RIGHT:
The City has sole discretion in deciding whether to file a civil or criminal
case for the violation of any of its ordinances. The City may choose to file
both, or one or the other. The enactment of this administrative remedy shall in
no way interfere with the City's right to prosecute City ordinance violations
as criminal offenses. The City may use any of the remedies available under the
law in both civil and criminal prosecution. If the City chooses to file both
civil and criminal charges for the same day of violation, no civil penalties
may be assessed, but all other remedies are available. (Ord. 18-31, 9-11-2018)
16-1A-6: EFFECT OF HEADING:
Title, chapter, article and section headings contained herein shall not be
deemed to govern, limit, modify, or in any manner affect the scope, meaning, or
intent of the provisions of any title, chapter, article, or section hereof.
(Ord. 18-31, 9-11-2018)

decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions of this title. The City Council of this
City hereby declares that it would have adopted this title and each section,
subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision thereof,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, clauses,
phrases, portions, or provisions be declared invalid or unconstitutional. This
section shall apply to all amendments heretofore or hereafter made to this
title. (Ord. 18-31, 9-11-2018)
16-1A-8: NO MANDATORY DUTY - CIVIL LIABILITY:
It is the intent of the City Council that in establishing performance standards
or establishing an obligation to act by a City officer or employee, these
standards shall not be construed as creating a mandatory duty for purposes of
tort liability if the officer or employee fails to perform his or her directed
duty or duties. (Ord. 18-31, 9-11-2018)

relating to the issuance of subpoenas in administrative code enforcement
hearings, including the form of the subpoena and related costs.

enforcement hearing to establish the existence of the violation of this Code
asserted in the Notice of Violation, notice of itemized bill for costs,
administrative citation, notice of demolition, or notice of emergency
abatement.

deciding the issues at an administrative hearing is proof by a preponderance of
the evidence.

present evidence in support of his or her case. A written declaration signed

Testimony may be given by telephone or other electronic means. If a party is
not represented and has no witnesses, they may testify and present evidence
accordingly.
   E.   All hearings are open to the public. They shall be recorded by audio
tape. Hearings may be held in part at the location of the violation if, in the

an attorney will be representing the responsible person at the hearing, notice

the Administrative Law Judge, the parties may enter into a stipulated
agreement, which must be signed by both parties. This agreement, if approved by
the Administrative Law Judge, shall be entered by the Administrative Law Judge
as the administrative code enforcement order. Entry of this agreement shall
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and the right to appeal.
   B.   Once the presentation of evidence and testimony is concluded in the
administrative code enforcement hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall
issue an administrative code enforcement order that affirms, modifies, or
rejects the notice or citation and the legal and factual basis for his
decision. The Administrative Law Judge may assess an amount of civil penalties
and costs that are due pursuant to the City uniform fee schedule and the
procedures in this title.

enforcement order, the Administrative Law Judge shall monitor the violations
and determine compliance. If the Administrative Law Judge determines there has
been a failure to comply with the administrative code enforcement order, he may
modify his order or issue new orders, including assessing fines and penalties,
up to the maximum allowed by law, or authorizing the City to abate the
violation, as he determines necessary to achieve compliance. (Ord. 18-31, 9-11-

the scope of the supplemental proceeding to issues that, in the court's
opinion, need to be clarified.
