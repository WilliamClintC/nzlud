(3) Waiver of the Fee. The court may, upon the consent of the city attorney, waive this fee if such a waiver would be in the interest of justice. (Ord. 403 §§ 1 – 3, 1995)

(e) All mill crews will be trained and expected to take initial attack on fires.

Monies utilized to establish this fund shall be $1,000 each from current expense, street, water and sewer funds. (Ord. 392 § 2, 1995)


2.55.020      Requiring a separate checking account for the city of Forks travel account. 

Pursuant to RCW 42.24.130, the city clerk/treasurer is hereby directed and ordered to open a checking account, within a reasonable period of time, on behalf of the city of Forks for the purpose of paying travel advancements. Authorized signatures shall be the mayor, clerk/treasurer, deputy clerk/treasurer and bookkeeper. (Ord. 392 § 3, 1995)


2.55.030      Policies – General.

(1) Needs of the City or Department. The need for travel is based on the requirements of a specific job or department, and while the convenience of the employee shall be considered, city or department requirements shall be the more important factor.

(2) Cost Reimbursement Basis. Travel expenses to out-of-area locations shall be provided on a per diem basis.

(3) Sharing of Costs. Employees attending the same function should share transportation whenever possible. If not feasible due to different departure times, dates, or other approved reason, the most cost effective method is to be used. Shared lodging is encouraged but not required. If employees incur extra expenses for their own convenience, they will be required to pay for the additional costs.

(4) Travel To and From Home. Travel to and from one’s home to the assigned work site is not a reimbursable travel expense.

(5) Travel Funded by Another Agency. When an organization other than the city of Forks agrees to pay out-of-area travel expenses for city employees, reimbursement will be credited to the travel fund.

(6) Travel Advancements.

(a) All advancements shall be paid out of the city of Forks revolving fund.

(b) The city of Forks shall have a prior lien against and a right to withhold any and all funds payable or to become payable to an employee provided with an advance, and said advance not utilized for the purpose so provided.

(i) The city of Forks shall also have the right to recoup interest on the sum owed at the rate of 10 percent per annum, until such time as repayment or justification (by either the mayor or the city clerk/treasurer) has been made.

(ii) No advance of any kind shall be made to an employee who is delinquent in accounting for or repaying a prior advance.

(iii) Advancements shall be estimated as closely as possible to the actual travel per diem anticipated for the trip. (Ord. 392 § 1(2A), 1995)


2.55.040      Travel expenses.

(1) Reimbursement Rate. The state of Washington rate for mileage is used when city of Forks representatives or employees use their personal vehicle for authorized city business. The purpose of such reimbursement is to cover costs of gas, oil, maintenance and insurance.

(2) Insurance Requirement. State law requires that owners of motorized vehicles carry an established amount of liability insurance. Employees who fail to do so while using their personal vehicle for city business may have travel expenses related to the use of their personal vehicle denied.

(3) Receipts for Public Transportation. When using public transportation, receipts are required for airline, railroad, and bus tickets, as well as for airport limousine, ferry, and taxi service. Taxicabs should be used only when other less costly forms of transportation are unavailable.

(4) Airline Travel. When airline travel is required the most economical ticket is to be purchased. It is acknowledged that air fares are frequently lower if a schedule is established to the convenience of the airline. Such schedules may result in an employee staying longer at the destination than the business trip requires. If savings can be substantiated as a result, meal and lodging expenses may be approved.

(5) Parking. Receipts for parking should be included with requests for reimbursement whenever possible. (Ord. 392 § 1(2B), 1995)


2.55.050      Meal expenses.

(1) Out-of-Area Expenses. Meal expenses on "out-of-area" travel will be reimbursed on a per diem basis using state of Washington rates.

(2) Meal Rates. Meal rates as established by the state are to be used. Individual meal rates are to serve as the maximum where only one or two meals are required in a given day.

(3) Allowable Meals for Traveling Less than a 24-Hour Period. Breakfast is allowed if an employee starts their trip before 7:00 a.m., or returns after 6:00 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the employee leaves before 11:00 a.m. or returns after 1:00 p.m. Dinner is allowed if the employee leaves before 5:00 p.m., or returns after 6:00 p.m. (Ord. 392 § 1(2C), 1995)


2.55.060      Lodging.

(1) As a general rule, the most modest lodging should be sought. In a case where the city has a contract with a vendor in the area, then the employee must use that vendor. Lodging should be obtained at commercial or government rates whenever possible. Receipts for lodging must be turned in at the time of the request for reimbursement or prearranged for direct billing to the city of Forks.

(2) When a workshop, seminar or training function is to take place at a specific lodging complex or facility, the employee will be allowed to stay at that facility or another function sponsored facility at the best rate offered for such lodging. (Ord. 392 § 1(2D), 1995)


2.55.070      Registration and conference fees.

Required registration and conference fees may be handled in one of three ways: (1) the employee personally pays for the fee and is reimbursed as part of the reimbursement request; (2) the employee draws a travel advance sufficient to cover the cost of the registration; or (3) where time allows, the city pays for the fee directly to the conference sponsor prior to the event. Receipts are required in the first two instances. (Ord. 392 § 1(2E), 1995)


2.55.080      Miscellaneous expenses.

(1) Allowable Miscellaneous Expenses. Other allowable expenses may include, but are not limited to, car rentals, rental of rooms to conduct official business, charges for photocopying or other clerical requirements, and telephone calls. Receipts should be submitted whenever possible. When questions arise about appropriate expenditure or procedure, the state travel regulations should serve as a guide. If the state travel regulations do not cover the question, the city council has the authority to accept or reject claims for reimbursement.

(2) Unallowable Expenses. Certain travel expenses are considered as personal and are not essential to the transaction of official agency business and are not reimbursable. These types of expenses include, but are not limited to, the following: valet service, entertainment expenses including the cost of alcoholic beverages, radio, television, or VCR rentals, cost of transportation to and from a place of entertainment, cost of personal trip insurance, personal telephone calls unless it is a brief call to the employee’s residence to advise the family of a change in travel plans. (Ord. 392 § 1(2F), 1995)


2.55.090      Further regulation.

Department heads and the mayor of the city of Forks are authorized to issue further travel policies and procedures, including forms for their department and/or subordinates, so long as such policies and procedures are consistent with this resolution and in no way derogate from the requirements herein.

The following small works roster procedures are established for use by the city of Forks, pursuant to RCW 35.23.352 and Chapter 39.04 RCW. (Ord. 475 § 1, 2001)


2.80.020 Cost.

The city need not comply with formal sealed bidding procedures for the construction, building, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property where the estimated cost does not exceed $200,000, which includes the costs of labor, material, equipment and sales and/or use taxes as applicable. Instead, the city may use the small works roster procedures for public works projects as set forth herein. The breaking of any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if it is done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract that may be let using the small works roster process. (Ord. 475 § 1, 2001)


2.80.030 Number of rosters.

(1) The city may create a single general small works roster, or may create a small works roster for different specialties or categories of anticipated work. Said small works rosters may make distinctions between contractors based upon different geographic areas served by the contractor.

(2) The city may utilize, as an alternative to the above roster system, a multi-governmental system that meets the statutory requirements for procurement. If an alternative is utilized, the council will be requested to adopt that alternative by resolution. (Ord. 611 § 1, 2014; Ord. 475 § 1, 2001)


2.80.040 Contractors on small works roster(s).

(1) The small works roster(s) created solely by the city shall consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the roster(s), and where required by law are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in this state. Contractors desiring to be placed on a roster or rosters must keep current records of any applicable licenses, certifications, registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with the city as a condition of being placed on a roster or rosters.

(2) Any alternative roster system employed by the city shall ensure that contractors found therein consist of responsible contractors that are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in this state in addition to complying with all other enrollment requirements established by the managers of the alternative roster system. (Ord. 611 § 2, 2014; Ord. 475 § 1, 2001)


2.80.050 Publication.

(1) Roster(s) created solely by the city shall require the city to at least once a year publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit the names of contractors for such roster or rosters. Responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time that they submit a written request and necessary records. The city may require master contracts to be signed that become effective when a specific award is made using a small works roster. An interlocal contract or agreement between the city of Forks and other local governments establishing a small works roster or rosters to be used by the parties to the agreement or contract must clearly identify the lead entity that is responsible for implementing the small works roster provisions.

(2) Any alternative roster system employed by the city shall still require the city to publish notice at least once a year in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction about the city’s use of such an alternative and how interested contractors can access enrollment information. (Ord. 611 § 3, 2014; Ord. 475 § 1, 2001)


2.80.060 Telephone or written quotations.

The city shall obtain telephone, written or electronic quotations for public works contracts from contractors on the appropriate small works roster to assure that a competitive price is established and to award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, as defined in RCW 43.19.1911, as follows:

(1) A contract awarded from a small works roster need not be advertised. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for architectural or engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with building codes.

(2) Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster. As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least five contractors on the appropriate small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the appropriate roster.

If the estimated cost of the work is from $100,000 to $200,000, the city may choose to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster but must also notify the remaining contractors on the appropriate small works roster that quotations on the work are being sought. The city has the sole option of determining whether this notice to the remaining contractors is made by:

(a) Publishing notice in a legal newspaper in general circulation in the area where the work is to be done;

(b) Mailing a notice to these contractors; or

(c) Sending a notice to these contractors by facsimile or other electronic means.

(3) For purposes of this resolution, “equitably distribute” means that the city may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster over other contractors on the appropriate small works roster who perform similar services. At the time bids are solicited, the city representative shall not inform a contractor of the terms or amount of any other contractor’s bid for the same project.

(4) A written record shall be made by the city representative of each contractor’s bid on the project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by telephone inquiry.

(5) At least once every year a list of the contracts awarded under that process is to be furnished to the city council and made available to the general public. The list shall contain the name of the contractor or vendor awarded the contract, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed or items purchased under the contract, and the date it was awarded. The list shall also state the location where the bid quotations for these contracts are available for public inspection. (Ord. 475 § 1, 2001)


2.80.070 Determining lowest responsible bidder.

The city council shall award the contract, with the exception noted in FMC 2.80.080, for the public works project to the lowest responsible bidder; provided, that whenever there is a reason to believe that the lowest acceptable bid is not the best price obtainable, all bids may be rejected and the city council may call for new bids. In addition to price, the city council shall take into account the following:

(1) The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform the contract;

(2) Whether the bidder can perform the contract within the time specified by the city;

(3) The quality of the bidder’s performance of previous contracts or services;

(4) The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws relating to the contract or services. (Ord. 475 § 1, 2001)


2.80.080 Award.

The mayor or their designee shall present all telephone quotations/bids and recommendation for award of the contract to the lowest responsible bidder to the city council. However, for public works projects under $30,000 or the amount as established by state law for cities with the same classification as Forks, whichever is greater, the mayor shall have the authority to award public works contracts without city council approval; provided, that the mayor or their designee presents to the council a quarterly summary of the use of the roster when the amount for a specific project is less than $30,000. For public works projects over $30,000, or the amount as established by state law for cities with the same classification as Forks, whichever is greater, the city council shall award all public works contracts pursuant to this chapter.

3.60.010      Purpose.

Acquisition of a local utility district by the city has created a need for procedures to segregate assessments levied against property within the local utility district. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1978)


3.60.020      Procedure.

Whenever any land against which there has been levied any special assessment shall have been sold in part or subdivided, any person owning any part of the land involved in the special assessment, including but not limited to local utility districts and local improvement districts, and desiring to have such special assessments against the tracts of land segregated to apply to smaller parts thereof, shall apply in writing to the city council. If the city council determines that a segregation should be made, they shall do so as nearly as possible on the same basis as the original assessment was levied, and the total of the segregated parts of the assessment shall equal the assessment before segregation. The city council shall send notice thereof by mail to the owners interested in the tract as shown on the general assessment roles. If no protest is filed within 20 days from the date of mailing said notice, the city council may then, by resolution, approve said segregation. If a protest is filed, the city council shall then have a hearing thereon, after mailing to the several owners at least 10 days’ notice of the time and place thereof. After the hearing, the city council may by resolution approve said segregation, with or without change. The resolution approving said segregation shall describe the original tract, the amount and date of the original assessment, and shall define the boundaries of the divided parts and the amount of the assessment chargeable to each part, and shall order the city clerk/treasurer to make segregation on the original assessment role as indicated in the resolution. A certified copy of the resolution shall be delivered to the city clerk/treasurer; provided, that this chapter shall not authorize the segregation of any assessment in any case where it appears that such property, when or as already divided according to the requested segregation, is not or would not be of sufficient value, or is not or would not be in such condition or title as to provide adequate security for the payment of the total amount of the unpaid assessment, penalties, interests and costs charged or chargeable against the undivided whole. (Ord. 199 § 2, 1978)


3.60.030      Clerk/treasurer.

The city clerk/treasurer is authorized to collect and receive from any owner or owners of any subdivision or subdivisions of any lot, tract, or parcel of land upon which an assessment, including local utility assessments and local improvement assessments, has been made or hereafter may be made, such portion of the assessment or assessments levied or to be levied against such lot, tract or parcel of land in the payment of said improvements. Upon receipt of a certified copy of the resolution of the city council authorizing such segregation, the city clerk/treasurer shall enter such segregation, together with the amount of the bonded interest with respect thereto on the assessment records and, upon payment thereof, together with any penalties occurring according to the law and any additional interest due with respect to such segregated portion, give a proper receipt. (Ord. 199 § 3, 1978)


3.60.040      Costs.

The city council may require as a condition to the order of segregation that the person seeking it pay the city reasonable engineering, clerical, and related costs incident to making the segregation. Such fee shall be paid to the city clerk/treasurer and shall be deposited in the general fund. (Ord. 199 § 4, 1978)

(Ord. 555 § 8, 2008)


8.20.080      Resolution by the city council to accept permits required.

Such a resolution may include and/or cover a series of storm events; provided, that any period of time does not extend back in time more than 24 months from the date of passage of the resolution.

Supervise construction of all extensions and additions and any construction work in connection with the present water system, and any new system that may be established.

An application must be made, in writing, on a standard form at the office of the water department. The application shall set forth: (a) signature of the applicant; (b) owner of the premises to be served; (c) location of premises; (d) address of party paying bills.

(3) An application is merely a written request for service and does not, in itself, bind the city to serve. The city reserves the right to serve water upon any premises, regardless of classification, through either metered or flat rate service. (Ord. 353 §§ 2, 3, 1993; Ord. 294 § 1, 1987; Ord. 246 § 4, 1982)


13.20.030 Contracts.

(1) Upon acceptance, the application shall be considered a contract in which the applicant agrees to abide by such rates, rules and regulations as may be adopted by the city, and to pay all bills promptly.

(2) When a customer’s requirements for water are unusual, or necessitate considerable special or reserve equipment or special consideration, the city may require a contract over and above general application contracts, for an extended period and may also require security satisfactory to the city to protect the city against loss and guarantee the performance of the provisions of said contract. The city reserves the right to make special contracts, the provisions and conditions of which may be different from or have exceptions to the regular published schedules. Such special contracts shall be in writing and signed by the proper customer and the city.

(3) Except for special contracts, which specify the length of time to which the contract rate shall be extended, all rates, rules and regulations are subject to change or modification by the city without notice. (Ord. 246 § 5, 1982)


13.20.040 Water charges.

(1) All water services charged are due and payable on the tenth day of each calendar month. Whenever any charge for furnishing water to any customer shall not be paid within 30 days after the same becomes due and payable, the city of Forks, upon prior notice, shall discontinue service of water to such customer and water shall not again be furnished to such customer until all outstanding obligations for water supplied to such customer shall have been paid in full. Whenever disconnection is made for nonpayment of bills, the city of Forks will charge $25.00 for the cost of collection and reconnection.

(2) The word “notice,” as used above, shall mean sending a written notice by regular mail to the customer and/or posting the property supplied with water. If more than one residence is supplied by a meter, such as apartment houses or trailer parks, then the owner of the property as well as each tenant shall be notified by regular mail and/or posting the property and each living unit contained thereon. Notice shall be sent and/or posted for the benefit of a property owner no less than 15 days prior to the shutoff date. If the owner does not pay within five days of the effective date of notice, then each of any tenants upon the owner’s property shall be notified by regular mail and/or posting of that tenant’s living unit at least five days before the shutoff date and the property owner shall have to pay an additional $1.00 per tenant notified in addition to any amounts due for water service.

(3) If any customer disputes the amount of a bill the city shall provide that person with an opportunity to meet with a representative of the water department to resolve the dispute. If a meeting is requested by the customer pursuant to this section, then the customer’s water shall not be shutoff for nonpayment of a disputed bill for at least 10 days from the date of the meeting even if the shutoff is authorized at an earlier date pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.

(4) At the time specified by a customer that he expects to vacate the premises where service is supplied, or that he desires service to be discontinued, the meter will be read, turned off and a bill rendered, which is payable immediately. If the homeowner desires the water to be left on, a bill will be rendered to owner for minimum monthly charges.

(5) If, at the customer’s request, the water is turned on and off, or vice versa, more than once in a meter reading month, a minimum charge of $10.00 will be made for the labor involved.

(6) Each customer vacating any premises supplied with water service by the city will be responsible for all water supplied to the premises until the city shall have notice of such removal.

(7) Any landowner who has apartments on his property which consist of three or more units, obtaining service from one meter, shall be charged a surcharge of $2.00 per unit in addition to the minimum and meter charges, occupied or not.

(8) Any landowner who has mobile homes and/or trailers on his or her property consisting of three or more mobile homes and/or trailers placed at locations where they are capable of obtaining service from one meter shall be considered a trailer park or court and shall be charged a surcharge of $2.00 per mobile home or trailer in addition to the minimum and meter charges, whether or not such mobile homes and/or trailers are currently occupied.

13.20.045 Billing adjustments.

Pursuant to a policy approved by the city council, and subject to modification from time to time by the council, the director of public works, acting as the water superintendent, shall be authorized to approve or deny the adjustment of water billings when a request has been made by a customer following that customer’s repair of an outdoor water line that had been leaking. Further, pursuant to such a policy referenced herein, the director of public works may make only one billing adjustment during any five-year period when the requested adjustment is related to a repaired, substantially costly water leak occurring within a building associated with the customer water account for that building and/or parcel. (Ord. 578 § 1, 2010; Ord. 568 § 1, 2009)


13.20.050 Consent for private connections.

(1) It shall be a violation of these rules and regulations for any person or persons to attach to or detach from any water main or service pipe, or water connections through which water is supplied by the city of Forks. No person supplied with water from the city mains will be entitled to use it for any other purpose than stated in their original application, or supply in any way other persons, or premises, or to interfere in any manner with any pipe or connection without first making written application to the city.

(2) It shall be a violation of these rules and regulations for any person to use or tamper with any valve, curbstop, etc., which is the property of the city for the purpose of turning water on or off, without the express consent of the city. The city shall hold any person responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to any of the city’s property caused by such usage or tampering. The city requires every property owner to install his own valve in his own pipe for the control of service to his premises.

(3) It shall be a violation of these rules and regulations for any person, or persons to cut, alter, change, remove, disconnect or connect with or in any manner interfere, meddle or tamper with any fire hydrant owned or used by the city; provided, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to the city of Forks fire department, and/or street department. Other departments of the city may be allowed to connect to said fire hydrants, but before doing so must obtain consent from the water superintendent and must use a spanner or regulation wrench in connection therewith. (Ord. 246 § 7, 1982)


13.20.060 Responsibility and service preference.

(1) The city shall not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature whatsoever caused by any defect in the customer’s line, plumbing or equipment, and the city may, without notice, discontinue service to any customer when a defective condition of plumbing or equipment upon the premises of the customer results, or is likely to result, in interference with proper service or is likely to cause contamination of the water. The city does not assume the duty of inspecting the customer’s lines, plumbing or equipment, and shall not be responsible therefor, and will not be liable for failure of customer to receive service on account of defective plumbing or apparatus on the customer’s premises.

 (2) Should any meter fail to register correctly, or if a leak should be detected, the city may adjust the billing accordingly. Such adjustment shall be estimated by the city from a corresponding period. In the case of a leak, an adjustment will be made when the leak is detected. The city, however, will adjust only once for a leak and it is the property owners’ responsibility to fix the leak, as the city will adjust only one billing.

(3) The city will not permit any physical connection between a private water supply and the city’s distribution system or supply line.

(4) The city will exercise reasonable diligence and care to furnish and deliver a continuous and sufficient supply of water to the customer avoiding any shortage or interruption of delivery of the same. However, the city will not be liable for high or low pressure conditions, interruption or shortage or insufficiency of supply, or any loss or damage occasioned thereby. The city, whenever it shall find it necessary to make repairs or improvements to its system, shall have the right to suspend, temporarily, the delivery of water, but in all such cases, if possible, a reasonable notice will be given to customers, and repairs and improvements will be completed as rapidly as possible.

(5) The use of water upon the premises of the customer is at the risk of the customer, and the responsibility of the city shall cease 12 inches inside the customer’s side of the meter.

(6) In case of shortage of supply, the city reserves the right to give preference in the manner of furnishing service for the best interest of public convenience and necessity. (Ord. 246 § 8, 1982)


13.20.070 Transfer of service.

Owners of rental properties may file a “continuous service agreement” with the water department office, requesting that water service be transferred directly into the owner’s name, upon the water department receiving a removal notice under FMC 13.20.040 from a tenant. Automatic transfers will still be subject to the $15.00 service fee under FMC 13.20.020. Rental properties not covered by a “continuous service agreement” will be treated as any other property where a service removal has been filed and will be subject to the $25.00 connection fee under FMC 13.20.020, along with the $15.00 service fee under FMC 13.20.020. (Ord. 353 § 6, 1993)


13.20.080 New services.

All new water services will be required to purchase a water meter. Additional cost for labor and material will be required if the water main line does not border the resident’s property. (Ord. 381 § 5, 1994)


13.20.090 Discontinued water services.

If a service has been discontinued for any reason and the city of Forks cannot determine that a service has been at that location it will be considered a new service and all fees will apply. If the city of Forks can verify that a service was at that location then it will re-establish that service. The city of Forks will determine if a service existed by locating a meter box in the ground or having any record of an account for that location (meter book page or someone who may have signed for that location). The property owner will be responsible for protecting any unused services. If an unused service has been covered up the owner will be responsible for any costs incurred to re-establish this service. (Ord. 381 § 6, 1994)


13.20.100 Considered regular customer when.

Customers applying for water service after a meter reading day during any month will be considered a regular customer and will be billed on the first day of the second following month for water consumption and minimums. (Ord. 353 § 7, 1993)


13.20.110 Deposits. 

Customer water deposits held by the city of Forks as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall be credited to the customer’s account unless the customer has had a disconnection for nonpayment of bills in the last six months. (Ord. 353 § 8, 1993)


13.20.120 Water main extension contracts.

In accordance with the Laws of the State of Washington of 1959, Chapter 261 and subsequent amendments (RCW 35.91.010 through 35.91.050), the city may from time to time, as it deems necessary and advisable, contract with owners of real estate for the construction of water mains, hydrants or appurtenances, hereinafter called “water facilities,” within the corporate limits of the city or within 10 miles of the corporate limits connecting with the public water system to serve the area in which real estate of such owners is located, and to provide for a period of not to exceed 15 years from the reimbursement of such owners and their assigns by any owner of real estate who did not contribute to the original cost of such water facilities, and who subsequently tap on to or use the same of the fair pro rata share of the cost of construction of said water facilities, including not only those directly connected thereto, but also users connected to laterals or branches connected thereto, subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as the city may provide or contract, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law. The provisions of such contract shall not be effective as to any owner of real estate not a party thereto unless such contract shall have been recorded in the office of the county auditor for Clallam County prior to the time such owner taps into or connects to said water facilities.

That in connection with the terms of the contract and the law enforcement thereof all of the terms of Chapter 261, Laws of 1959, as hereafter amended, shall apply. (Ord. 246 § 9, 1982)


13.20.130 Meters.

(1) After September 1, 1953, all premises or customers served by the city shall be metered. All meters will be owned, installed and maintained by the city, unless otherwise provided in special contracts and/or writing.

(2) Where a meter is used to measure the total water used, as in apartment houses, residential courts, water districts, etc., the city will not furnish or read auxiliary or submeters used for the customer’s convenience.

(3) The city will keep an accurate account of its meter reading books, which shall be offered at all times, places and courts as prima facia evidence of the use of water service by the customer, and shall be the basis on which all bills are calculated.

(4) The city will, upon request, test any customer’s meter, and where circumstances require, adjust for wrong charges. When a customer requests a meter test, a deposit of $10.00 to cover the cost of testing will be required of the customer. The amount deposited will be returned to the customer if the meter is found to overregister more than two percent under conditions of normal operation. The customer will have the right to require the test to be conducted in the presence of an expert or other representative appointed by him.

(5) All meters will be tested before installation and no meter will be placed in service or allowed to remain in service which is known to have a registration error in excess of two percent under normal conditions.

(6) Meters will be read monthly and bills rendered, based on total consumption.

(7) When making charges, all meters serving a customer’s premises will be considered separately and the readings will not be combined or split, except where the city, for operating necessity, elects to install two or more meters at a central location. These readings will be combined in making charges.

(8) Only one residence or business will be served by a meter.

(9) The location of the meter or meters must be a place satisfactory to the city before service will be supplied. Ordinarily meters will be installed outside of buildings and between the property line and curb. Where meters are at present or may be installed within a building, the city will not be held responsible for damage for seepage through the wall, nor from leaking meter, pipe or fittings.

(10) No rent or other charge shall be made by the customer against the city for placing or maintaining meters upon customer’s premises.

(11) If a meter under-registers due to tampering or piping or in any other way causing under registering, service may be discontinued and will not be reconnected until restitution has been made for the loss of revenue, and satisfactory assurance given that there will be no more tampering.

(12) Meter readings are to be averaged during any period when it is impossible or impracticable to read meters on regular reading date. (Ord. 626 § 1, 2016; Ord. 353 § 9, 1993; Ord. 246 § 10, 1982)


13.20.140 Authority – Violation, penalty.

(1) The city shall have authority to decide any questions which may arise and are not fully covered by any of the provisions of this chapter, and all decisions shall be final. The right is reserved by the city to amend or add to these rules and regulations as experience shows necessity or expediency.

(2) Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter of the city shall be prosecuted as a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00 or imprisonment, or both. (Ord. 246 § 11, 1982)


13.20.150 Tax addition schedule.

The amount of the total of any or all revenue, or other form of tax imposed by any federal or state taxing body upon the city, may be apportioned among the various different classes of service furnished therein, and shall constitute an additional charge to any amounts billed to any customer under any rate schedule or special contract covered by ordinances covering the city.

Article I. Authority, Findings, Purpose


14.05.010      Statutory authorization.

The Legislature of the state of Washington has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 211 § 1.1, 1979)


14.05.020      Findings of fact.

(1) The flood hazard areas of Forks are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 211 § 1.2, 1979)


14.05.030      Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

(1) To protect human life and health;

(2) To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

(7) To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

(8) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 211 § 1.3, 1979)


14.05.040      Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 

(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 

(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 211 § 1.4, 1979)

Article II. Definitions


14.05.050      Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

(1) "Appeal" means a request for a review of the building inspector’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

(2) "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one foot to three feet, a clearly defined channel does not exist, the path of the flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

(3) "Areas of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

(4) "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the "100-year flood." Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

(5) "Basement" means any area of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

(6) "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling, or storage of equipment or materials operations located within the area of special flood hazard.

(7) "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

(a) The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

(b) The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

(8) "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration or the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

(9) "Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

(10) "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

(11) "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at FMC 14.05.290(2).

(12) "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.

(13) "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

(14) "New construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.

(c) Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

(d) Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

(16) "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure.

(17) "Structure" means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

(18) "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

(a) Before the improvement or repair is started; or

(b) If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

The term does not, however, include either:

14.05.160      Use of other base flood data.

When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with FMC 14.05.070, Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer FMC 14.05.280, Specific standards, and 14.05.320, Floodways. (Ord. 303 § 3, 1988; Ord. 211 § 4.3-2, 1979)


14.05.170      Information to be obtained and maintained.

(1) Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study (FIRM) or required as in FMC 14.05.160, obtain and record the actual as built elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.

(2) For all new or substantially improved nonresidential floodproofed structures:

(a) Verify and record the actual elevation to which the structure was floodproofed (in relation to mean sea level); and

(b) Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in FMC 14.05.120(2)(c).

(2) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. (Ord. 211 § 4.3-4, 1979)


14.05.190      Interpretation of FIRM boundaries.

Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the area of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Article V. (Ord. 211 § 4.3-5, 1979)

 Article V. Variance Procedure


14.05.200      Appeal board.

(1) The city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

(2) The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

(3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the city council or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the superior court of Clallam County.

(4) In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 

(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

(5) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (4)(a) through (k) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(6) Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (4) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(7) The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 211 § 4.4-1, 1979)


14.05.210      Conditions for variances.

(1) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.

(2) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(3) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(4) Variances shall only be issued upon:

(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(b) A determination that the granting of a variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in FMC 14.05.200(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(5) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 

(6) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

(7) Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (1) of this section, and otherwise complies with FMC 14.05.230 and 14.05.240. (Ord. 303 § 5, 1988; Ord. 211 § 4.4-2, 1979)

(3) Prohibit the placement of any mobile homes, except in an existing mobile home park or existing mobile home subdivision. (Ord. 525 § 4, 2004; Ord. 211 § 5.3, 1979)


14.05.330      Shallow flooding areas with depth designations.

Shallow flooding zones appear on FIRMs, with depth designations, wherever such flooding occurs on sloping water surfaces such as alluvial fan flow, wave wash after the wave has broken, etc. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

(1) New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures with AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the adjacent grade of the building site, to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM. Where appropriate, such structures shall be elevated above the crown of the nearest road, to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM. Where hazardous velocities are noted on the FIRM, consideration shall be given to mitigating the effects of these velocities through proper construction techniques and methods.

(2) New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:

(a) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the adjacent grade of the building site, to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM. Where appropriate, such structures shall be elevated above the crown of the nearest road, to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM; or

(b) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect.

Where hazardous velocities were noted on the FIRM, consideration shall be given to mitigating the effects of these velocities through proper construction techniques and methods. (Ord. 215 § 1, 1979)

Article VII. Flood Hazard Management Plan

(4) If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by any department head in coordination with the city attorney/planner.

(5) Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

(6) Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal. In most cases, the department discussed herein will be the city attorney/planner.

(7) When the city is lead agency for a MTCA remedial action, the Department of Ecology shall be provided an opportunity under WAC 197-11-253(5) to review the environmental documents prior to public notice being provided. If the SEPA and MTCA documents are issued together with one public comment period under WAC 197-11-253(6), the city shall decide jointly with Ecology who receives the comment letters and how copies of the comment letters will be distributed to the other agency. (Ord. 449 § 4(C), 1998)


14.10.060      Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the city’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 449 § 4(D), 1998)


14.10.070      Additional timing considerations.

For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission. (Ord. 449 § 4(E), 1998)


14.10.080      Categorical exemptions and threshold determinations – Purpose of this part and adoption by reference.

This part contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a "probable significant, adverse environmental impact" requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This part also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference, as supplemented in this part:

(Ord. 449 § 5(A), 1998)


14.10.090      Flexible thresholds for categorical exemptions.

(1) The city established the following exempt levels for minor new construction pursuant to WAC 197-11-800(1)(b) based upon local conditions; provided, that none of the construction projects exempted below do not require a special or conditional use permit:

(a) For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i) up to nine dwelling units;

(b) For agricultural structures in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(ii) up to 30,000 square feet;

(c) For office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage buildings in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii) up to 6,000 square feet and up to 30 parking spaces;

(d) For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iv) up to 30 parking spaces;

(e) For land fills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v) up to 500 cubic yards.

(2) Whenever the city established new exempt levels under this section, it shall send them to the Department of Ecology, Headquarters Office, Olympia, Washington, 98504 under WAC 197-11-800(1)(c). (Ord. 449 § 5(B), 1998)


14.10.100      Use of exemptions.

(1) Each department within the city that receives an application for a license, or in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

(2) In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

(3) If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

(a) The city shall not give authorization for:

(i) Any nonexempt land use action, to include but not limited to actions within critical areas, actions requiring a special or conditional use permit, and similar type activities;

(ii) Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact;

(iii) Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives.

(b) A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

(c) A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt actions were not approved. (Ord. 449 § 5(C), 1998)


14.10.110      Environmental checklist.

(1) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been competed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.

(2) For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

(3) The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

(a) The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

(b) The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.

(4) For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the city shall use the environmental checklist form noted above or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with or as part of a planned action ordinance, or developed after the ordinance is adopted. In either case, a proposed modified environmental checklist form must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a 30-day review prior to use. (Ord. 449 § 5(D), 1998)


14.10.120      Mitigated DNS.

(1) As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

(2) An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

(a) Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

(b) Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

(3) The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 10 working days. The response shall:

(a) Be written;

(b) State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and

(c) State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

(4) As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

(5) When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

(a) If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

(b) If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

(c) The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to "control noise" or "prevent stormwater runoff" are inadequate, where proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or "construct 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location" are adequate.

(d) Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

(6) A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice.

(7) Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.

(8) If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).

(9) The city’s written response and subsection (2) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 449 § 5(E), 1998)

(3) The city may deny a permit or approval for a proposal on the basis of SEPA so long as:

(a) A finding is made that approving the proposal would result in probable significant adverse environmental impacts that are identified in a FEIS or final SEIS prepared pursuant to this chapter; and

(b) A finding is made that there are no reasonable mitigation measures capable of being accomplished that are sufficient to mitigate the identified impact; and

(c) The denial is based on one or more policies identified in subsection (4) of this section and identified in writing in the decision document.

(4) The city designates and adopts by reference the following policies as the basis for the city’s exercise of authority pursuant to this section:

14.10.200      Appeals. 

The city establishes the following administrative appeal procedures under RCW 43.21C.075 and WAC 197-11-680:

(1) Any agency or person may appeal the city’s procedural compliance with Chapter 197-11 WAC for issuance of the following:

(a) A final DNS. Appeal of the DNS determination must be made to the city council, by submitting a written request for an appeal with substantive reasons for the appeal, within 14 days of the date DNS determination is made. If no appeals are made, the DNS determination shall be considered final by the applicant.

(b) A DS. The appeal must be made to city council, by submitting a written request for an appeal with substantive reasons for the appeal, within 14 days of the date of DS determination. If no appeals are made, the DS determination shall be considered final by the applicant.

(c) An EIS. Appeal of the city’s substantive determination on the EIS must be made to city council, by submitting a written request for an appeal with substantive reasons for the appeal, within 14 days of the date determination is made. If no appeals are made, the determination shall be considered final by the applicant.

(2) Appeals shall be heard by the city council acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. Prior to hearing the appeal, the mayor shall ascertain as to whether there are any conflicts of interest amongst the council, or if any ex parte contacts have occurred. Those having conflicts of interest shall be excused from the proceeding.

Those having ex parte contacts shall disclose those on the record prior to the commencement of the hearing. Such a disclosure shall include the time, nature and individual with whom the council member had the contact. Unless objected to by the applicant or the appellant, the individual shall remain a member of the appellate body. If objected to, the member may be excused; provided, that sufficient numbers of the council remain to conduct business. If the excusing of those with ex parte contacts, after the exclusion of members with conflicts of interest, would result in a lack of a quorum, the member shall remain and participate in the proceeding out of necessity.

After the above has been done, the hearing will begin and the following agenda shall be utilized:

(a) Staff report;

(b) Appellant’s basis for the appeal and testimony;

(c) Respondent’s reply and testimony;

(d) Public comment, if any;

(e) Questions of appellant, respondent, and/or public by the council.

Once the council’s questions have been answered, the mayor shall move the hearing into deliberations. During deliberations of the council, the council may ask questions of those present. The council shall render its decision within 21 days of the close of the hearing.

An appeal of a SEPA decision may be consolidated with any other appeals on the project; provided, that the request for such a combined appeal process is made by the appellant within the timelines specified by the applicable ordinances. If a difference in the timeline for various appeals exists, the city shall follow the timeline that ensures that sufficient notice is given for the appeal.

(3) For any appeal under this subsection, the city shall provide for a record that shall consist of the following:

(a) Findings and conclusions;

(b) Testimony under oath; and

(c) A taped or written transcript.

(4) The city may require the appellant to provide an electronic transcript.

(5) The procedural determination by the city’s responsible official shall carry substantial weight in any appeal proceeding. (Ord. 449 § 9(C), 1998)

Article I. Findings and Purpose


14.15.010      Findings of fact.

The city council of the city of Forks hereby finds that:

(1) Wetlands and their buffer areas are valuable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, soil liquefaction potential, and septic disposal limitations.

(2) In their natural state, wetlands provide many valuable social and ecological services, including:

(a) Controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or regulating natural flows;

(b) Protecting water resources by filtering out water pollutants, processing biological and chemical oxygen demand, recycling and storing nutrients, and serving as settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation;

(c) Providing areas for ground water recharge;

(d) Preventing shoreline erosion by stabilizing the substrate;

(e) Providing habitat areas for many species of fish, wildlife, and vegetation, many of which are dependent on wetlands for their survival, and many of which are on Washington State and federal endangered species lists;

(f) Providing open space and visual relief from intense development in urbanized areas;

(g) Providing recreation opportunities; and

(h) Serving as areas for scientific study and natural resource education.

(3) Development in wetlands often results in the reduction of services provided by wetlands.

(4) Buffer areas surrounding wetlands assist in the maintenance and protection of wetland functions and values.

(5) The loss of the social and ecological services provided by wetlands results in a detriment to public safety and welfare; replacement of such services, if possible at all, can require considerable public expenditure.

(6) A considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost or degraded by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, polluting, and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas. Remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost, despoiled, or impaired by such acts.

It is therefore necessary for the city of Forks to protect for wetland areas by discouraging development activities in wetlands and those activities at adjacent sites that may adversely affect wetland functions and values.

(7) Economic factors should be considered in the application and interpretation of wetland ordinances due to the limited number of wetlands in the city of Forks and surrounding areas, the limited resources available to the city of Forks to administer wetlands ordinances, and the priority of the city of Forks to promote and foster economic development. (Ord. 341 § 1.1, 1992)


14.15.020      Purpose.

(1) The primary purpose of this chapter is to satisfy the requirements of the Growth Management Act. Pursuant to the requirements of the Growth Management Act, it is the policy of the city of Forks to promote the protection of wetlands and to avoid or minimize damage to wetlands wherever possible and economically feasible and to encourage activities not dependant upon a wetland location to be located at upland sites.

(2) In addition, it is the intent of the city of Forks that activities in or affecting wetlands not threaten public safety, cause nuisances, or destroy or degrade natural wetland functions and values by adversely impacting the social and ecological services provided by wetlands as detailed in FMC 14.15.010(2). (Ord. 341 § 1.2, 1992)

(Ord. 550 §§ 1 – 3, 2007; Ord. 341 § 2, 1992)

Article III. General Provisions


14.15.040      Abrogation and greater restrictions.

It is not intended that this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing regulations, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. (Ord. 341 § 3, 1992)

Article IV. Lands to Which this  Chapter Applies


14.15.050      Applicability.

(1) When any provision of any other chapter of the Forks Municipal Code conflicts with this chapter, that which provides more protection to wetlands and wetland buffers shall apply unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter.

(2) The planning director is authorized to adopt written procedures for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter. Prior to fulfilling the requirements of this chapter, the city of Forks shall not grant any approval or permission to conduct a regulated activity in a wetland or wetland buffer. (Ord. 341 § 4.1, 1992)


14.15.060      Maps and inventory.

This chapter shall apply to all lots or parcels on which wetlands and/or wetland buffers are located within the city of Forks. The approximate location and extent of wetlands are shown on the adopted critical area(s) maps.* The city of Forks critical areas map is hereby adopted. Said map was created using information obtained from the National Wetlands Inventory, as well as field verification of wetlands by contractors hired by the city of Forks. Additionally, soil maps produced by U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service may be useful in helping to identify potential wetland areas. The National Wetlands Inventory and the USDA NRCS maps are to be used as a guide for the city of Forks, project applicants, and/or property owners to identify potential wetland areas that may be subject to the provisions of this title.

It is the actual presence of wetlands on a parcel, as delineated by the requirements of the Washington State Wetlands Identification and Delineation Manual (Ecology 1997), that triggers the requirements of this title, whether or not the wetland is identified on the adopted maps. The exact location of a wetland’s boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field delineation by a qualified wetlands professional, applying the Washington State Wetlands Identification and Delineation Manual (Ecology 1997) as required by RCW 36.70A.175. (Ord. 550 § 3, 2007; Ord. 341 § 4.2, 1992)

*Code reviser’s note: The critical area maps were adopted in 1994 and are on file with the city.


14.15.065      Exemptions.

(1) Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet are exempt from regulation where the applicant has shown that the wetland:

(a) Is not associated with a riparian corridor;

(b) Is not part of a wetland mosaic;

(c) Does not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

(2) Single-Family Residences.

(a) Expedited Approval. Applicants proposing a single-family dwelling may receive expedited approval by the city of Forks if they choose to adopt the largest buffer width from the appropriate wetland category. Expedited approval removes the requirements of the wetland certification process for single-family dwellings (subsection (2)(b) of this section); provided, that the wetland delineation and/or wetland rating is not disputed. Administrative buffer reductions or variance will not apply.

(b) Wetland Certification Process for Single-Family Dwellings (No Encroachment into a Regulated Wetland or its Standard Buffer).

(i) Prior to issuance of a building permit, site development permit, or on-site sewage system permit, the applicant may submit a single-family wetland certification form completed by a wetland specialist that certifies either:

(A) No regulated wetlands are present within 300 feet of the project area; or

(B) Wetlands are present within 300 feet of the project area, but all regulated activities associated with the dwelling (e.g., landscaped areas, septic facilities, outbuildings, etc.) will occur outside of the standard buffer of the identified wetland.

(ii) If regulated wetland buffers extend onto the site, the wetland specialist shall place permanent, clearly visible, wetland buffer signs at the edge of the buffer. A wetland buffer sign affidavit, signed by the wetland specialist, shall be submitted to the department as verification that the wetland buffer signs have been placed on the site.

(iii) A survey will not be required.

(iv) The single-family certification form may be used only to authorize single-family dwellings and associated home site features such as driveways, gardens, fences, wells, lawns, and on-site septic systems. It may not be used for new agricultural activities, expansion of existing agricultural activities, forest practice activities, commercial projects, land divisions, buffer width modifications, or violations.

(v) The single-family certification process will be monitored by the department for accuracy, and enforcement actions will be initiated should encroachment into a regulated wetland or buffer occur.

(vi) The applicant/property owner assumes responsibility for any and all errors of the single-family certification form and all associated mitigation imposed by the department.

(vii) Single-family certification forms shall be filed with the county auditor’s office.

(3) Trails – Stormwater – Utilities. The following uses may be permitted within a wetland buffer, provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize negative impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:

(a) Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife.

(b) Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical area report, including:

(i) Wildlife viewing structures; and

(ii) Walkways and trails, provided pathways minimize adverse impacts on water quality. They should generally be parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located in the outer 25 percent of the wetland buffer area, and avoid removal of significant trees. They must be limited to pervious surfaces no more than four feet in width. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings may be acceptable.

(c) Stormwater management facilities, limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales, when permitted by other applicable codes, may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only; provided, that:

(i) No other location is feasible; and

(ii) Their location, with mitigation, will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland. (Ord. 550 § 4, 2007)


14.15.070      Determination of regulatory wetland boundary.

(1) The exact location of the wetland boundary shall be determined by the applicant through the performance of a field investigation applying the wetland definition provided in FMC 14.15.030. The applicant is required under FMC 14.15.120(3) to show the location of the wetland boundary on a scaled drawing as a part of the permit application.

(2) The planning director may perform a delineation if he/she concludes that the applicant has not submitted a delineation that accurately represents the wetland boundary. The planning director may consult with qualified professional scientists and technical experts or other experts as needed to perform the delineation. The applicant may be charged for the costs incurred in accordance with the provisions of FMC 14.15.120(4). The planning director shall use the federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands as a guide in delineating wetlands.

(3) Signs and Fencing of Wetlands.

(a) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland buffer and the clearing limits identified by an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field with temporary "clearing limits" fencing, flagging, and/or other agreed-upon markings in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur. The marking is subject to inspection by the planning director prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

(b) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the planning director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer.

(i) Permanent signs shall be made of an enamel-coated metal face and attached to a metal post or another nontreated material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:

Protected Wetland Area Do Not Disturb Contact [Local Jurisdiction] Regarding Uses, Restrictions, and Opportunities for Stewardship

(ii) The provisions of subsection (3)(b)(i) of this section may be modified as necessary to assure protection of sensitive features or wildlife.

(c) Fencing.

(i) The planning director shall determine if fencing is necessary to protect the functions and values of the critical area. If found to be necessary, the planning director shall condition any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter to require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the wetland.

(ii) The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on-site.

(iii) Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. (Ord. 550 § 5, 2007; Ord. 341 § 4.3, 1992)


14.15.080      Wetlands rating system.

(1) Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State wetland rating system for Western Washington (Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington – Revised, Ecology Publication No. 04-06-025) or as revised by Ecology. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title or as it exists at the time of an associated permit application. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications.

(2) The following rating system is hereby adopted as the rating system for the city of Forks:

(a) Category I. Category I wetlands are:

(i) Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

(ii) Wetlands that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR as high quality wetlands;

(iii) All bogs;

(iv) Mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre;

(v) Wetlands in coastal lagoons; or

(vi) Wetlands that perform many functions well.

Category I wetlands represent a unique or rare wetland type, are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands, are relatively undisturbed and contain some ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime, or provide a very high level of functions.

(b) Category II. Category II wetlands are:

(i) Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

(ii) A wetland identified by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources as containing "sensitive" plant species;

(iii) An interdunal wetland larger than one acre; or

(iv) Wetlands with a moderately high level of functions.

Category II wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide high levels of some functions. These wetlands occur more commonly than Category I wetlands, but they still need a relatively high level of protection.

(c) Category III. Category III wetlands are:

(i) Wetlands with a moderate level of functions; or

(ii) Interdunal wetlands between one-tenth and one acre in size.

Generally, wetlands in this category may have been disturbed in some way and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.

(d) Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that should be replaceable, and in some cases may be improved. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree.

(3) The category designation of a wetland shall be determined by the applicant through the performance of a field investigation applying the four tier classification system detailed above. The applicant is required under FMC 14.15.120(3) to submit a written category designation with an explanation of the reasons for the designation.

(4) The planning director may perform the designation if he/she concludes that the applicant’s designation is not accurate. The planning director may consult with qualified professional scientists and technical experts or other experts as needed to perform the designation. The applicant may be charged for the costs incurred in accordance with the provisions of FMC 14.15.120(4). (Ord. 550 § 6, 2007; Ord. 341 § 4.4, 1992)

Article V. Allowed Activities


14.15.090      Allowed activities.

(1) Activities which are not regulated activities and which leave no material change in the wetland environment immediately after the activity ceases are allowed within a wetland or wetland buffer.

(2) The activities listed below are allowed in wetlands in addition to those activities listed in the provisions established in subsection (1) of this section. These activities do not require submission of a critical area report, except where such activities result in a loss to the functions and values of a wetland or wetland buffer. These activities include:

(a) Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing wetland;

(b) The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources;

(c) Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a wetland, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland boundary; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column is disturbed; or

(d) Enhancement of a wetland through the removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and disposed of in an appropriate manner. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species. (Ord. 550 § 7, 2007; Ord. 341 § 5, 1992)

Article VI. Procedures for Wetland Permits


14.15.100      Permit requirements and compliance.

Except as specifically provided in FMC 14.15.090, no regulated activity shall occur or be permitted to occur within a regulated wetland or wetland buffer without a written permit from the planning director. Any alteration approved by such written permit shall comply fully with the requirements and purposes of this chapter, other applicable regulations, and any terms or conditions of said permit. All activities which are not allowed or permitted shall be prohibited. (Ord. 341 § 6.1, 1992)


14.15.110      Wetland permits and extensions.

(1) Application for a wetland permit to conduct any regulated activity not specifically authorized by FMC 14.15.090 within a wetland or wetland buffer shall be made to the planning director on forms furnished by that office. Permits shall normally be valid for a period of three years from the date of issue and shall expire at the end of that time, unless a longer or shorter period is specified by the planning director upon issuance of the permit.

(2) An extension of an original permit may be granted upon written request to the planning director by the original permit holder or the successor in title. Prior to the granting of an extension, the planning director shall require updated studies and/or additional hearings if, in his judgment, the original intent of the permit is altered or enlarged by the renewal, if the circumstances relevant to the review and issuance of the original permit have changed substantially, or if the applicant failed to abide by the terms of the original permit. (Ord. 341 § 6.2, 1992)


14.15.120      Permit application.

(1) Request for Determination of Applicability. Any person seeking to determine whether a proposed activity or an area is subject to this chapter may request in writing a determination from the planning director. Such a request for determination shall contain plans, data, and other information as may be specified by the planning director.

(2) Pre-Permit Consultations. Any person intending to apply for a wetland permit is strongly encouraged, but not required, to meet with the planning director during the earliest possible stages of project planning in order to discuss wetland impact avoidance and minimization and compensation before large commitments have been made to a particular design. Effort put into re-application consultations and planning will help applicants create projects which will be more quickly and easily processed.

(3) Information Requirements. Application for a wetland permit under this chapter shall include one or more of the following information requirements upon demand by the planning director:

(a) A description and maps overlaid on an aerial photograph at a scale no smaller than one inch equals 200 feet, showing the entire parcel of land owned by the applicant and the exact boundary pursuant to FMC 14.15.070 of the wetland on the parcel;

(b) A description of the vegetative cover of the wetland and adjacent area, including dominant species;

(c) A site plan for the proposed activity overlaid on an aerial photograph at a scale no smaller than one inch equals 200 feet, showing the location, width, depth, and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, sewage treatment, and installations within the wetland and its buffer;

(d) The exact location sites and specifications for all regulated activities, including the amounts and methods;

(e) Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within the wetland and its buffer at contour intervals of no greater than five feet;

(f) Top view and typical cross-section views of the wetland and its buffer to scale;

(g) The purposes of the project and an explanation why the proposed activity cannot be located at other sites, including an explanation of how the proposed activity is dependant upon wetlands or water-related resources as described in FMC 14.15.160;

(h) Specific means to mitigate any potential adverse environmental impacts of the applicant’s proposal; and

(i) Classification of any on-site wetlands pursuant to the classification system of FMC 14.15.080 and written justification for said classification.

The planning director may require additional information, including but not limited to an assessment of the wetland functional characteristics, including a discussion of the methodology used; documentation of the ecological, aesthetic, economic, or other values of a wetland, a study of flood, erosion or other hazards at the site and the effect of any protective measures that might be taken to reduce such hazards, and any other information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this chapter or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this chapter. The planning director shall maintain and make available to the public all information applicable to any wetland and its buffer.

(4) Filing Fees. At the time of an application the applicant shall pay a filing fee as determined by the planning director. Sufficient fees shall be charged to the applicant to cover the costs of evaluation of the application or request for delineation. These fees may be used by the planning director to retain expert consultants to provide services pertaining to wetland boundary determinations, functional assessments, and evaluation of mitigation measures. As deemed necessary by the planning director, the planning director may assess additional reasonable fees as needed to monitor and evaluate permit compliance and mitigation measures.

(5) Notice on Title.

(a) The owner of any property with field verified presence of wetland or wetland buffer pursuant to FMC 14.15.070, on which a development proposal is submitted shall file for record with the appropriate records division a notice approved by the planning director in a form substantially as set forth in subsection (5)(b) of this section. Such notice shall provide notice in the public record of the presence of wetland or wetland buffer, the application of this chapter to the property, and that limitations on actions in or affecting such wetlands and their buffers may exist.

The applicant shall submit proof that the notice has been filed for record before the city of Forks shall approve any development proposal for such site. The notice shall run with the land and failure to provide such notice to any purchaser prior to transferring any interest in the property shall be in violation of this chapter.

(b) Form of Notice.

(Ord. 341 § 6.3, 1992)


14.15.130      Permit processing.

(1) Consolidation. The planning director shall, to the extent practicable and feasible, consolidate the processing of wetlands related aspects of other city of Forks regulatory programs which affect activities in wetlands.

(2) Completeness of Application. No later than 10 working days after receipt of the permit application, the planning director shall notify the applicant as to the completeness of the application. An application shall not be deemed complete until and unless all information necessary to evaluate the proposed activity, its impacts, and its compliance with the provisions of this chapter have been provided to the satisfaction of the planning director.

(3) Public Hearings. Following the submittal of an application determined to be complete by the planning director, the planning director or city council shall hold a public hearing on the application, unless the planning director finds that the activity is so minor as to not affect a wetland or wetland buffer. The planning director or the city council may, to the extent that the proposed activity impacts the benefits of the wetlands extending to others, require the applicant to comply with one or more of the following notice provisions, to be complied with at least 15 days prior to the date of hearing:

(a) Publish a notice of the hearing at least once a week on the same day of the week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the city of Forks;

(b) Give notice to the latest recorded real property owners as shown by the records of the county assessor within at least 300 feet of the boundary of the property upon which the regulated activity is proposed; and

(c) Post a notice at the proposed site of activity and at public places of assembly near the site of the proposed activity.

The notices shall include a brief description of the project, including the location, notice of the time and place of the hearing, notice that the file regarding the permit application is available for public inspection during regular business hours, comments prior to the hearing, and attendance and oral testimony by concerned parties at the hearing.

All hearings shall be open to the public. A record of the hearings shall be made. Any person may present evidence and testimony at the hearing. At the hearing the applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the proposed activity will be in accordance with the purposes of this chapter and the standards set forth below.

(4) Permit Action. The Forks city council shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny a permit application within 30 working days of the public hearing, except that where additional information is required by the Forks city council, it may extend this period by 60 days. In acting on the application, the Forks city council shall in writing deny, permit, or conditionally permit the proposed activity. If a decision must be made in a 90-day period and there is insufficient information or time to process the application, a denial will be issued. (Ord. 341 § 6.4, 1992)


14.15.135      Regulatory procedures for small wetlands.

(1) Evaluate wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet, using Ecology’s Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (2004), to establish category and evaluate functions. Use the following criteria and local knowledge of natural resources to make an informed decision about whether to exempt wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet from the requirement to avoid impacts.

(a) The requirement to avoid impacts may be dropped for Category III and IV wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet that meet all of the following criteria:

(i) Wetland is not associated with a riparian corridor; and

(ii) Wetland is not part of a wetland mosaic; and

(iii) Wetland does not score 20 points or more for habitat in the wetland rating system; and

(iv) Wetland does not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Where there is a desire to place high priority on water quality functions, add a criterion that includes wetlands that score 24 points or more for water quality function in the rating system. Such wetlands receive surface water drainage from the surrounding landscape and improve water quality before discharging water to downstream water bodies. This approach could include specific drainages where protection of water quality is given higher priority and there are significant wetland resources that provide high levels of this function.

(b) Impacts allowed under this provision to these wetlands will be fully mitigated as required in FMC 14.15.175, Mitigation requirements.

The rationale for dropping the requirement to avoid impacts for certain wetlands is based on the premise that functions provided by these Category III and IV wetlands can be adequately replaced by mitigation. This approach may benefit local wetland resources by providing part of the funding through a fee-in-lieu system for larger local restoration projects that could provide higher functioning wetlands in the long term.

(c) All Category I and II wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet should be evaluated with full mitigation sequencing and buffer establishment. Any approved impacts should be adequately compensated by mitigation.

(2) Wetlands larger than 4,000 square feet will be evaluated using standard procedures for wetland review found elsewhere in this chapter. (Ord. 550 § 8, 2007)

Article VII. Impacts


14.15.140      Standards for permit decisions.

(1) A permit shall be granted for activities in regulated wetlands or wetland buffers if the permit, as conditioned, is consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Additionally, permits shall be granted if:

(a) A proposed action avoids adverse impacts to regulated wetlands or their buffers or takes affirmative and appropriate measures to minimize and compensate for unavoidable impacts;

(b) The proposed activity results in no net loss; or

(c) Denial of a permit would deny the applicant of all reasonable economic use of his property. The inability to derive reasonable economic use of the property may not be the result of actions by the applicant in segregating or dividing the property and creating the undevelopable condition after the effective date of this chapter.

(2) Wetlands permits shall not be effective and no activity thereunder shall be allowed during the time provided to file a permit appeal. (Ord. 341 § 7, 1992)


14.15.150      Wetland buffers.

(1) Wetland buffers shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to regulated wetlands. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary. The width of the wetland buffer zone shall be determined according to the wetland category as follows:

	Wetland Rating and Characteristics	Buffer Widths by Impact of Land Use*	Other Measures Recommended for Protection

	Category IV

(score for functions < 30 points)	Low – 25 feet

Moderate – 40 feet

High – 50 feet	 

	Category III – moderate level of function for habitat (score for habitat 20 – 28 points)	Low – 75 feet

Moderate – 110 feet

High – 150 feet	 

	Category III – not meeting above criteria for habitat	Low – 40 feet

Moderate – 60 feet

High – 80 feet	 

	Category II – high level of function for habitat (score for habitat 29 – 36 points)	Low – 150 feet

	Category II – high level of function for water quality improvement (score for water quality 24 – 32 points) and low level of function for habitat (score for habitat < 20 points)	Low – 50 feet

Moderate – 75 feet

High – 100 feet	No additional discharges of untreated runoff.

	Category II – not meeting any of above criteria for habitat or water quality	Low – 50 feet

Moderate – 75 feet

	Category I – Bogs	Low – 125 feet

Moderate – 190 feet

High – 250 feet	No additional discharges of surface water. Restore degraded parts of buffer.

	Category I – Forested	Buffer size needs to be based on score for habitat functions or water quality functions.	If forested wetland scores high for habitat, need to maintain connectivity to other natural areas. Restore degraded parts of buffer.

	Category I – high level of function for habitat (score for habitat 29 – 36 points)	Low – 150 feet

Moderate – 225 feet

High – 300 feet	Maintain connectivity to other natural areas. Restore degraded parts of buffer.

High – 100 feet	No additional discharges of untreated runoff.

	Category I – not meeting any of above criteria for habitat or water quality	Low – 50 feet

Moderate – 75 feet

High – 100 feet	 

	* See subsection (2)(c) of this section for definitions of high, moderate, and low impacts.

(2) Buffer Reduction. The buffer widths recommended for proposed land uses with high-intensity impacts to wetlands can be reduced by the planning director to those recommended for moderate-intensity impacts under the following conditions:

(a) For wetlands that score moderate or high for habitat (20 points or more for the habitat functions), the width of the buffer can be reduced if both of the following criteria are met:

(i) A relatively undisturbed, vegetated corridor at least 100 feet wide is protected between the wetland and any other priority habitats as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife ("relatively undisturbed" and "vegetated corridor" are defined in questions H 2.1 and H 2.2.1 of the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington – Revised, (Hruby 2004b)). Priority habitats in Western Washington include:

	Wetlands

	Riparian zones

	Aspen stands

	Cliffs

	Prairies

	Caves

	Stands of Oregon White Oak

	Old-growth forests

	Estuary/estuary-like

	Marine/estuarine shorelines

	Eelgrass meadows

	Talus slopes

	Urban natural open space (for current definitions of priority habitats, see http://wdfw.wa.gov/hab/phshabs.htm)

The corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat by some type of legal protection such as a conservation easement.

(ii) Measures to minimize the impacts of different land uses on wetlands, such as the examples summarized in Table 14.15-1, are applied.

(b) For wetlands that score less than 20 points for habitat, the buffer width can be reduced to that required for moderate land use impacts by applying measures to minimize the impacts of the proposed land uses (see examples in Table 14.15-1).

Table 14.15-1 Examples of Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands from Proposed Change in Land Use That Have High Impacts(this is not a complete list of measures)

(3) Buffer Averaging.

(a) The widths of buffers may be averaged if this will improve the protection of wetland functions, or if it is the only way to allow for reasonable use of a parcel. Averaging could be allowed in the following situations:

(i) Averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

(A) The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a "dual-rated" wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower-rated area.

(B) The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher-functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower-functioning or less sensitive portion.

(C) The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

(D) The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-fourths of the required width.

(ii) Averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following are met:

(A) There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging.

(B) The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a report from a qualified wetland professional.

(C) The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

(D) The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-fourths of the required width.

(b) Averaging may not be used in conjunction with any of the other provisions of this chapter associated with the reduction of a required wetland buffer (listed above).

(4) Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category and the proposed land use as identified in this title. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. Only fully vegetated buffers will be considered. Lawns, walkways, driveways, and other mowed or paved areas will not be considered buffers.

(5) Buffers on Mitigation Sites. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter and based on the expected category of the wetland once the mitigation actions are completed.

(6) Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed or enhanced condition. In the case of compensatory mitigation sites, removal of invasive nonnative weeds is required for the duration of the mitigation bond.

(7) Buffer Uses. The following uses may be permitted within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this title, provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:

(a) Conservation and Restoration Activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife.

(b) Passive Recreation. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical area report, including:

(i) Walkways and trails; provided, that those pathways are limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality. They should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer 25 percent of the wetland buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. They should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width for pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings may be acceptable; and

(ii) Wildlife viewing structures.

(c) Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities, limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales, may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only; provided, that:

(i) No other location is feasible; and

(ii) The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland. (Ord. 550 § 9, 2007; Ord. 341 § 7.1, 1992)


14.15.160      Avoiding wetland impacts.

(1) Regulated activities shall not be authorized in a regulated wetland except where it can be demonstrated that the impact is both unavoidable and necessary.

(2) Category I Wetlands. Activities and uses shall be prohibited from Category I wetlands, except as provided for in relationship to exceptions associated with public agencies and utilities, reasonable use, and variances within this chapter.

(3) Category II and III Wetlands. For Category II and III wetlands, the following standards shall apply:

(a) Where wetland fill is proposed, it is presumed that an alternative development location exists; activities and uses shall be prohibited unless the applicant can demonstrate that:

(i) The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished on another site or sites in the general region while still successfully avoiding or resulting in less adverse impact on a wetland; and

(ii) All on-site alternative designs that would avoid or result in less adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer, such as a reduction in the size, scope, configuration or density of the project, are not feasible.

(b) Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of wetlands and buffers shall be provided under the terms established under the mitigation elements of this chapter.

(4) Category IV Wetlands. Activities and uses that result in unavoidable impacts may be permitted in Category IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area(s) report and compensatory mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives. Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of wetlands and buffers shall be provided under the terms established under the mitigation elements of this chapter.

(5) Reasonable Use. If an applicant for a development proposal demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning director that application of these standards would deny all reasonable economic use of the property, development as conditioned shall be allowed if the applicant also demonstrates all of the following to the satisfaction of the planning director:

(a) That the proposed project is water-dependent or requires access to the wetland as a central element of its basic function, or is not water-dependent but has no practicable alternative, pursuant to this section;

(b) That the proposed activities will result in minimum feasible alteration or impairment to the wetland’s functional characteristics and its existing contours, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, and hydrological conditions;

(c) That the proposed activities will not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered, threatened, rare, sensitive, or monitor species as listed by the federal government or the state of Washington;

(d) That the proposed activities will not cause significant degradation of ground water or surface water quality;

(e) That there will be no damage to nearby public or private property and no threat to the health or safety of people on or off the property; and

(f) That the inability to derive reasonable economic use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant in segregating or dividing the property and creating the undevelopable condition after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 550 § 10, 2007; Ord. 341 § 7.2, 1992)


14.15.170      Minimizing wetlands impacts.

(1) After it has been determined by the planning director that a proposed activity will be authorized in a regulated wetland or wetland boundary, the applicant shall take deliberate measures to minimize wetland impacts.

(2) Minimizing impacts to wetlands shall include but is not limited to:

(a) Limiting the degree or magnitude of the regulated activity;

(b) Limiting the implementation of the regulated activity;

(c) Using appropriate and best available technology;

(d) Taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

(e) Sensitive site design and siting of facilities and construction staging areas away from regulated wetlands and their buffers;

(f) Involving resource agencies early in site planning; and

(g) Providing protective measures, such as siltation curtains and other siltation prevention measures, scheduling the regulated activity to avoid interference with wildlife and fisheries rearing, resting, nesting, or spawning activities. (Ord. 550 § 11, 2007; Ord. 341 § 7.3, 1992)


14.15.175      Mitigation requirements.

(1) Requirements for Compensatory Mitigation. Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with the Guidance on Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Guidelines for Developing Wetland Mitigation Plans and Proposals, April 2004 (Washington State Department of Ecology, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Seattle District, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10; Ecology Publication #04-06-013b), or as revised.

(2) Mitigation shall be required in the following order of preference:

(a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

(b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts.

(c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment.

(d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations.

(e) Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments.

(f) Monitoring the required compensation and taking remedial or corrective measures when necessary.

(3) Compensating for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensatory mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when either:

(a) The lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific function assessment, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

(b) Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

(4) Preference of Mitigation Actions. Methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions shall be approached in the following order of preference:

(a) Restoration (re-establishment and rehabilitation) of wetlands.

(b) Creation (establishment) of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species. This should only be attempted when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is anticipated in the design.

(c) Enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation. Such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

(5) Type and Location of Compensatory Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in-kind and on-site, or in-kind and within the same stream reach, sub-basin, or drift cell (if estuarine wetlands are impacted). Compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply:

(a) There are no reasonable on-site or in sub-drainage basin opportunities (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or on-site and in sub-drainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts.

(b) Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland.

(c) Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin unless:

(i) Established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or

(ii) Credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the bank’s certification.

(d) The design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location (i.e., position in the landscape).

(6) Timing of Compensatory Mitigation. It is preferred that compensatory mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will disturb the on-site wetlands. At the least, compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora.

The planning director may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (e.g., project delay lapses past a fisheries window; or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the compensatory mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the city.

(7) Mitigation Ratios.

(a) When an applicant proposes to alter or eliminate a regulated wetland, the functions and values of the affected wetland and buffer shall be replaced through wetland creation, re-establishment, rehabilitation, or enhancement, according to the minimum ratios established in the table in this section. The ratios shall apply to wetland creation, re-establishment, rehabilitation, or enhancement, which is in-kind, on-site, of the same category, timed prior to or concurrent with alteration, and has a high probability of success.

(b) Ratios for out-of-kind or off-site mitigation may be greater than set forth in the table, if the planning director determines that additional mitigation is warranted to mitigate impacts. Ratios for remedial actions resulting from unauthorized alterations shall be greater than set forth in the table; provided, that the extent of the increase shall be as determined by the planning director to be appropriate in the circumstances.

(c) Replacement ratios may be decreased by up to 25 percent by the planning director, if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning director that all of the following criteria are met:

(i) Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions have a very high likelihood of success;

(ii) Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the wetland being altered;

(iii) The proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of the impact and shown to be successful through post-construction monitoring and function assessment.

(d) The mitigation ratios in the following table are required for all projects with unavoidable impacts to wetlands:

	Affected Wetland	Mitigation Type and Ratio

	Category	Re-establishment or Wetland Creation	Rehabilitation	Re-establishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E)	Enhancement Only

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	6:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	8:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	1:1 R/C and 4:1 E	12:1

	Category I – Forested 	6:1	12:1	1:1 R/C and 10:1 E	24:1

	Category I – Score-Based	4:1	8:1	1:1 R/C and 10:1 E	16:1

	Category I – Bog	Not possible	6:1	Case by Case	Case by Case

(8) Preservation. Impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by preservation of wetland areas when used in combination with other forms of mitigation such as creation, restoration, or enhancement.

(a) Acceptable Uses of Preservation. The preservation of at-risk, high quality wetlands and habitat may be considered as part of an acceptable mitigation plan when the following criteria are met:

(i) Preservation is used as a form of compensation only after the standard sequencing of mitigation (avoid, minimize, and then compensate);

(ii) Restoration (re-establishment and rehabilitation), creation, and enhancement opportunities have also been considered, and preservation is proposed by the applicant and approved by the permitting agencies as the best compensation option;

(iii) The preservation site is determined to be under imminent threat; that is, the site has the potential to experience a high rate of undesirable ecological change due to on-site or off-site activities that are not regulated. This potential includes permitted, planned, or likely actions;

(iv) The area proposed for preservation is of high quality or critical for the health of the watershed or basin due to its location. Some of the following features may be indicative of high quality sites:

(A) Category I or II wetland rating (using the Washington State wetland rating system for Western Washington);

(B) Rare or irreplaceable wetland type (e.g., bogs, mature forested wetlands, estuaries) or aquatic habitat that is rare or a limited resource in the area;

(C) Habitat for threatened or endangered species;

(D) Provides biological and/or hydrological connectivity;

(E) High regional or watershed importance (e.g., listed as priority site in a watershed or basin plan);

(F) Large size with high species diversity (plants and/or animals) and/or high abundance of native species;

(G) A site that is continuous with the head of a watershed, or with a lake or pond in an upper watershed that significantly improves outflow hydrology and water quality.

(b) Preservation in Combination with Other Forms of Compensation. Using preservation as compensation is acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of one-to-one acreage replacement is provided by re-establishment or creation and the criteria below are met:

(i) All criteria listed in subsection (8)(a) of this section are met;

(ii) The impact area is small and/or impacts are occurring to a low-functioning system (Category III or IV wetland);

(iii) Preservation of a high quality system occurs in the same watershed or basin as the wetland impact;

(iv) Preservation sites include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation; and

(v) Mitigation ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation shall range from 10 to one to 20 to one, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being impacted and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.

(c) Preservation as the Sole Means of Compensation for Wetland Impacts. Preservation alone shall only be used as compensatory mitigation in exceptional circumstances. Preservation alone shall not apply if impacts are occurring to functions that must be replaced on-site, such as flood storage or water quality treatment that needs to be replicated by water quality measures implemented within the project limits. Preservation of at-risk, high quality wetlands and habitat (as defined above) may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met:

(i) All criteria listed in subsections (8)(a) and (b) of this section are met;

(ii) There are no adverse impacts to habitat for fish and species listed as endangered and threatened;

(iii) There is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin;

(iv) Higher mitigation ratios are applied. Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20 to one. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost.

(9) Wetland Mitigation Banks.

(a) Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:

(i) The bank is certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC;

(ii) The planning director determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

(iii) The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.

(b) Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

(c) Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, the service area of the bank may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions. (Ord. 550 § 12, 2007)


14.15.180      Limited density transfer.

(1) For development proposal on lands containing wetland buffers, the planning director shall determine allowable dwelling units for residential development proposals based on the formula below.

(2) The following formula for density calculations is designed to provide incentives for the preservation of wetlands and wetland buffers, flexibility in design, and consistent treatment of different types of development proposals. The formula shall apply to all properties within existing residential zones on which wetlands and wetland buffers are located.

The maximum number of dwelling units (du) for a lot or parcel which contains wetlands and wetland buffers shall be equal to: (acres in wetland buffer) (du/acre) (density credit).

(3) The density credit figure is derived from the following table:

	Percentage of Site in Buffers	 Density Credit

	1 – 10%	100%

	11 – 20%	90%

	21 – 30%	80%

	31 – 40%	70%

	41 – 50%	60%

	51 – 60%	50%

	61 – 70%	40%

	71 – 80%	30%

	81 – 90%	20%

	91 – 99%	10%

(4) The density credit can only be transferred within the development proposal site. To the extent that application of the formula may result in lot sizes less than the minimum allowed by the underlying district, they are hereby authorized; provided, that the resultant lot is of sufficient size for an on-site waste disposal system if no sanitary sewer system exists.

(5) The planning director shall not allow credit for density for the portions of the site occupied by wetlands. (Ord. 341 § 7.4, 1992)


14.15.190      Acting on the application.

(1) Bonding.

(a) Performance Bonds. The planning director shall require, if necessary, the application of a development proposal to post a cash performance bond or other security acceptable to the planning director in an amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with conditions and limitations set forth in the permit. The amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of the chapter. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the planning director may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. The planning director shall release the bond upon determining that:

(i) All activities have been completed in compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit and the requirements of this chapter;

(ii) Upon the posting by the applicant of a maintenance bond.

Until such written release of the bond, the principal or surety cannot be terminated or canceled.

(b) Maintenance Bonds. The planning director shall, if necessary, require the holder of a development permit issued pursuant to this chapter to post a cash performance bond or other security acceptable to the planning director in an amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to guarantee that structures, improvement, and mitigation required by the permit or by this chapter perform satisfactorily for a minimum of two years after they have been completed. The planning director shall release the maintenance bond upon determining that performance standards established for evaluating the effectiveness and success of the structures, improvements, and/or compensatory mitigation have been satisfactorily met for the required period. For compensation projects, the performance standards shall be those contained in the mitigation plan developed and approved during the permit review process, pursuant to FMC 14.15.120 and 14.15.175. The maintenance bond applicable to a compensation project shall not be released until the planning director determines that performance standards established for evaluating the effect and success of the project have been met.

(2) Suspension – Revocation. In addition to other penalties provided for elsewhere, the planning director may suspend or revoke a permit if he finds that the applicant or permittee has not complied with any or all of the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit, has exceeded the scope of work set forth in the permit, or has failed to undertake the project in the manner set forth in the approved application.

(3) Publication of Notice. The planning director shall cause notice of his issuance, conditional issuance, revocation, or suspension of a permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in the area wherein the wetland lies. Such notice shall be published within five working days of the decision or order and shall include at least the following:

(a) A brief description of the project, including location;

(b) The decision or order of the planning director with respect to the project;

(c) Notification that the permit file is open for public inspection during regular business hours, and the address where such file may be inspected; and

(d) A statement of the procedures regarding appeal or judicial review of the decision, if applicable. (Ord. 341 § 7.5, 1992)


14.15.200      Appeals.

Any decision of the planning director in the administration of this chapter may be appealed to-the city council. (Ord. 341 § 7.6, 1992)


14.15.210      Modification of wetland permits.

A wetland permit holder may request and the planning director may approve modification of a previously issued wetland permit. (Ord. 341 § 7.7, 1992)


14.15.220      Resubmittal of denied permit applications.

A wetland permit application which has been denied may be modified and resubmitted. (Ord. 341 § 7.8, 1992)

Article VIII. Enforcement – Appeals


14.15.230      Temporary emergency permit.

(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or any other laws to the contrary, the planning director may issue a temporary emergency wetlands permit if:

(a) The planning director determines that an unacceptable threat to life or severe loss of property will occur if an emergency permit is not granted; and

(b) The anticipated threat or loss may occur before a permit can be issued or modified under the procedures otherwise required by this act and other applicable laws.

(2) Any emergency permit granted shall incorporate, to the greatest extent practicable and feasible but not inconsistent with the emergency situation, the standards and criteria required for nonemergency activities under this act and shall:

(a) Be limited in duration to the time required to complete the authorized emergency activity, not to exceed 90 days; and

(b) Require within this 90-day period, the restoration of any wetland altered as a result of the emergency activity, except that if more than the 90 days from the issuance of the emergency permit is required to complete restoration, the emergency permit may be extended to complete this restoration.

(3) Issuance of an emergency permit by the planning director does not preclude the necessity to obtain necessary approvals from appropriate federal and state authorities.

(4) Notice of the issuance of the emergency permit and request for public comments shall be published at least once a week on the same day of the week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the city of Forks, no later than 10 days after issuance of the emergency permit.

(5) The emergency permit may be terminated at any time without process upon a determination by the planning director that the action was not or is no longer necessary to protect human health or the environment. (Ord. 341 § 8.1, 1992)


14.15.240      Enforcement.

The planning director shall have authority to enforce this chapter, any rule or regulation adopted, and any permit or order issued pursuant to this chapter against any violation or threatened violation thereof. The planning director is authorized to issue violation notices and administrative orders, levy fines, and/or institute legal actions in court. Recourse to any single remedy shall not preclude recourse to any of the other remedies. Each violation of this chapter, or any rule or regulation adopted, or any permit, permit condition, or order issued pursuant to this chapter, shall be a separate offense, and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day’s continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense. All costs, fees, and expenses in connection with enforcement actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. Enforcement actions shall include:

(1) Civil Penalties, Administrative Orders and Actions for Damages and Restoration.

(a) The planning director may bring appropriate actions at law or equity, including actions for injunctive relief, to ensure that no uses are made of a regulated wetland or their buffers which are inconsistent with this chapter or an applicable wetlands protection program.

(b) The planning director may serve upon a person a cease and desist order if an activity being undertaken on regulated wetlands or its buffer is in violation of the act, these rules, or a local wetlands protection program. Whenever any person violates this chapter or any permit issued to implement this chapter, the city of Forks may issue an order reasonably appropriate to cease such violation and to mitigate any environmental damage resulting therefrom.

(i) Content of Order. The order shall set forth and contain:

(A) A description of the specific nature, extent, and time of violation and the damage or potential damage.

(B) A notice that the violation or the potential violation cease and desist or, in appropriate cases, the specific correction action to be taken within a given time. A civil penalty may be issued with the order.

(C) Effective Date. The cease and desist order issued under this section shall become effective immediately upon receipt by the person to whom the order is directed.

(D) Compliance. Failure to comply with the terms of a cease and desist order can result in enforcement actions including, but not limited to, the issuance of a civil penalty.

(c) Any person who undertakes any activity within a regulated wetland or its buffer without first obtaining a permit required by this chapter, except as allowed in FMC 14.15.090, or any person who violates one or more conditions of any permit required by this chapter or of any order issued pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, shall incur a penalty allowed per violation. In the case of a continuing violation, each permit violation and each day of activity without a required permit shall be a separate and distinct violation. The penalty amount shall be set in consideration of the previous history of the violator and the severity of the environmental impact of the violation. The penalty provided in this subsection shall be appealable to the superior court with the subject jurisdiction.

(d) Aiding or Abetting. Any person who, through an act of commission or omission, procures, aids, or abets in the violation shall be considered to have committed a violation for the purposes of the penalty.

(e) Notice of Penalty. Civil penalties imposed under this section shall be imposed by a notice in writing, either by certified mail with return receipt requested or by personal service, to the person incurring the same from the Department of Ecology and/or the city of Forks, or from both jointly. The notice shall describe the violation, approximate the date(s) of violation, and shall order the acts constituting the violation to cease and desist, or, in appropriate cases, require necessary correction action within a specified time.

(f) Application for Remission or Mitigation. Any person incurring a penalty may apply in writing within 30 days of receipt of the penalty to the planning director for remission or mitigation of such penalty. Upon receipt of the application, the planning director may remit or mitigate the penalty only upon a demonstration of extraordinary circumstances, such as the presence of information or factors not considered in setting the original penalty.

(g) Orders and penalties issued pursuant to this subsection may be appealable as provided for in FMC 14.15.200.

(h) Criminal penalties shall be imposed on any person who wilfully or negligently violates this chapter or who knowingly makes a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record or other document filed or required to be maintained under this chapter, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device, record or methodology required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or pursuant to a wetland permit.

(2) Restoration or Mitigation Required. When a wetland or its buffer has been altered in violation of this title, all ongoing development work shall stop and the critical area shall be restored, or mitigation shall be required. The planning director shall have the authority to issue a "stop-work" order to cease all ongoing development work and order restoration, rehabilitation, mitigation, or replacement measures at the owner’s or other responsible party’s expense to compensate for violation of provisions of this title.

(a) Requirement for Restoration Plan. All development work shall remain stopped until a restoration or mitigation plan is prepared and approved by the city. Such a plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional using the currently accepted scientific principles and shall describe how the actions proposed meet the minimum requirements described in subsection (3) of this section. The planning director shall, at the violator’s expense, seek expert advice in determining the adequacy of the plan. Inadequate plans shall be returned to the applicant or violator for revision and resubmittal.

(b) Minimum Performance Standards for Restoration. The following minimum performance standards shall be met for the restoration of a wetland; provided, that if the violator can demonstrate that greater functions and habitat values can be obtained, these standards may be modified:

(i) The historic structure, functions, and values of the affected wetland shall be restored, including water quality and habitat functions;

(ii) The historic soil types and configuration shall be replicated;

(iii) The wetland and buffers shall be replanted with native vegetation that replicates the vegetation historically found on the site in species types, sizes, and densities. The historic functions and values should be replicated at the location of the alteration; and

(iv) Information demonstrating compliance with other applicable provisions of this title shall be submitted to the planning director.

(c) Site Investigations. The planning director is authorized to make site inspections and take such actions as are necessary to enforce this title. The planning director shall present proper credentials and make a reasonable effort to contact any property owner before entering onto private property.

(3) The planning director may request as part of a civil order, or may enter into a settlement agreement to resolve an alleged violation of this chapter, of a party to have found to have violated, or alleged to have violated this chapter, a restoration or mitigation plan meeting the requirements of this section. Any such plan shall be subject to expert review at the party’s expense. (Ord. 550 § 13, 2007; Ord. 341 § 8.2, 1992)


14.15.250      Nonconforming activities.

A regulated activity which was approved prior to the passage of this chapter and to which significant economic resources have been committed pursuant to such approval, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following:

(1) No such activity shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in any way that increases the extent of its nonconformity without a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter;

(2) Except for cases of discontinuance as part of normal agricultural practices, if a nonconforming activity is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any resumption of the activity shall conform to this chapter. (Ord. 341 § 9, 1992)


14.15.260      Judicial review.

(1) Any decision or order issued by the planning director pursuant to this chapter, including decisions concerning denial, approval, or conditional approval of a wetland permit, may be judicially reviewed in the Clallam County superior court, provided that:

(a) Available administrative remedies, including appeals available pursuant to FMC 14.15.200, have been exhausted; and

(b) Such review is commenced by the filing with the court and the planning director of a legal action within 30 working days after service of such order or issuance of notice of such decision, as the case may be.

(2) Based on these proceedings and the decision of the court, the planning director may, within the time specified by the court, elect to:

(a) Institute negotiated purchase or condemnation proceedings to acquire an easement or fee interest in the applicant’s land;

(b) Approve the permit application with lesser restrictions or conditions; or

(c) Other appropriate actions ordered by the court that fall within the jurisdiction of the planning director. (Ord. 341 § 10, 1992)


14.15.270      Assessment relief.

The assessor of Clallam County shall consider wetland regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped wetland who has dedicated an easement or entered into a perpetual conservation restriction with the city of Forks or a nonprofit organization to permanently control some or all regulated activities in the wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with these restrictions. Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessments on the controlled wetland to defray the costs of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water mains.

14.20.740      Permitted uses.

Developments permitted on properties designated as geologically hazardous shall be the same as those permitted in the underlying zoning classification subject to the standards of this chapter and article. (Ord. 342 § 530, 1992)


14.20.750      Classification and designation.

(1) Classification. The following definitions and terms shall be used in classifying geologically hazardous areas:

(a) Erosion Hazard Area. Any area containing soils which meet one of the following conditions:

(i) Soils or soil complexes described and mapped within the soil survey of Clallam County as having a moderate, severe or very severe erosion hazard potential, and soils of the Elwha, Clallam and Yeary series when occurring on slopes 15 percent or greater. 

(ii) Any soil sloping greater than or equal to 40 percent.

(b) Landslide Hazard Area. Any area potentially subject to mass movement due to a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. The following areas are considered to be subject to landslide hazards:

(i) Areas of historic failures or potentially unstable slopes, such as areas mapped within the Soils Conservation Service slide hazard area studies; marine bluffs; and areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, or landslides on maps published by the United States Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources Division of Geology and Earth Resources.

(ii) Any area with a combination of:

(A) Slopes 15 percent or steeper; and

(B) Slowly permeable soils (typically silt and clay) frequently interbedded with granular soils (predominantly sand and gravel); and

(C) Springs or seepage from perched water tables.

(iii) Any slope 40 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock.

(iv) Slopes greater than 80 percent subject to rockfall during seismic shaking.

(v) Any area potentially unstable as a result of rapid stream incision (e.g., ravine side walls), stream bank erosion or undercutting by wave action (e.g., marine bluffs).

(vi) Any area located on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or deposition of stream-transported sediments.

(vi) Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness, such as bedding planes, joint systems and fault planes in subsurface materials.

(c) Seismic Hazard Areas. Any area subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, or surface faulting. These conditions occur in areas of loose sand or gravel, peat, artificial fill and landslide materials, poorly drained soils with greater than 50 percent silt and very little coarse material, soil units with high organic content, unconsolidated, recent (post-glacial), fine-grained alluvium in low areas subject to frequent saturation, and areas of artificial fill. These areas are considered likely to experience some sort of surficial disturbance under anticipated earthquake loads.

(2) Designation. Lands classified as erosion, landslide or seismic hazards are hereby designated as geologically hazardous areas and are subject to the procedures and standards of this chapter and article. Geologically hazardous areas shall be mapped whenever possible. These maps shall be advisory and used by the administrator to provide guidance in determining applicability of the standards to a property.

All development within designated seismic hazard areas shall adhere to the following standards:

(1) Land Divisions. No new lot or parcel shall be created in a seismic hazard area without placing a note on the face of the plat which indicates the presence of a potential hazard and encourages the builder to have any structure designed by a civil engineer to withstand potential seismic activity.

(2) Utilities. Construction of public and private utility corridors may be allowed in seismic hazard areas; provided, that a geotechnical report (Article VIII) indicates that such alteration will not subject the area and development to the risk of earthquake. Utility corridors which carry oil, gas or any other hazardous substance transmission facility shall be prohibited in seismic hazard areas.

(3) Critical Facilities. Critical facilities shall not be sited within seismic hazard areas unless such facilities meet the following criteria:

(a) No feasible alternative site is available; and

(b) A preliminary or shallow geotechnical report (Article VIII) evaluation demonstrates how the proposed construction will adequately protect the proposed development from earthquake.

(4) Construction on Artificial Fills.

Development permitted on lands or shorelands designated as having a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water shall be the same as those permitted in the underlying zoning classification subject to the restrictions and standards of this chapter and article. (Ord. 342 § 720, 1992)


14.20.850      Classification and designation.

(1) Classification. All city of Forks lands and shorelands shall be classified as having either a high, moderate or low aquifer recharge potential. At a minimum, classification shall be based on soil permeability as described within the soil survey of Clallam County. Where adequate information is available, aquifer recharge potential shall be further classified based on the recharge potential of surficial geologic materials, depth to ground water, and topography (i.e., slopes). Lands classified as having a high, moderate or low aquifer recharge potential shall also be classified as having a high, moderate or low susceptibility to contamination of an underlying aquifer, respectively. Based on these criteria, the potential for recharging aquifers or transmitting contaminants to the underlying aquifer is greatest where the aquifer is close to the ground surface, where ground surface slopes are minimal, and where the recharge potential of the soils and/or surficial geologic material is greatest.

(2) Designation. All lands and shorelands classified as high aquifer recharge potential and aquifer susceptibility are hereby designated as areas with critical recharging effect or aquifers used for potable water. (Ord. 355 § 3, 1993; Ord. 342 § 730, 1992)

*Code reviser’s note: Attachments A, B, and C are attached to Ordinance No. 397 and on file in the office of the clerk/treasurer.


15.20.010      Purpose.

The State Legislature in 1991 passed legislation requiring the Department of Transportation to develop an access program for permitting access to properties adjacent to state highways. Pursuant to this legislation, incorporated municipalities were to have adopted access standards for their jurisdictions by the Spring of 1993. Based upon this authority, WSDOT and the city of Forks utilities superintendent have agreed that the utilities superintendent will have the authority to approve access to SR 101 within the city limits. In addition, the city of Forks utilities superintendent will have the responsibility of ensuring that any such access complies with WSDOT specifications. (Ord. 397 § 1, 1995)


15.20.020      Permit required.

Upon adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, all owners of real property seeking to have access to their property from any city or state roadway within the incorporated limits of the city of Forks shall obtain, at no cost to the applicant, a street access permit from the city utilities superintendent. (Ord. 397 § 2, 1995)


15.20.030      Permit process.

The following permit process shall be utilized by the city utilities superintendent:

(1) The city of Forks utilities superintendent shall make available to the public a no-fee permit application to be utilized by owners of real property (applicant) seeking access to their property via city or state roadways.

(2) The applicant shall be required to complete the no-fee permit application, similar to that found as Attachment A to the ordinance codified in this section, and submit it to the city utilities superintendent for approval, modification, or denial.

(3) Upon the receipt of the applicant’s request, the city utilities superintendent, within 14 days of receipt, shall review the application and, if approving the application, shall determine in writing (see Attachment B, sample supervisor’s report) which of the following design standards for the access approach shall be required:

(a) Commercial;

(b) Noncommercial – Type A or Type B.

(4) In reviewing the application for approval, modification, denial, as well as determining the appropriate design standard, the city utilities superintendent shall consider site plans, vehicle trip generation, type of vehicles using the approach, location and proximity to other approaches, location and proximity to city and/or state roadways and bridges, other approaches to the property, speed limits associated with the city and/or state roadway, and the impact upon the public’s safety if the application is improved.

(5) In approving an application and specifying the appropriate design standards to be utilized (Attachment C), the city utilities superintendent can require placement of culvert and stormwater drainage devices to prevent adverse stormwater impacts to either adjacent properties or the city and/or state roadways.

(6) Any decision of the city utilities superintendent regarding an application must be conveyed in writing to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the application. The decision shall include a statement explaining to the applicant that they have the right to appeal this decision before the Forks planning commission and that the applicant must request in writing such an appeal within 14 days of receipt of the decision. Failure to request an appeal in that period of time waives the applicant’s right of appeal and the decision becomes final. (Ord. 397 § 3, 1995)


15.20.040      Appeal of city utilities superintendent’s decision.

Any applicant may appeal the decision of the city utilities superintendent; provided, that the following procedures are complied with:

Chapter 17.20       R-1 – VERY LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sections:

17.20.010  Purpose.

17.20.020  Land uses.

17.20.030  Lot/yard minimum standards.

17.20.040  Height/density regulations.


17.20.010      Purpose.

The purpose of this district is to comply with the comments received from CTED, dated October 21, 1997, regarding the keeping of "densities low inside the incorporated urban growth area where urban services are not currently available...". The zone consists of properties that currently have little or no infrastructure in place, yet were placed into the agreed upon urban growth area in 1991. The R-1 zones are likely areas where urban development and/or infill development will occur in time, however, the density and lot size requirements take into account the undeveloped nature of the property within the zones. When roadways, electrical power, water service and telephone services are expanded into these areas by developers or utilities, then those areas would become candidates for rezoning into another zone. While sewer is an urban service, current state law permits the usage of septic systems through Washington, therefore sewer expansion is not necessarily mandated of developers attempting to obtain a rezone. The parcel size is such that upon the installation of the infrastructure noted above, the minimum sized lots could be redivided via a subdivision application or short plat application depending upon how the parcel in question is rezoned. Examples of very low density residential, however not limited to said examples, would be the parcels of commercial forest that exist to the west of Andersonville, the area associated with the southwestern portions of the FUGA, and portions of property between Merchant Road and Elk Valley along the Calawah River. (Ord. 433 § 4.10, 1997)


17.20.020      Land uses.

Land uses associated with this zoning designation are found in the column marked "(Very Low Density) Residential 1" of the land use matrix found at FMC 17.15.060. Procedures associated with obtaining permits for special and conditional uses are found elsewhere within this title. When considering all activities and application of this code to said activities, the applicant and the city need to also review Chapter 17.75 FMC, Special Conditions. (Ord. 433 § 4.20, 1997)


17.20.030      Lot/yard minimum standards.

(1) Minimum lot area: five acres.

(2) Minimum lot depth: 150 feet.

(3) Minimum lot width: 200 feet.

(4) Minimum Front Yard. Minimum front yard setback shall be 20 feet from the applicable lot line when considering the extension, expansion, or replacement of existing buildings and the construction of new buildings. However, upon a finding by the city building inspector that no impairment would occur to the public’s safety, or the ability of fire fighters or police to access the property in the event of an emergency, this setback may be administratively reduced by said official to 15 feet. Such a decision shall also be based upon the existing lot size and/or existing building placement. 

(5) Minimum Side Yard. Minimum side yard setback shall be 15 feet from the applicable lot line when considering the extension, expansion, or replacement of existing buildings and the construction of new buildings. However, upon a finding by the city building inspector that no impairment would occur to the public’s safety, or the ability of fire fighters or police to access the property in the event of an emergency, this setback may be administratively reduced by said official to 10 feet.

(6) Minimum Rear Yard. Minimum rear yard setback shall be 10 feet from the applicable lot line when considering the extension, expansion, or replacement of existing buildings and the construction of new buildings. (Ord. 481 § 1, 2001; Ord. 433 § 4.30, 1997)


17.20.040      Height/density regulations.

(1) Maximum Building Height.

(a) Maximum building height shall be 32 feet. However, said height restriction can be exceeded upon obtaining written prior approval from the designee of the fire district that the building shall not constitute a fire hazard that could not be addressed by the fire district, as well as a written statement that the manner in which the building is being proposed for construction will not constitute a threat to public safety. In addition, any such building would be required to meet the Uniform Building Code’s wind and fire protection requirements. Written approval from the designee of the fire district shall accompany any building permit application for a building exceeding this height restriction. In some cases, a building exceeding the height restriction may also be subject to the State Environmental Policy Act which could result in the height restriction being required for reasons associated with environmental concerns.

(b) In no case, does permission from the designee of the fire district equate to permission to proceed with construction from the city.

(c) The above does not apply to those structures (mechanical appurtenances, chimneys, water tanks, etc., constituting no more than 15 percent of the total building or site area) noted within FMC 17.75.090. Regarding those types of structures, approval of the Forks planning commission shall still be required.

(2) Maximum Density. In granting a conditional use permit for multiple-family dwelling structures, the Forks planning commission shall determine that the proposed multiple-family dwelling structure together with any existing development and anticipate future development of permitted uses within the block in which development is proposed will not result in a density level exceeding one dwelling unit per five acres. In considering planned unit developments the density of this zone shall be one unit per five acres. (Ord. 446 § 1, 1998; Ord. 433 § 4.40, 1997)

However, said height restriction can be exceeded upon obtaining written prior approval from the designee of the fire district that the building shall not constitute a fire hazard that could not be addressed by the fire district, as well as a written statement that the manner in which the building is being proposed for construction will not constitute a threat to public safety. In addition, any such building would be required to meet the Uniform Building Code’s wind and fire protection requirements. Written approval from the designee of the fire district shall accompany any building permit application for a building exceeding this height restriction. In some cases, a building exceeding the height restriction may also be subject to the State Environmental Policy Act which could result in the height restriction being required for reasons associated with environmental concerns.

(b) In no case, does permission from the designee of the fire district equate to permission to proceed with construction from the city.

(c) The above does not apply to those structures (mechanical appurtenances, chimneys, water tanks, etc., constituting no more than 15 percent of the total building or site area) noted within FMC 17.75.090. Regarding those types of structures, approval of the Forks planning commission shall still be required.

(2) Maximum Density. In granting a conditional use permit for multiple-family structures, the Forks planning commission shall determine that the proposed multiple-family dwelling structure, together with any existing development and anticipated future development of permitted uses within the block in which the development is proposed will not result in a density level exceeding five dwelling units per acre. In considering planned unit developments the density in this area shall not exceed five units per acre. (Ord. 446 § 1, 1998; Ord. 433 § 6.40, 1997)

17.52.010      Purpose.

The purpose of this district is to create a specific zoning designation for those lands owned by the public entities located within the city of Forks as currently incorporated, and within those parts of the Forks urban growth area subject to future annexation by the city. By creating a specific zoning designation for the public lands located within the city, and creating a specific zoning code chapter for the regulation of those lands, the objective is to reduce uncertainty as to which part of the zoning code applies to projects undertaken on public land. Lot sizes shall be allowed to be made as small as reasonably necessary, as determined by the city planner in consultation with the city building inspector and the city public works superintendent, to address the public purpose and need for which the application is being submitted. Public lands subject to this chapter shall be only those lands so designated by the city council and shall not include those lands identified as being part of the Forks industrial park zone. (Ord. 502 § 2, 2002)


17.52.020      Land uses.

(1) General. All lands associated with this zoning designation are found in the column marked "Public Land" in the land use matrix found at FMC 17.15.060, subject to the specific considerations noted below. Procedures associated with obtaining permits for special and conditional uses are found elsewhere within this title. When considering all activities and application of this code to said activities, the applicant and the city need to review Chapter 17.75 FMC, Special Conditions.

(2) Specific use issues limited solely to this zoning designation. The following situations shall apply to this zone:

(a) Expansion of an Existing Public Building. The expansion of any existing public building shall not require any special or conditional use permit; provided, that the expansion does not expand the existing building by more than 20 percent of the existing building’s total gross square footage and more than 10 percent of the building’s total square footage associated with the building’s footprint. Any expansion of an existing public building beyond these parameters shall require the permits as noted herein.

(b) Public Building. 

(i) Special Use Permit. Any public building that is solely used for the purposes of storing equipment associated with the maintenance of public lands or public utilities shall require a special use permit. The city planner shall ensure that lighting, access and manner of construction creates only a limited amount of impact in the immediate area of the facility’s location.

(ii) Conditional Use Permit. Any other public building shall require a conditional use permit.

(c) Utilities, Other Than Power/Sewer. Utility uses not associated with roadway, utility or drainage rights-of-way and exempted from the application of this title elsewhere within this code, shall be regulated as follows:

(i) Special Use Permit. Structures, buildings, and/or facilities being less than 150 square feet in size that shall require a special use permit; provided:

(A) Will not be used as places of work for utility personnel; and

(B) Will not pose a scientifically identified risk to the public health.

The city planner has the authority to require of the utility provider mitigations that would allow for the structure, building and/or facilities in question to blend in with the overall character of the neighborhood in which such a structure, building and/or facility shall be located.

(ii) Conditional Use Permit. Any other utility use, unless noted elsewhere within the land use matrix or exempted by the general provisions of this code, shall require a conditional use permit. The city planner has the authority to require of the utility provider mitigations that would allow for the structure, building and/or facilities in question to blend in with the overall character of the neighborhood in which such a structure, building and/or facility shall be located.

(iii) Towers shall be regulated in a manner as noted elsewhere within this code; provided, that the term tower shall not apply to any device that is attached to the roof of a public building and that does not extend more then 15 feet above the roof of said business even if the device is used for the transmission of communication signals.

(3) Open Space. The designation of lands as both public lands and open space shall be as found on the Forks zoning map and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 502 § 2, 2002)


17.52.030      Minimum lot standards.

(1) Minimum lot area: 200 square feet.

(2) Minimum setbacks when use is adjacent to a residential use: 10 feet from the applicable lot line. (Ord. 502 § 2, 2002)


17.52.040      Height regulations.

(1) Maximum building height shall be 32 feet. However, said height restriction can be exceeded upon obtaining written prior approval from the fire chief that building shall not constitute a fire hazard that could not be addressed by the fire district, as well as, a written statement that the manner in which the building is being proposed for construction will not constitute a threat to public safety. In addition, any such building would be required to meet the Uniform Building Code’s wind and fire protection requirements. Written approval of the fire chief shall accompany any building permit application for a building exceeding this height restriction. In some cases, a building exceeding the height restriction may also be subject to the State Environmental Policy Act which could result in the height restriction being required for reasons associated with environmental concerns. 

(2) In no case, does permission from the fire chief equate to permission to proceed with construction from the city.

(3) The above does not apply to those structures (mechanical appurtenances, chimneys, water tanks, etc., constituting no more than 15 percent of the total building or site area) noted within FMC 17.75.090. Regarding those types of structures, approval of the Forks planning commission shall still be required. (Ord. 502 § 2, 2002)


17.52.050      End of or abandonment of ownership by public entity. 

If any property, so designated as public land pursuant to this chapter, is sold, or divested in some manner as to end the public ownership and the accompanying public use, said land shall no longer be considered public land. In such a situation, the land shall become zoned in a manner that is consistent with the land use immediately adjacent to the parcel in question with the designation being that found to be on a majority of the edges of the parcel in question.

17.65.010      Adoption of the Forks urban growth area critical areas map.

The Forks urban growth area critical area ordinance map, developed as part of the GMA comprehensive plan for the FUGA, is hereby adopted and incorporated as part of this title. Compliance with the critical areas ordinance, as well as state and federal law, must be a factor in granting any permits, variances, special and conditional uses in an area that is designated on the critical areas map. (Ord. 433 § 13.10a, 1997)


17.65.020      Compliance with critical areas ordinance.

(1) Any property that is located within or immediately adjacent to a critical area, as designated upon the critical areas map, shall be subject to the critical areas ordinance for the city of Forks. In addition, any such property subject to said ordinance shall have all uses treated as a special use, in which a special use permit shall be required. In addition, all uses shall require the completion of a State Environmental Policy Act checklist and determination regarding impacts by the city planning department. A special fee shall be established that combines these procedures in order to reduce costs to the affected property owners.

(2) Any owner with property located within a designated critical area may elect to proceed with the development of their property pursuant to the density transfer provisions found in Chapter 17.70 FMC. (Ord. 433 § 13.10b, 1997)

(1) Any permitting process associated with zoning and land use that is to occur within, adjacent to or that could have an impact directly upon the shoreline of any navigable river or stream shall comply with the Shoreline Management Act. Until the city of Forks has adopted a shoreline management policy, the city shall utilize the current Clallam County shoreline management plan’s procedures.

(2) In addition, any permitting process associated with zoning and land use that takes place within 200 feet from the high water mark of the Calawah and Bogachiel Rivers shall comply with the requirements of this section. (Ord. 433 § 13.20, 1997)


17.65.040      Adoption of the FIRM maps associated with the Forks urban growth area.

The flood insurance rate map for the city of Forks and for panel 585/725 for Clallam County are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference into this zoning code. The information found therein may or may not be included upon the critical areas map described elsewhere within this chapter. (Ord. 433 § 13.30a, 1997)


17.65.050      Regulations associated with property found to be within a 100-year floodplain.

(1) Any property that is located in, partially covered by or immediately adjacent to the 100-year floodplain (designated as a "zone a*-" in the floodplain maps) shall have all uses treated as a special use, except for those uses associated with family dwellings not to include home enterprises, in which a special use permit shall be required. In addition, all uses shall require the completion of a State Environmental Policy Act checklist and determination regarding impacts by the city planing department. A special fee shall be established that combines these procedures in order to reduce costs to the affected property owners.

(2) No structure, fill, use or storage shall be permitted within the 100-year flood zone which because of its bulkiness, flimsiness, light weight, floating or potential hazardous conditions could be damaged or dislodged and carried onto other property, or obstruct the flow of water, or reduce the capacity of water storage areas during high water. Such conditions may be imposed that will reasonably eliminate the potential hazards.

(3) Where structures are permitted, special construction methods may be required by the city planning department and building inspector to protect any sewer, water, electrical, gas or other utility service connected to the structure. All such permitted special construction must comply with the appropriate building codes.

(4) Any structure, other than those exempt, may be permitted by the planning department without a special use permit, if the developer can provide a set of engineered certified plans and a bond showing said project has been engineered to withstand a 100-year flood without significant structural damage to the structure or property.

Chapter 17.70       DENSITY TRANSFERS – OPTIONAL LAND USE FOR PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CRITICAL AREAS

Sections:

17.70.010  Purpose.

17.70.020  Declaration of intent to utilize this chapter.

17.70.030  Calculation of density for development portion and nondevelopment portions.

17.70.040  Notice of decision.

17.70.050  Appeal and standing.

17.70.060  Rezone of parcels associated with a density transfer.

17.70.070  Dedication of lands to public entity.

17.70.080  Explanatory example.


17.70.010      Purpose.

This is an optional land use regulation that permits a land owner, whose property contains land or habitat features subject to the city of Forks critical areas ordinance (e.g., wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, etc.) or subject to the Shoreline Management Act, FIRM flood insurance rate maps, or other state laws to transfer the density associated with the unusable portion of the parcel to the remaining portion of the parcel. (Ord. 433 § 14.10, 1997)


17.70.020      Declaration of intent to utilize this chapter.

(1) Upon application to the city or county planning department to subdivide, short plat, or develop a parcel of land that contains a critical area noted in FMC 17.70.010, the owner shall declare on their application whether or not they intend to employ this portion of the code. Failure to do so at the time of application shall waive subsequent use of this section on the parcel being developed, unless, the application is denied by the planning department. In such a situation, subsequent applications or applicants can utilize this zoning option.

(2) The planning director shall ensure that the applicant is advised of this option prior to submission of the plan either in writing or during a preliminary meeting with the developer. No additional fee, beyond the cost of publication, shall be required of the applicant invoking this option. (Ord. 433 § 14.20, 1997)


17.70.030      Calculation of density for development portion and nondevelopment portions.

Upon receipt of an application that indicates a developer’s intent to utilize this regulatory option, the planning director shall:

(1) Determine if sufficient information exists regarding parcel size and boundaries of critical areas to proceed with the calculations required under this section. Necessary information shall include field inspection report as to the location of the critical area, shoreline, and/or 100-year floodplain by the proper certified professional. If insufficient information is supplied, or if the developer calls into question the planning department’s request for additional information, the developer shall be given a reasonable time to supply this information. However, in requiring additional information, the planning department shall:

(a) Put said request in writing; 

(b) Be available to assist or field inspect the estimated boundaries of the critical areas;

(c) Upon receipt of said requested information, acknowledge the receipt and state whether the additional information is sufficient to proceed with the calculation. If the additional material is still insufficient, the planning department shall provide detailed guidance as to what further material is required;

(d) Within 15 days from date of acknowledgment, make a determination on boundaries if sufficient materials were provided to permit the planning department to proceed.

(2) Confirm delineation of boundaries for any critical areas, shorelines, and/or 100-year floodplains. In making such a delineation, the boundaries shall also include the appropriate buffers required by statute, regulation, and/or ordinance. Final plat or development plan shall include these boundaries delineated there upon.

(3) Determine and calculate to one-hundredth of an acre the following:

(a) Total acreage of the parcel;

(b) Portion of the parcel that contains critical areas, shorelines, and 100-year floodplains;

(c) Portion of the parcel that does not contain critical areas, and is therefore the portion of the parcel that could be developed.

(4) Calculate the density for the entire parcel (entire parcel = buildable portion + critical areas/shoreline/100-year floodplain portion) under the zoning code designation as noted on the FUGA zoning code map.

(5) In writing and within 30 days of acknowledgment of the sufficiency of the application, the planning department shall provide the developer with the above calculations and specify therein that the final plat or plan shall:

(a) Note that the developer has utilized this portion of the zoning code; 

(b) Note the calculations of the developmental portions of the entire parcel involved, the critical/shoreline/100-year floodplain portions of the entire parcel, and the total density associated with the entire parcel based upon the zoning code at the time of approval;

(c) Note the amount of density transferred from the nondevelopmental portions of the property to the developmental portions of the property. It is understood that the developer need not transfer the entire amount permitted under the calculations established. However, failure to transfer the entire amount waives any rights in the unused remainder from future development on the same real property;

(d) Means of ownership utilized for nonbuildable portions of real estate. (Ord. 433 § 14.30, 1997)


17.70.040      Notice of decision.

Upon making a determination, under this portion of the zoning code, of the calculations and submitting that to the developer, the planning director shall publish their decision in the manner required for appeals discussed elsewhere within this code. This notice shall include information on how an appeal can be initiated, the procedures associated with doing so, and an explanation regarding standing to make such an appeal. (Ord. 433 § 14.40.10, 1997)


17.70.050      Appeal and standing.

(1) An appeal of this determination can be made pursuant to Chapter 17.135 FMC, Appeals. Failure to comply with Chapter 17.135 FMC, Appeals, and with the timelines associated with such an action shall result in a waiver of the right of appeal by that party, or any other party with an interest in the decision.

(2) Standing for an appeal. Standing for appeals under this chapter shall be limited to the following:

(a) Developer and/or owners of record for the parcel upon which action is taken;

(b) Property owners of record of those parcels of property immediately adjacent to the parcel being reviewed;

(c) Local, state or federal agencies with statutory regulatory authority or charge to regulate or protect specified types of critical areas, shorelines, or 100-year floodplains. (Ord. 433 § 14.40.20, 1997)


17.70.060      Rezone of parcels associated with a density transfer.

(1) If a parcel, subjected by a developer to this portion of the zoning code, is rezoned to permit a higher density than utilized in the calculations noted elsewhere within this chapter, a subsequent developer can use this section if the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) Sufficient land exists to create new lots, or to permit new development, within the parcel wanting to acquire the rezoned density pursuant to this code and other building and development ordinances in effect; and

(b) A conditional use permit for the utilization of the higher density and subsequent development is obtained pursuant to this code; and

(c) The planning director determines in writing, subject to appeal and notice discussed elsewhere within this code, that the proposed rezone and subsequent development would comply with the comprehensive plan.

(2) Once the above conditions are met, and the application for the new density is approved, a new calculation for the density of the parcel in question shall be made. This calculation shall use the same procedure as noted above in this chapter. The difference between the first calculation and the new calculation, done as a result of the rezone, shall be the new density allowed to be transferred to the buildable portion of either the new parcel created or the existing parcel.

(3) The developer shall record and file with the county auditor’s office the information associated with this new calculation and subsequent transfer of density as an amendment to the notes of the original plat. (Ord. 433 § 14.50, 1997)


17.70.070      Dedication of lands to public entity.

Whereby the developer or owner of property opting to utilize this regulatory option decides to dedicate the nonbuildable portions of the parcel to a public entity, said entity shall maintain the dedication for the public good in the same condition as received from the owner or developer. Acceptance of such a dedication is required, via affirmative action by the entity’s proper authority, to be shown upon the documents filed by the developer and/or owner. (Ord. 433 § 14.70, 1997)


17.70.080      Explanatory example.

Developer owns a parcel of land that is zoned low density residential and the parcel is a total of eight acres. Of these eight acres, two acres are located within the FIRM 100-year floodplain, one acre is located in an area that is designated as being steep slopes/erosion hazard area, and one acre is designated as a recognized wetland (consisting of the wetland and the appropriate setbacks). The FUGA zoning code map designates the entire parcel as low density residential which permits a maximum density of one single dwelling unit per one-half acres.

Under other portions of this zoning code, if the developer does not employ this section, the developer has only four acres upon which they can develop and from which a density calculation can be made. Thus, allowing the developer to only build up to eight dwelling units on the entire parcel.

However, by employing the above zoning option, the developer would be allowed to build a total of 16 dwelling units, if permitted by city and/or county building and health codes, on the four acres not affected by critical areas (nonfloodplain, nonsteep slope, nonwetlands portion of the parcel). The nondeveloped lands would be noted as lands utilized for the "density transfer" pursuant to this portion of the FUGA zoning code upon the face of the final plat or development plan.

The four nondevelopmental acres could be incorporated into any of the lots created by the applicant, so long as the plat notes the boundary of such on each affected lot, or the lands could be jointly owned by a housing association, or the lands could be retained by the developer, or the lands could be dedicated to the city or county. The choice would be left up to the developer and that choice would be reflected upon the final plat or development map. (Ord. 433 § 14.100, 1997)

As a condition associated with the permitting of this incentive, the developer will also have to provide a management plan for those devices as part of the permit application. (Ord. 591 § 1, 2011; Ord. 579 § 1, 2010; Ord. 433 § 15.130, 1997)


17.75.140 Sign requirements.

Signs erected within the city of Forks shall meet the requirements of the city of Forks sign ordinance, Chapter 17.110 FMC, as passed and amended by the city of Forks. (Ord. 433 § 15.140, 1997)


17.75.150 Open space requirements in new developments.

(1) As required by the Growth Management Act, the creation of new “open space”’ is a required need within GMA defined urban areas. While the city of Forks is surrounded by tens of thousands of acres of open space in the forms of commercial forest lands, national forests, and/or national parks, compliance with state law is required. Therefore the following open space requirements shall be applicable:

(a) Residential development has 20 or more lots, condominiums, apartments of dwelling units and/or mobile home lots. In such developments, the developer shall be required as part of final approval to create open space in an amount equal to the average of all of the lots in the development. In the case of condominiums, apartments, townhouses, etc., the developer shall establish one-twentieth of the entire development area as communal open space. In developments that exceed 30 lots, the open space requirement shall be established as one lot per 20 new lots.

(b) Residential development has 19 lots or less. The developer is encouraged to create communal open space. However, the creation of such space is optional and can only be required by the city as part of the final approval when the open space would mitigate some other aspect of the development.

(c) Commercial Development. When the commercial development involves the creations of retail shopping facilities with more than 10,000 gross square feet, or business/professional parks consisting of more than 10 tenant units, then open space requirements shall be created at the rate of one-twentieth of the entire development area or parcel size, whichever is greater. This space can be developed into common areas.

(2) In all cases requiring open space, the open space shall be denoted on the final plat. In addition, responsibility for the maintenance of the open space shall be that of the developer or the owners/tenants. In the latter case, a binding maintenance agreement shall be executed, after review by the city, and recorded with the final plat. Open space requirements may be fulfilled with the dedication of critical areas as open space, even if density transference options found within the Forks zoning code are utilized. In no situation may open space be utilized by the developer to meet the requirements of setbacks, front, side or back yards, parking, or buffer zones (with the exception of critical area buffers as already noted above). (Ord. 433 § 15.150, 1997)

This exemption does not apply to developments by private individuals where the dedication of right-of-way for roads, utilities or drainage is a condition to the approval of the development or the mitigation of impacts pursuant to the SEPA process. (Ord. 452 § 1, 1999; Ord. 435 § 2, 1997)


17.105.030      General design and construction standards.

(1) Standards. The following are hereby adopted by reference as the official standards of the city of Forks and shall be utilized with the design, platting, layout, and/or construction of land development improvements within the city:

(a) Washington State Department of Transportation’s standard specifications and plans for roads, bridges, and municipal construction;

(b) Washington State Department of Transportation Design Manual, latest edition.

(2) Modifications. Modifications to design criteria may be authorized where strict adherence would be counterproductive to the purpose and intent of this chapter, and when such modifications can be shown to be a safe alternative.

(3) Easements and Covenants. Whenever utilities must be installed under or over private property, the contractor/developer shall provide the city of Forks a maintenance easement of 15 feet in width centered on the installed utilities. The installation of above ground utilities on an exterior side line of a subdivision shall be so installed that the subdivision corner and side line remain unoccupied so that a survey instrument may be used on said boundary. Easements must be provided to assure the permanent ability of the city of Forks and utility maintenance crews to inspect, repair, replace or enlarge side utility lines. No trees will be planted, nor any structures, including fences, built on any such easement.

(4) Utility Extensions. If the city, through its comprehensive plan, utility plan, sewer system plan, water plan or other land use plans show an existing or future need for the extension of any utility, the appropriate action must be taken to assure construction of those utilities. Such action may include the granting of approval of the development on the condition that the necessary easement be provided to the city.

(5) Trenching. All material excavated from trenches shall be piled in such manner as will cause the minimum inconvenience to public travel and provisions shall be made for merging traffic, where necessary. Clearance shall be left to enable the free flow of stormwater in all gutters, conduits and natural water courses.

(6) Pavement Repair. Prior to the removal of any pavement, or damaging any pavement, a pavement repair plan must be approved by the city utilities superintendent. Any removal and/or damage, as well as its subsequent repair, must be done in accordance with WSDOT standard specifications.

(7) Pipe Bedding Material. Bedding material shall be placed in conformance with WSDOT standards or if standards are not applicable to a specific aspect of the development, then approval of the city utilities superintendent must be obtained.

(8) Traffic Maintenance. If traffic is to be disrupted in any way, the contractor/developer may be required to submit a plan to the city utilities superintendent describing his proposed signing, barricades, etc. Approval of this plan shall be attained before any work is started. The plan shall take into account the following:

(a) The traffic plan shall be given to the city utilities superintendent 10 working days prior to the anticipated implementation of the plan;

(b) Notification of the implementation of the plan shall be given one work day in advance of implementation;

(c) Where access to residences or businesses will be affected, those impacted will be given a copy of the plan and be given the opportunity to provide their comments which may be adopted by the city as a means of reducing any potential impacts to those affected;

(d) If access is expected to be disrupted or denied for a period of more than two hours, those individuals shall be notified one work day to the implementation of the plan;

(e) The city reserves the right to limit the amount of disruption that may result from the plan, as well as the right to require mitigation in the form of alterations to the plan or compensation for the disruption.

(9) Air Pollution and Noise Control. The contractor/developer shall take adequate measures to control dust. These control measures shall be exercised at all times, including weekends and holidays. A permit must be obtained from the fire chief for fire and smoke generating activities.

The contract will also be required to comply with any and all city regulations associated with noise and noise control.

(10) Access to utilities during period of construction. The contractor/developer may obtain water for the purpose of construction from the city at the rate established by ordinance or policy. Any such use of water, include the accessing of the water system, must be approved in writing in advance by the city utilities superintendent.

Any and all power, sewer, communications or other utilities necessary for construction must be obtained by the contractor/developer in accordance with the applicable agency’s process.

(11) Open Space Requirements. Pursuant to the Forks zoning code, as required by the Growth Management Act, the creation of new "open space"’ is a required need within GMA defined urban areas. While the city of Forks is surrounded by tens of thousands of acres of open space in the forms of commercial forest lands, national forests, and/or national parks, compliance with state law is required. Therefore the following open space requirements shall be applicable:

(a) Residential development has 20 or more lots, condominiums, apartments of dwelling units and/or mobile home lots. In such developments, the contractor/developer shall be required as part of final approval to create open space in an amount equal to the average of all of the lots in the development. In the case of condominiums, apartments, townhouses, etc., the contractor/developer shall establish one-twentieth of the entire development area as communal open space. In developments that exceed 30 lots, the open space requirement shall be established as one lot per 20 new lots.

(b) Residential development has 19 lots or less. The developer is encouraged to create communal open space. However, the creation of such space is optional and can only be required by the city as part of the final approval when the open space would mitigate some other aspect of the development.

(c) Commercial Development. When the commercial development involves the creations of retail shopping facilities with more than 10,000 gross square feet, or business/professional parks consisting of more than 10 tenant units, then open space requirements shall be created at the rate of one-twentieth of the entire development area or parcel size, whichever is greater. This space can be developed into common areas.

In all cases requiring open space, the open space shall be denoted on the final plat. In addition, responsibility for the maintenance of the open space shall be that of the contractor/developer or the owners/tenants. In the latter case, a binding maintenance agreement shall be executed, after review by the city, and recorded with the final plat. Open space requirements may be fulfilled with the dedication of critical areas as open space, even if density transference options found within the Forks zoning code are utilized. In no situation may open space be utilized by the contractor/developer to meet the requirements of setbacks, front, side or back yards, parking, or buffer zones (with the exception of critical area buffers as already noted above).

(12) Notification. The contractor/developer shall provide in writing the name, address and telephone numbers of the individuals who shall be the point of contact for all aspects of the proposed development.

(13) Testing. Testing shall comply with that specified in the adopted specifications. If additional testing is ordered by the city to determine if the work is in compliance with these specifications, that testing will be performed at the cost of the city unless agreed otherwise in advance by the city and the contractor/developer. All costs of the original work shall be borne by the contractor/developer.

(14) Inspection. All work to be deeded to the city shall be inspected by a qualified inspector appointed by the city, as well as any state agency that may require an inspection pursuant to state law. All costs associated with inspection shall be borne by the contractor/developer. City inspections shall be completed within seven days, or less, of the city being notified by the developer that the work in question has been completed. (Ord. 435 § 3, 1997)


17.105.040      Security requirements – Bonds, insurance, registrations.

(1) In order to ensure that the public is protected from inferior work, the city shall require that contractors/developers provide the securities listed below regarding bonding, insurance and registrations. No application shall be approved without the city being supplied the items noted below. Commencement of a project by the contractor/developer without the prior approval of the city, or without complying with the requirements of this section shall be a violation of this chapter and subject to the penalty requirements found herein.

(2) Requirements.

(a) Maintenance Bond. The contractor/developer shall guarantee that all of the work, materials or equipment furnished by the contractor/developer will fully meet the requirements established herein for workmanship, materials, strength and any and all other requirements associated with the agreed to materials and equipment.

In the case of failure of any part of the work, materials, or equipment under test or otherwise, the contractor/developer, without delay, shall make changes, replacements and/or renewals as may be necessary to meet fully all of the requirements and guarantees of the specifications associated with the development and this chapter.

Upon completion of the work, the contractor/developer shall furnish a surety bond to guarantee work against faulty workmanship or materials for a period of one year following acceptance of the work by the city. Upon the expiration of the one-year period, and an inspection by the city utilities superintendent, the city will relinquish the bond.

(b) Insurance. Prior to the commencement of any work covered by this chapter, the contractor shall submit copies of public liability and property damage insurance policies naming the city of Forks as an insured party, if the work is to be performed within public streets and rights-of-way, or if the work is being performed per a contract with the city.

(c) License and Registration. The contractor/developer, prior to the commencing of any work, shall provide the city planning department with a copy of a current state business license and proof of registration with the appropriate state agencies.

(d) Performance Bond. The contractor/developer, prior to the commencing of any work, shall be required to provide the city with a performance bond to insure the completion of the agreed to improvements. If the city determines that corrections to the work or the nature of the work are required, the city shall provide due notice by certified mails to the contractor/developer listing therein the problem discovered and the needed for corrections to be made. If the contractor/developer fails to make the corrections within 10 days after due notice has been given by the city, the city shall have the right to replace the defective work or equipment at the expense to the contractor/developer. Due notice shall mean written notification to the address provided by the contractor/developer and written notice to the surety that issued the contractor’s/developer’s performance bond. If the work is done by the city, or its assigned agents, the city reserves the right to execute the bond.

In all cases, the city reserves the right to take any and all immediate corrective action deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare without given notice, if a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare would exist otherwise. (Ord. 435 § 4, 1997)
